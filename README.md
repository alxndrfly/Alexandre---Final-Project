# Business problem

This project assumes we are a business analyst for a hotel review management company.
This company uses AI and LMs to generate answers based on the user's review and repplies on all platforms for the hotel directly.

The company currently operates in France, Belgium and Spain and wants to expand its customer base and growth.

Our goal is to determine which other countries in europe have the highest potential for an expansion strategy.

# Approach

Collecting europen countries' data relevant to the hotel industry : hotel / tourism statistics, internet usage per country, economic indicators and competitors presence.

Since this company already operates in FR, SP, and BG, we can draw insights on the key metrics for this specific business to thrive by identifying patterns in those 3 countries.

Then we can use those metrics to identify which countries will yeild potential growth for the company.

At last we predict the revenue that the company will generate in those countries.
