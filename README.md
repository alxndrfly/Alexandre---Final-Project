# Business problem

This project assumes we are a business analyst for a hotel review management company.
This company uses AI and LMs to generate answers based on the user's review and repplies on all platforms for the hotel directly.

The company currently operates in France, Belgium and Spain and wants to expand its customer base and growth.

Our goal is to perform sentiment analysis on the hotel reviews and classify them. Then we build a valuable report for the hotel owner containing various insights ( increase in positive reviews, increase in reviews, time saved by using our service, money saved compared to the plan cost, how quickly the reviews were repplied to... )

# Approach

Using the trip advisor hotel reviews dataset from kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/hotel-reviews/data?select=reviews.csv ).

1 - Perform sentiment analysis to classify user reviews as positive or negative ( this gives us the ratio of good/bad review for each hotel and will be used as business insight )

2 - Classify user reviews in different categories to plot by hotel which aspects to improve first. ( specific aspects such as cleanliness, staff, amenities, location, value for money, food quality, etc. ) ( Aspect Sentiment Score: Calculate sentiment scores for each aspect to identify areas of strength and weakness. )

3 - Provide a broad market analysis and insights of positive vs negative reviews and what categories are the most liked and disliked by customers etc... as a tableau dashboard.

4 - Generate an interactive dashboard for a specific hotel, aiming to provide insights to customers ( hotels ) and increase retention ( for our company ) as a web app.

5 - BONUS - Give suggestions to the business owner on which hotel to pitch next about our services.
