"“Trying to be something it's not” My husband and I came back from New York last week staying at the Hudson Hotel for 4 nights. The location of the hotel is great but to be honest that was the highlight. 
It's trying to be modern with escalators in and a great chandelier and dark reception but with scratched paint, peeling walls and too small bedrooms it doesnt live up to the price tag. It's also extremely noisy - there appeared to be some sort of club/nightclub at the back to the late hours and I had to wear earplugs even when reading. 
Unfortunately whilst we were there everything was pretty much closed for refurbishment, not great for New York Xmas time. The 'fantastic' restuarant, glass floored bar and sky terrace all not available (and although it was our travel agents fault for not telling us - we found out ourselves the day before travelling and then couldnt transfer) it did not help that at no point is it mentioned when the sky terrace will close. Apparently it is not available in the winter months - this should be advertised as some of the other hotel terraces are open.
So although the location is great, I wouldnt go there again even when it is refurbed. My advice, find something clean and cheap and spend most of the time perusing the city.",THorton810,2012-12-01,223023,2012-12-19,False,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“STAY AWAY!” I ended up in this room thanks to a bidding hotel site. It was so horrible that I am afraid to use Central Park South as a parameter again for fear of being stuck in this awful hotel.
I stay in NYC several times a year and since I use bidding sites I am often in boutique hotels, so I am accustomed to small rooms.
However this place was ridiculous. The room was so small that at 5'4"" my knees were hitting the wall when I used the bathroom. The room was so dark that even with every light on, it was still like a cave. The bed was ok but the 'nightstands' and 'desk' was a total joke.
The blanket on the bed was grotty and had clearly seen better days. The worst part was the noise from the bar. I called the front desk several times and asked to be moved, and was told that the hotel was sold out despite their OWN WEBSITE showing availability. 
This was truly disappointing, which was a pity since it was in a decent location. But based on the insanely small rooms and bathroom, noise and horrible customer service, I would actively tell people to not stay in the hotel.
Also, 1/2 the elevators did not work, during the stay.",Mrose1022,2012-12-01,223023,2012-12-18,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Poor service. Zero respect for customer” On arrival we were accused of not had paying the room fee when on booking 6 months prior, credit card details were taken and the booking was confirmed. We then got locked out of the room and escorted to and from the lobby by security. There was absolutely no respect given to us as customers and patrons and we were left feeling like criminals. When the money situation was resolved no apology was acknowledged and we did not have a comfortable stay. For the amount we paid we recieved a room that was on the smallest scale and will not be returning or recommending the Hudson Hotel.",MPG90,2012-12-01,223023,2012-12-17,True,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Not a recommendation” The stay began with our room not being ready at check-in time. Then, being told, not taken or provided for, that we needed to check our luggage ourselves downstairs via one of the 2 working elevators. Upon returning to the hotel, our luggage was not in our room (after a $20 tip to the bellman who promised to put it there when the room was ready) and was actually LOST when we returned to the hotel. I combed through the luggage room with another bellman until it was personally found. We missed curtain to our play due to the inability to find our luggage (which held the tickets) and change into suitable clothing.
We did not have a pleasurable visit at the Hudson; so much so, that we left early and after a fight with the hotel to refund the night we didn't stay. To their credit, they did provide a discount for the portion we stayed and refunded the night we didn't stay. Having said that, this is a Morgan's Group hotel and run as such - it is no longer the Ian Schrager gem it was mean to be.
To say we were disappointed that what would be common assumptions for a hotel at that level in a city that prides itself in service would be an understatement. It did not have room service, a minibar, a working restaurant, a top sheet of bed linens on either bed in our room, bottled water / beverages in the room - or even if for only for purchase, or rooms that were cleaned appropriately. The attached photos explain the frayed towels and unacceptable quality of linens, dirty paper cups that were not changed (one dirty before we got the room on a Friday but the sanitise top put on it), the empty mini bar in the room that they no longer fill as well as the empty snack bin above it, or the dirty grout that has been painted messily over in the bathroom. The floor had not been swept during our stay and the shampoos put in our room were previously used (only half full). 
This is *not* a four star hotel; I travel a great deal and have stayed in many levels of accommodations. Regardless of amenities, there is one thing that should remain true -> clean standards and customer service. Both were missing and cost hours of fighting through both the booking service and hotel after our return home to receive any compensation /reimbursement.

"“good location, fab beds” excellent location near central park and ten minutes down to Times Square. The hotel could do with a sign outside though!

"“Worst of the Worst” I travel extensively throughout the USA and can honestly say this is the worst hotel stay ever. The rooms are tiny. Upon check-in, I asked for a quiet room away from the noise of the bars. I ended up in a room directly over the thumping music that played loudly every evening. I could not turn on the air/heat or fan to help deaden the noise because the climate control system did not work. I had to open the window for air, which let in even more noise. I asked them to repair the system upon my morning departure. When I returned late that evening, the system still did not work, but instead made very loud clanking noises throughout the night. I had to pull the plug on the unit at 3:00 AM so I could get some sleep. Each night there was some sort of disturbance interrupting sleep, either a Hudson employee walking down the hall having a conversation on his 2-way radio, or guest room doors slamming at all hours. Do yourself a favor and just sleep at the airport terminal. It will be much nicer and quieter.",Joey P,2012-12-01,223023,2012-12-13,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
“Just what I needed” I stayed at the hudson for 5 days at the beginning of December. I was slightly concerned with mixed views I had read on here. All I can say is it was just what I needed I was on my own and wanted somewhere in a perfect location close to all the things New York has to offer so location is excellent. I also though the staff were great when I checked in they noticed I was taller than average 6 ft 8. So they upgraded me to a slightly larger room. I'm not sure what room it was but being on my own it was perfect. Plenty of space and a lovely comfy bed. I really don't know what the fuss is about the rooms being small it is NYC. Only disappointment was some of the hotel was being renovated. But overall a great funky hotel. In a great location and if I visit again I will certainly stay at the hudson. I also thought it was easy to sleep and I was on the 5th floor and heard no traffic noise maybe the alcohol made me sleep easier lol.,Stuart R,2012-12-01,223023,2012-12-12,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Modern chic” Stayed at the Hudson for the first time in many years. The rooms are very small but have always been very clean and well kept. The bar is still quite happening on weekends, a fun hangout. Location is excellent. Paid about $220 per night including parking, a great price by New York standards. They just renovated and now has a younger fresher feel..cool..chic",Nicholas S,2012-11-01,223023,2012-12-11,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Outstanding Service” The hotel has an unusual entrance (escalators) but the lobby is very nice. It ressembles a hunting lodge and clearly is a bar scene for locals. We booked a Deluxe Queen room for 3 nights but when we said that we were intending to have our simple civil wedding at the hotel, the Guest Experience Manager (""GEM"") immediately upgraded us to their suite (their best room) at no extra charge. We decided to hold the ceremony in their Penthouse Suite with private terrace. The Suite was extremely expensive for all but the very rich (>$4000/night) but we were able to hire it for an hour for $500. The GEM covered the floor with rose petals and candles and made it look great.
The other thing that I definitely want to mention was the outstanding service and care provided by the various concierges. They recommended and booked at great restaurants and made sure that the next concierge on duty knew everything that had been spoken between us. They arranged ground transportation and called me on my cell phone multiple times to ensure that everything was right.
One negative point which I see others have noted too is that while the A/C is very effective, it makes all manners of clanking sounds.
In summary, I would say that the rooms are pricey and too small for what you get (unless you get a free upgarde). Location is great, but what really gets the 5 Star treatment is the service by the GEMs and Concierges.",Trottamundos,2012-12-01,223023,2012-12-11,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Strange - verging on kinky” Okay, so I'm in a bit of a conundrum writing this review. The hotel is pretty awful (certainly for the price, it's dreadful - we're well travelled but I've never seen anything like it) but the staff are really nice and helpful. Nonetheless, I really can't give more than 'two stars' as people need to be aware before they pay to stay.
So we checked into room 408 the other day. (I should perhaps mention that we are a couple - quite used to the not so finer aspects of coupledom.) On arrival, we did notice that the hotel was extremely dark (decided not to eat here - I kind of like to see what I'm eating.) So, we're informed that this is their very own 'greenhouse effect' and that because it's all constructed of glass, at night it's dark. Well, trust me - during the day, it's also DARK - time to trim the ivy me thinks.
Back to room 408. We hadn't requested a 'room with a view' and if we had, I really don't think we'd have predicted the kind of view we'd get. Okay, so the room is small - and I mean SMALL but that we could have lived with. The glass 'wall/panel' between the bed (because there's actually no room at all between the bed and this particular bathroom wall) - well, it's kind of weird - or kinky - depends how you look at it really, but you basically get to sit on the bed with a full on view of the shower and toilet. There is a curtain provided, but it doesn't work (particularly since the whole hotel is so dark you ALWAYS need every light on so you can't necessarily see what you're doing but you hopefully won't trip over the end of the bed and do yourself an injury.) Watching my wife shower was okay - I could get used to that, but I wasn't so into watching her on the toilet doing her business in the morning (there's nowhere else to hide - the bed takes up the whole room.) And when I got a stomach upset on the second night? Well, I had to catch the lift down to the lobby and use that toilet instead.
I should also mention at this point that some of the reviews on here are true - if you are 5ft, 5"" or taller (based on my wife's height) - your knees will touch the wall when you sit on the toilet. For me (at over 6ft) this was an issue in its own right!
But this is where the helpful staff enter the equation. It's not their fault the rooms/hotel have been so badly designed (presumably that particular individual was fired??) We went to reception to 'discuss' the room. With no particular complaining (I do secretly suspect they are used to the problem), they immediately offered to upgrade us and they gave us a great room (room 1151 I think it was) - not the Ritz, but really, given what we'd endured the first couple of nights, we were ecstatic - no extra charge and no fuss and for that, I absolutely commend them! Seriously noisy (it faces the street and boy do the Americans seem to like 'honking their horn') but worth it! Oh, who would have thought a normal wall blanking out a toilet from the bedroom could provide such a joy and feeling of luxury??
The only other comment about the room/bathroom arrangement (room 408) when we went to reception, was that initially we were informed that the room(s) are designed for couples. Really?? Well, we're a couple, but in England, watching your better half on the toilet is just not considered normal - end of - no room for debate.
Bedroom itself (still 408) - issue with the mirrors - I realise the glass panel between the bedroom and the bathroom and the mirrors on the walls are about making the room look bigger - newsflash - FAIL - it just makes it look a little kinky/sordid. Certainly for room 408, I'd recommend moving the TV from the mirror on the side wall by the bed to the glass panel in front of the bed - this would serve a dual purpose: A) the occupants could actually see the TV without doing an injury to their necks and B) they wouldn't have to witness their partners 'using the facilities.'
So all in all - the hotel is fine (just provided you get a sensible room) - they need to deal with their 'rooms with a view' - not nice and not modern - just weird! Stick on tiles would do or even that stuff you can get to blackout windows - something - anything would be an improvement!!!!
Would I go back? Here lies my conundrum. The staff's attitude was brilliant which inclines me to say yes, but sadly, I probably wouldn't. Not unless the rates reflected the rooms standards.
I take on board what other people have said about the lack of electric outlets to charge stuff but I can't really agree on this point - in each and every room they provide an extension lead giving more than enough outlets to charge (at least I think six) items at any one time from one power source.
Oh - one last thing that was irritating. They were undergoing a 'refurb' of their restaurant and bar which was fine. They'd covered their 'outdoor area' to provide an indoor bar and restaurant for their customers. EXCEPT ... they'd hired it out for private functions every single night without fail that we were there - meaning that we couldn't use it (the one night they even served us drinks - not cheap - quite overpriced actually and then, no sooner had we sat down with them, they told us we'd have to leave!) Not really on! (the private function we could handle but they shouldn't have served us and taken our money if they weren't prepared to let us sit down and enjoy the drink).
The Hudson Hotel New York was certainly an experience though and in some respects gave us such a laugh that I do at least feel fond of it as opposed to angry at the lack of 'normality and quality' that a hotel of this calibre should provide.",Dave G,2012-12-01,223023,2012-12-10,False,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“A little too hip for its own good” The third time I have stayed here but probablly the last.
I can put up with the small room as the bed it very comfortable and I like this part of NY with its proximity to the restaurants/bistros in Columbus Circle and Central park. But .. lots of small things did not work in my room and with their facilities. 
I was shocked that at 2 pm in the afternoon this level of hotel one could not get tea or coffee. I had a business meeting and it seems once breakfast finishes at 11 am then it is only the bar that functions. 
Also there is a disco of sorts that pounds out music from about 6 pm to about 11 pm. There are 600 odd rooms and I get the impression most of those folk are not listening to the music in the outdoor area. My room on the 10 floor was very bothered by the booming base. I complained on three nights of the 5 I was there. Never did they suggest moving my room until 10 pm on my last night. They did wave the final nights bill on the basis of my complaint.
I told them they should decide either they are a disco or a hotel!! and why or why is it soooooo dark in the common areas!!",DeborahCambridge,2012-12-01,223023,2012-12-10,False,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“The""Hype"" NOT of Manhattan” Just got back from NYC. Stayed at the Hudson for 5 days... By far the worse hotel experience I ever had. We took one of the double double rooms because we wanted more space, knowingly that all the rooms are on the small size... 
I don't even know WHERE to start... My mother arrived in NYC 4 hours before we did and we had agreed on an early check-in for her, normal time check-in at the Hudson is 1500, she arrived at the hotel at 1030 an had to wait until 1400 to actually check-in... Me and my friend couldn't check-in until 1630... The room size was actually ok but after waiting that long we were greeted by a half finished setup... 
The breakfast was a joke and the reason being, apparently, it's because all the 3 restaurants are being refurbished. Oh and you can't get a coffee after 1700 in the hotel either... 
They are massively under staffed.

"“Box rooms, rude services” Stayed at the Hudson on a recent trip to New York. The room are so tiny that you can not lie your suitcase down and have enough room to get to the bed.

The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. 
As for the service, we were sitting in the foyer late one evening to be informed that the foyer was closed and we needed to go to our rooms. As paying guests we questioned this and mentioned there was not enough space in the rooms for us to all go to one room and continue our conversation.

"“Worst hotel value ever encountered” Worst hotel value ever, least functional room I have ever encountered
in a First World country!
I travel a lot for my work, staying in some of the finest hotels and
resorts in the world, and in plenty of convention hotels, airport
traveler hotels, even road stops by the Interstate. I know hotels. 
Yes, this hotel has a beautiful lobby, and is incredibly ""designerly""
-- but the designs are not clever, and do not make it comfortable or
useful. It is so designer-friendly and minimalist that it has no sign
on the front, for instance.
I stayed at the Hudson at a supposedly discount rate which set me back
(room and taxes) $370 per night. For this I got a 144-sq ft room with
a view of an air shaft. It would take three of these to equal the floor
space of a normal room. 
The bathroom was so small I could not use the toilet sitting down (and
I am 6'2"", not Magic Johnson).
There were no available electrical plugs in the bedroom area, only a
power strip in the center under the bed, all of its plugs in use. There
was no coffee maker to make a little tea in the middle of the night.
The smoke alarm was non-functional. The TV was mounted sideways to the
bed, so that there was no place to sit comfortably and watch the TV.
There was no place to sit at all except the bed and a minimalist steel
straight-back desk chair with a minimally-padded seat. The shower has
only one little shelf for the shampoo and soap - and it slants outward,
and has no lip, so everything slides right off.
Did I mention that someone barged into my room while I was talking on the phone? Evidently not staff, but another guest with the wrong room number. She said, ""Didn't they fix that yet?"" and walked back out. Huh? So this wasn't the first time this particular woman had walked into someone else's room? Was the staff giving out master keys to all the guests? After that I took all valuables with me when I left the room, and while in it deadbolted and chained the door. When was the last time I actually felt unsafe in my own hotel room?
At every turn, ergonomic, human-centered design is sacrificed for,
apparently, minimalist designer-centered design and just being plain
cheap. I will not stay again at the Hudson, or at any of the other

It was designed by Ian Schrager (designed Studio 54) When you pull up, it has no name and no address on the outside of the building. When we asked the bellboy about it, he said, it's a secret, if you know, then you know. The flame outside let's people know the bar is open, when it goes out, the bar is closed. Very cool Lodge Bar inside. Rooms are VERY SMAll, as well as Bathroom, but its NY... Will definately go back. great Euro bakery on the corner European Pan open 24 hrs.",Kasandra T,2012-12-01,223023,2012-12-04,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hotel Room Robbed - Management Will Not Cover Loss” The Hudson Hotel is not safe. During my stay, my room was robbed while I was out for dinner. When I reported the crime to the hotel, the Hudson Hotel refused to compensate me for my stolen MacBook and other (fairly large electronic items) because “those items should have been placed in the hotel room safe.”
Beyond the outright burglary (for which I was never given even $1), there is not a security key scan required in the elevator so anyone from the club in the hotel, the street, or anywhere else has easy access to guest floors.
When I reported the burglary to the NYPD, they were not surprised, saying that they had “regularly” responded to such reports at the Hudson Hotel. 
What’s worse, is that when I asked for a new room following the robbery, I was mistakenly given the key to another guest’s room (not a new room), so when I walked into room, the other guest’s belongings were already in there (ripe for the taking). 
When I explained to the concierge that my room was vandalized and the hotel responded by immediately giving me a key to an occupied room, their response was a big shoulder shrug. 
In short, the hotel is unsafe. The staff adds to the lack of security. I’m not even commenting on the claustrophobic nature of the rooms or the constant smell of pot in the hallways. The Hudson Hotel has an abundance of theft claims and their apparent policy is that it’s not a bid deal if random people go into a guest’s room. 
Seriously, I never write travel reviews but I feel strongly that the hotel is incredibly unsafe, and due to the hotel’s policies and structure, this kind of theft will certainly happen again. Don’t make the same mistake I made and have your vacation ruined by spending hours filling out NYPD police reports, talking to managers that don’t care, and reporting claims to an insurance provider who will only deny claims to any stolen item not locked in the safe box.

"“Funky hotel in a prime location!” This was my first trip to New York and I was a little worried after seeing some mixed reviews on here for The Hudson, mainly about how small the rooms were. As soon as we walked into the Lobby I fell in love with the hotel, the decor is great and we found the staff on the front desk to be very helpful. I loved the glass window behind the desk where you could see through to the garden bar with the big comfy chairs and blankets.
We stayed in a standard room with a queen sized bed. The room was on the small side, but for a couple intending on spending all day and every day of our trip taking in the sights of the city, it was perfectly suitable for someone to rest our heads and have a shower! We had plenty of room for our (large!) suitcase in the small corridor between the door and the bedroom and the bed was a welcome, comfy retreat after a long day on your feet. The bathroom was small, but why do you need it to be big as long as it is functional? The shower was very powerful and the complimentary Aveda shampoo/shower gel was a nice treat. The room was cleaned to a lovely standard every day and the corridors outside our room were always clean and smelt nice. 
As mentioned earlier, the staff in the hotel were very helpful. We asked to borrow a plug adaptor and this was brought up to our room within about 15 mins of the request. On our first night we found the room to be very hot and couldn't work the air con, also I think we were right next to the central heating pipes as we heard these banging in the middle of the night. We reported both of these things to reception the next morning and we were told a member of the maintenance team would check the room while we were out for the day. If we still had the same problem that night, they would move us to another room, which was great. We didn't experience the problem again so there was no need to move rooms but it was good to be given the option. 
I loved both the library bar and the garden bar and probably would have spent more time in these had it not been for the price - $28 for 2 glasses of wine seemed a little steep and £15 for a beer and a sprite not much better! But it was worth it on the odd occasion as the surroundings were so lovely. 
Our flight back to the UK wasn't until 10.30pm so we asked to extend our check out until 4pm in order for us to make the most of our last day then come back to pack later on in the afternoon. This was no problem and we were charged $50 which I thought was perfectly reasonable. From 4pm we were able to store our luggage in the basement while we went out for dinner, when we got back to the hotel the doorman went down to collect our luggage for us and put it into a taxi, which was very helpful.
The Hudson is in a prime location, just a 10/15 minute walk to Times Square and a 5 minute walk to central park. It was very close to a subway so we made use of this every single day.

"“Always a pleasure to come back” No doubt that this hotel has the smallest rooms in NYC and while that'll work for one person, I wouldn't put these rooms on a try with two people with luggage. However, the hotel is magnificent, the entire design of the public spaces and the humor that has gone into designing this place always make me happy. You come in from the street and there is not a single hint that this is a hotel. The bellboys are young and hip and wear jeans, the fabulous lobby and the library style lounge are pleasurable locations for a meeting or a drink. Everything has been designed with style and while the rooms are small they are very functional.

"“Chic, trendy and modern” I stayed here on business in July and was really impressed with the grandeur of this hotel. So modern, trendy and ever so chic. The limo escalators are sublime and lead you into the grand ivy sprawled, crystal studded chandelier..it's awesome!!!
The rooms are small though...if you have claustrophobia beware. He my husband been with me I think we would of upgraded to a bigger room. I wish they had long length mirrors on the back of the door-standing on the bed or peering into the bathroom is it my cup of tea! I love the brand of shampoos and conditioners..what a treat?
The restaurant is very different with a sushi style conveyor system (I think it is in the process of being upgraded) the roof top bar is ever so cool too...note you need to dress up for the bar.

"“Small but exactly what I needed” I stayed overnight at the Hudson while I was in town for a conference and I had a great experience. The front lobby is beautiful- I wish I had time to stay for a drink at the bar there- and so is the room with its warm wood paneling and great lighting. The location is fantastic as well, right off Columbus Circle with a subway stop nearby and very convenient for a morning run in Central Park. HOWEVER, the door to my room didn't really fit the frame and so in the gap I could easily hear people's conversations in the room across the way (I was worried it would keep me from sleeping well, luckily it didn't). Also the room is very small to the point I kept my suitcase out in the hall next to the bathroom since there wasn't enough room to open it completely otherwise. Again, not a problem for someone traveling solo, but I can't imagine my husband and his stuff staying in that room with me for more than a day or two.

"“Swanky Hotel in Mid-Town” I found this hotel via Priceline. The price was definitely right at $110 per night. The location was very conveinent to Columbus Circle and Central Park. It was about a 15 minute walk to Times Square. I enjoyed the area immensely. Nicole at the reception was friendly and accomodated my request for a room with a view. The rooms were very small, with little space other than the bed. There was also little privacy for someone in the shower, as there was a glass wall between the shower and bed area with only a sheer curtain. Might be awkward if you weren't traveling with your significant other or family member. One other plus was there was a parking lot a block away that was only $26/day, a bargain given this location (58th St, just west of 9th Ave.) Overall, we enjoyed our stay.",WillaRosen,2012-11-01,223023,2012-11-27,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Expensive Little Closets” There is something about the Morgan hotel group properties that always irked me when I stay in them, From the supposedly white curtains that's grayish black where it touches the floor (The Delano Miami) to the thumping this is really hip music in the lobby (Can someone tell management that the 1990's is over?) The Hudson is no different.
The lobby pumps techno music 24/7 and the staff in black is courteous but clueless. There are no room service, and if you ask for something, like a hair dryer for example, it takes at least 2 hours to get to your room. We asked for a bottle opener that never showed up.
My room is the size of two cubicles at work, and trust me I don't work in large cubicles. It fits just about one bed, and if you want to walk around the bed, you have to walk on your sides like a crab and be careful not to bump into the boat shaped ashtray thing sticking out from the wall. I have two bruises on my arms to show it. While the decor is very modern and ""designed"", the bathroom is your standard sued stuff. The shower is part of the room and if you use it, don't look up on the shower head because it is crammed with black mold. While you are at it, don't look at the air vents either, or you may find yourselves filled with the sudden urge to vacuum the dust bunnies on it. 
There is a green grey wool blanket on the bed, but it has a lot of unknown hair on it. All in all, this is a motel 6 quality place with hip designer furniture.

"“Not what it used to be” Having stayed here three times now, it was interesting to compare the experiences. The location is fantastic, and wins hands down every time. The style of the hotel is funky fun and unique..... Again a plus. The door staff and chambermaids are fantastic and try very hard. Plenty of banter and personable help. Well done. 
Unfortunately that's where the plus ends and the negative begins. 
We had a double/double room so plenty of space. My daughter and I were staying,and wanted space. The first night was totally disrupted be a leaking ceiling over her bed, which soaked the pillows and mattress. We were moved to another room in the morning. Problem number one. 
I took her out for a special meal at Le Bernardin restaurant, only to find my card payment declined. Luckily I had also taken cash, so didn't have to do the washing up. Being mystified as to why this was the case, it transpired that, despite having pre-paid both flight and accommodation the hotel had frozen the WHOLE amount for the room costs on my card. This necessitated a long drawn out negotiation with the hotel about returning the money and compensating us for the inconvenience and embarrassment caused. The whole issue was only resolved on the afternoon we were flying home. The hotel refunded the cost of the first night and waived our room bill of approximately $136, which we accepted,since this was obviously their best and final offer. The compensation was too slow in coming, and did not really cover the disruption to our holiday, where a portion of every day had to be spent being in contact with either the bank, the hotel, or our travel agent 
(who was great).
There were other more minor problems. No shower gel in our rooms, and they expected us to share a flannel!!
Apart from this, no room service, no food available in the hotel, except for a makeshift breakfast..over cramped in the library when having drinks,and noisy in the evening. 
I know they are in the process of a major refurbishment, but I think they need to focus on room quality as well as ""hip"" appearance. Having said that the beds were very comfortable. 
So you can see a mixed report. Would I stay there again? Only if I can't find a hotel of comparable location and superior standard for a similar cost, but I am sorry, it was a fun place a few years ago.",Pam K,2012-11-01,223023,2012-11-23,True,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

If you are getting a Priceline DEAL: (as we say in kindergarten) ""you get what you get and you don't get upset"" The breakfast coffee was $4.00 but it was delicious and served in a large cup.Wonderful ambiance in the library with the fireplace and New York Times - I loved it! So glad this wasn't another cookie-cutter hotel, we were well received at reception, and at baggage storage.The design elements of the room were very well done and, if you need drawers and extra hanging space for 2 - 3 days, you've packed way too much.

"“Small room” Hudson Hotel has a unique lobby entrance, as well as some decent bar/lounge options on the lobby floor (The Library) as well as the Sky Terrace. Overall, the hotel lobby area exudes a hip atmosphere. Unfortunately the positive highlights of the Hudson Hotel end at the lobby elevators though. My room was on the 15th floor. The hallways looked cheap, bare and factory-like. I stayed in a King deluxe and the room itself was extremely small. Views were of the interior terrace and of other room windows in the hotel. I could barely move around the room without knocking into something. The bed was uncomfortable and too short. The bathroom was the size of a closet and the bath tub looked like it had been cut in half.

"“Tiny Rooms & Big Attitude” I live steps from Hudson's sister property The Ames in Boston, so I thought I knew what I was getting myself into with a Morgan's Hotel Group property. I expected small but well designed minimalist rooms, a wild bar scene with pricey drinks but great food, and a great location. I was staying with my best friend and we had a very smooth check in process and were excited to see our room. It was SHOCKINGLY small. It was basically a bed with less than a foot on either side - no more than 8x10. But okay, whatever, it's NYC and you aren't going to spend time in your room. 
But... and it's a big but... no where on the hotel's website did it say our room's shower was a ""peek-a-boo"" shower that had a glass wall open to the rest of the room. Oh, but there was a sheer curtain you could draw in front of it, which did, NOTHING, because it's sheer. With my boyfriend, I've stayed in rooms with somewhat open bathroom plans before and it stated the set up clearly on the website so friends and family traveling together wouldn't be surprised or uncomfortable. I checked my confirmation's room description and it said nothing about the shower being exposed to the rest of the room. So I went to the front desk to ask if all the rooms had this and if maybe we could be switched. The response was ""well, people who would be bothered by that kind of thing would have booked a room with TWO beds, which obviously don't have those accommodations."" Did she offer to move us to one of these rooms? DId she mention one was available? Nope. Nice, right?
The hotel gets points for style and function in a small space, very comfortable beds, and cleanliness. But the hallways feel like college dorm rooms and the atmosphere becomes irriating. It's just weird. The Lodge and Library Bar are total scenes, which can be really annoying when you just want to grab a cocktail before dinner. Keep in mind, we are 27 years old and thought we'd enjoy the fun atmosphere. Not so much.

"“Not a good place to stay in NYC” Travelling as a couple we wanted to surprise ourselves with a night at the Hudson Hotel. Unfortunately it was a dissapointment. Due to a poor general air conditioning and heating system, this hotel cannot guarantee you will have a good night sleep. For the price they charge it is dissapointing, to say the least. Better spend your money on one of the many similarly price hotels in NYC which can guarantee you get a good night sleep.
Here the problems:
- Air conditioning systems in your room is very loud. Loud enough to negatively influence your sleeping. If you sleep towards the courtyard, as we did, opening the window is not recommended, because you will hear the extremely loud air con systems from all other guest rooms.
- Heating in our room could not be regulated (old heating system). The heater was at full power, and since we slept with Air Con off (it was too loud) at 4am in the morning our room temperature was at 27 degrees celsius. Sweating and impossible to sleep! A technician had to be called in at 4am to open the heating system and completely disactivate it.
- In order to cool down the room, without using the air con system, we opened the window, but as mentioned before, the air con systems of our neighbours were just too loud.
Conclusion: Beautiful hotel, friendly staff as long as you do not complain, but terrible air conditioning and heating systems which will spoil the basic service of a good night sleep. When we complained we were given a $100 deduction which we appreciate. But we would have preferred to have known beforehand and have simply booked elsewhere.

"“Small rooms, big attitude, and pricey.” Ok...the hotel was open post-Sandy with power so that was a plus, but other than that it was a disappointment. The rooms are small! stylishly designed to compensate for lack of space, but no amount of mirrors, white curtains and 'open' closets can compensate for being small! The lobby is on the first floor, it is dark and moody...the bar is under renovation, with an odd biergarten outside and 'heated' (though we thought it drafty!) the breakfast was nice but in the 'Library' (e.g. on a pool table with a few chairs scattered around - so get there early or be prepared to wait 30 mins). Front desk were charming if not over worked, and baggage help seemed to be a self-help affair downstairs near the entry. The vending machine near the elevators is just bizarre. 
It was like stepping back into 1999 - a little too much style over substantive comfort, but good location near Columbus Circle! Almost everyone was 'european' or on a 'package deal' from the mid west of america.

"“A website deal hotel” We wanted to find a hotel near Lincoln Centre and Carnegie Hall, so we asked Priceline.com to find one for us. We bid the price range of low $200 and it gave us this hotel. After tax and charges, it became about $270/night. It was not unacceptable in November in New York. The hotel's location for seeing things in New York was great.
Our room, I believe the chepest one, was very small, especially the bathroom was nearly non-functional. If you are taller than 6 feet or 180 cm, don't think about having a room here.
The noise from the surrounding street is very loud, night and day. Be prepared for it.
The overall service standard is high.

"“Sleepless and with no service in NY” This may be a great hotel if you're out here partying. If you're here to hope to get some rest, great food, a relaxing environment, please keep looking. As I am writing this review at 10:54pm on a Thursday night, the outdoor disco in the hotel's courtyard is still in full swing. They told me the incredible noise would stop at 10, then at 10:30, well, I guess we see. Funny for a hotel to create a sleep-depriving noise level like that. Other services lack, too. There is no dinner, except for two savory dishes served at the party outdoors. Unfortunately, if you're not up for wondering around finding places your food options concentrate on the grocery store across the street. The hotel also does not offer a directory of basic services, like where to go, where the gym is, how to get online, so you have to call all the time. It's just poorly managed and a huge disappointment altogether.",Britta_Sf,2012-11-01,223023,2012-11-15,False,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Don't stay here if you want space, luxury, or a good night's sleep” When the taxi dropped us off outside the entrance to this hotel, in what looked like a pretty run-down area of Manhattan, I thought he'd tricked us. There's no branding or signage anywhere, just two lime-green lit escalators up. We thought we'd try our luck, and were met at the top by a magical looking room, filled with fake ivy and dark wood, which forms the hotel reception. Clever, I thought, it's one of those 'trendy' places. The warm cider on arrival was very welcome. 
I just about managed to find my way to the lift despite the ridiculous low lighting, and once up in the corridors, it doesn't brighten up. It's a bit like being in some kind of seedy apartment block, all the doors are luminous green. Once in my room, I had to laugh at what they've got away with. It's literally just about the size of the double bed itself, and a very squeezed en suite. I could barely sit on the toilet, the wall was so close in front of me. 
That said, it had all the mod cons, huge LG HD TV, comfortable bed, good water pressure, and free wi-fi, (something I've discovered is relatively hard to come by in US hotels). I'm so glad I brought ear plugs. My room was over the bar area and the noise was unbearable. On top of that, the clanking pipes made me feel like I was sleeping in a factory all night. I've tried to understand what they're doing, but I just can't see why anyone would stay here, it's not luxurious, it's not quiet, and it's not a nice experience.",VirtualOli,2012-11-01,223023,2012-11-15,False,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Far below expectation” When I entered the hotel I loved the contemporary design and the atmosphere it provided. I was joking to my friend that we were in a submarine. However when I entered the room I realized that, ok, we are indeed in a submarine.
Everyone reviewed here mentioned how small the room is. Besides that,
1. No wifi signal at all in the room. There is strong wifi signal in the hallway. But when you closed the door, the signal suddenly disappeared.
2. Super noisy. I did understand that the traffic is very busy. however, there is no soundproof window at all. It is just a normal window which can barely isolate noisy from outside.
3. You need to ask for everything. No coffee maker, 1/3 roll bath tissue left and no replacement.
4. They are marketing for good location.however, it is actually near nowhere. All interest spots are about 10 blocks away.
The only thing good is the bed, very comfortable. But it became useless when the room is super noisy, can not fall in sleep.
It's acceptable if the room costs $50. But it costs $269+tax per night!! You can book rooms near Time square with same price but larger and quieter room.

"“Was worried by Mixed reviews but .....” I chose the Hudson primarily for its location as I was visiting my daughter in the Upper East Side. I stayed four days and have to say that I had a terrific stay.
Its everything that everyone says, very trendy, smallish - but stylish rooms (I had a standard Queen & my daughter stayed twice after Broadwaty shows - just round teh corner). I thought it perfectly adequate for two people - I really only used the room to sleep in so this may depend on the reason for your visit), spotlessly clean, very helpful & polite staff, good A/C - heating, 
The location is wonderful - near Broadway, Times Sq, central Park, & there is a brilliant Whole foods supermarket in the basement of the Columbus circle shops and you see loads of people bringing food from there back into the hotel. I liked the fact that the mini bar fridge is empty - I soon filled it from my purchases at the supermarket! Tons of diners, cafe's, coffee shops etc very close by.
I had a pretty busy schedule - it being my first trip to New York so if I had to make an observation, it would be that the bars, food on offer, concierge services, baggage services, ice machine, are all there - you just have to ask the very helpfull staff who were always happy to help whats available. I didn't need it so really didn't ask - I didn't even realise there was a rooftop bar.
I would have given the hotel an excellent - apart from the traffic noise. i was on the 8th floor at the rear of the hotel but the traffic outside was really loud despite there being double glazing (I kept thinking that there was a window open it was that loud at times). Fortunately , pounding the streets of this magnificent city combined with the exceptionally comfortable bed (and a few late nights) meant that I had no problem actually sleeping.
i thought the hotel gave good value - pretty much what you would expect from a city hotel in a great location and I would certainly stay at the Hudson again.",Phill_Essex,2012-11-01,223023,2012-11-15,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Beautiful Autumn in Hudson Hotel in New York” we stayed in the Hudson for 5 nights during 2012 Vetren's day weekend. We got this hotel via Price-line and were pleasantly surprised from the warm welcome and the good service of this hotel. Located right of Columbus Circle, on the edge of Central Park, and in short walking distance to Times Square, Rockefeller center and other midtown attractions, this hotel was ideally located for our long weekend in NYC. The room was fashionably designed and in a very high standard, the room and common areas were spotless, we got a Free strong WIFI throughout all the hotel and in the room (not at all obvious for a 4 star NYC hotel...), but most of all we loved the wonderful friendly staff.
Two mentionable important downsides which must be stated:
1. The rooms are Very Very small, even for NYC standards. 13 Sqm is very tight for a couple.... and although there is nothing missing in the room, and there is place for everything (including place for three large suitcases).
2. The windows are NOT soundproof, and in a city like New York, even up in the 10th floor, this can be quite irritating... Consider the hotel to change the windows in the next renovations.

"“My Room Was The Size of My Old Apartment” ....which was great. Even the tiny rooms at this hotel are attractive, but I was in a small suite, so I had a couch, a walk-in closet, foyer for bags and clothes, and a full bath. A nice touch in these rooms is a full wall-length curtain (reminiscent of the white billows in Miami's Delano) that can be pulled the length of the entire room, closing off the closet and the entry way. This small touch really makes it feel like a haven. It's really all about what rooms you stay in at this hotel. I could have lived in this room--and did for about eight days. In fact, it was big enough that I was able to invite friends up for a drink, which is usually impossible in a hotel room without it being awkward. I love being in the Columbus Circle area when I'm in the city and this experience made me definitely want to return to Hudson. It's true that the restaurant is under renovation, so it's not quite as hopping as it might usually be, but I'll certainly be back.",elizabethonline,2012-09-01,223023,2012-11-13,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Very mediocre stay for high price” I recently stayed at this hotel for 5 days for work. I would rate this hotel at a 2.5. 
I used to live and work in NYC so am familiar with the city. I was familiar with the Hudson as well, having gone for drinks multiple times in its trendy Library Bar and club. Those trendy days are over. The hotel is tired and old-looking and the staff doesn't seem to care much about its guests.
My chief complaints are as follows:
- I booked a superior room for 4 days and a standard room for 1 day. I was given the standard room for all 5 days and given no comp for the one day that I overpaid
- I purchased the breakfast package. The usual breakfast restaurant was under renovation so I was only offered fruits and pastries. For $40 extra per night, that was steep. In addition, there was no room to sit in the breakfast area most morning so I had to take my breakfast back to my room. Despite this, the staff at the restaurant often did not have lids for the take-out containers, etc. or bags which fit the take-out containers. Given that they had no room for seating due to renovation, couldn't they at least have their take-out containers figured out?
- My room was very small. I have stayed in many hotel rooms in NYC before and have never seen anything so small. It was a struggle to find a place to open my suitcase to unpack. When I sat on the toilet, my knees were right up against the wall facing me. I was staying alone in the room but if I was staying with someone else, I think it would have been too close for comfort.
- My room had a weird food smell coming through the air vents. I assume it came from a restaurant below, but I didn't appreciate the smell of grease as I was trying to fall asleep
- there was no bathtub in the room and the shower barely had a rim so the toilet area got wet too
- the location is okay. You are close to Columbus Circle but no much else. The hotel is all the over at 9th and 58th, so while it is not far from anything, it is also not that close to anything.
Overall, for the price of almost US$400 per night, this hotel didn't seem worth it. True, it was a room to crash in at night and the bed was comfortable, but there are many other hotels out there for this price range. Unless you get a real deal on this hotel bringing the price way down, I'd recommend staying somewhere else.",wanderingnomad469,2012-11-01,223023,2012-11-13,False,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Small clean stylish room, perfectly polite and friendly service.” The queen standard was very small. BUT very stylish room and clean, great bed and bedding. When in NYC this is what you want! Clean and good bedding for a good price! The professionalism and politeness of the staff was excellent. 
The location of mid to upper west side could not be beat. The park, museums, Lincoln Center, Time Warner building, everything mid to upper Manhattan is within walking distance. We have been to NYC many many times, stayed at many hotels, this is a good choice for the upper west side. I paid $259. Plus taxes, plus $55. Valet parking. A great price for the area. Booking.com
I must say though, if you are a large plus person, you may find the queen standard room too small for comfort. My husband and I are average plus a bit :) , and we were ok. I like clean( hardwood floors and tile a big plus! Which it had). A small desk, flat screen tv, fridge., closet area, good shower pressure, helpful concierge. Not the typical street to lobby layout, but this made no difference to the experience. IMPORTANT ... The outside of the hotel has no SIGNAGE. ( new marketing to seem exclusive...???).

I had to ask for additional towels, they only supply two large towels usually because there isn't room for. Ore!
It was also rather noisy st night despite the double pane glass.

The room was so small that once the fan came on to heat the room, we had to turn the air conditioning on to cool it. The hall way is scary dorm style.

"“Close to ideal” This hotel was just fantastic in my opinion. The midtown location is just perfect for tourists since it is one block away from metro stop, Central Park and a quick stroll to spots like Lincoln Center, Times Square and other places of interest. The staff is super professional, very accommodating and will do the best to help you with whatever you might need (trust me! I experienced this first hand) and the decor and ambience all around the hotel was just what I look for in a hotel in the city, modern but not too over the top. One thing to take into account is that it is kind of a ""young"" hotel, very far from what a normal or classic hotel might be like in all senses and it might not suit the taste of older people (it gets dark and narrow in certain places).
Also, I know everyone says the rooms are small but this is a typical case of you get what you pay for, I stayed in a Deluxe room and it was not small at all, very comfortable with a queen bed, a couch and a desk with enough room to walk around comfortably, so...I guess the standard rooms are probably small but upgrade and save the trouble (I think there is not that much difference between rates when you upgrade at the desk). One really helpful tip is to get a room with a street view because atrium room tend to be darker and smaller, even if it means a little more noise at night, which is not really that bad as I've heard people say.

"“You will regret booking this hostel.” My family came to New York so excited, only to be completely let down before our trip even started.
Don't be fooled by the marketing or website photos.
Rooms- I have stayed in multiple hostels and dormitories with larger and cleaner facilities. Honestly, unless you are 2 feet tall, your body will barely fit in the entire room. My husband had to use the lobby bathroom that thousands of people use, as he could not sit down on the toilet without his legs painfully pushing into the door. The see-through shower is right next to the bed and there's nowhere else to go (a few inches of space on either side of the bed and that's it) which is awkward. We asked to move to a larger room- a rude staff member said they were sold out, and that if a larger room was available, it would be many hundreds of dollars more a night, and basically discouraged me. Believe me when I say stay away! 
They also told me Hudson had a complete renovation. When I asked where, they told me the beds were lifted so you can place a suitcase underneath (how thoughtful), and that the lighting was changed. This is a ""major"" renovation???
The lobby and bars are hip and fun, yes, but any joe schmo off the street can experience these outlets.

"“Great experience” I was afraid of booking here after hearing about the room size issue in other reviews. I booked a king room but received a complimentary upgrade to a double room which actually has two beds that are queen size. The room was beautifully appointed and I really liked the smart, efficient touches that made the room highly functional - from the many hooks on the walls for clothing, the cool storage unit for shoes in the doorway, the extra power bar for my computer and phone, the little stools provided that are stored under the night tables - all brilliant touches that make the room so much more functional. I didn't expect it, but the touches are so well thought out! Loved the bedside lamps. 
The only downside was that the restaurant and the bar were both under construction during my visit, but thankfully there was no noise and I didn't actually end up needing either for my visit.

professional. I checked in first thing, so my room wasn't ready. Which was

I was disappointed especially given the rate. However, post hurricane Sandy
anybody would be grateful for a warm, dry, clean room. Only the room stank of mildew.
The wonderful reception team switched rooms immediately.
Room - same size as the first only with a baby tub that did not smell of
mildew. Phew had a great nights sleep.
Shame is that I couldn't wait to check out and duly cancelled the rest of
my stay. Fortunately found a better rate at a lovely hotel in a better part
of town.

The rooms are small and the bathroom has a clear glass wall (not great if sharing the room with friends or family).
Location is great- just by central park and the top of fifth avenue is only a short walk. 
The concerige were also very helpful with restaurants etc! But they do tend to recommend only expensive swanky places so be warned!

"“Small but great!” We enjoyed our stay at The Hudson for 4 nights in July. For being a compact space, the room packs a punch. We liked that it was different from the standard hotel room with the wood panelling while having a very modern vibe. The room was spotless and well equipped with extra linens and toiletries. The hotel has a great terrace and the location couldn't be better - just a few steps from Central Park.

"“Hurricane Sandy - no problem for the Hudson!” After booking the Hudson we noticed their website was informing people of renovations (not the case at the time of booking), so I emailed the hotel directly as did our travel agent. The Hudson staff responded swiftly, and courteously and assured us nothing would disrupt our stay. All completely true!
Arriving at the hotel was fun - the neon escalators are swanky, as is the impressive reception area. The lobby was full of people too (obviously a favourite for some). Mark checked us in with minimal fuss, and excellent customer service. 
It was a shame there were no upgrades available (we did try!), the rooms are small (but how much time will you really be in there??!), and the glass panel from bedroom to bathroom is a bit intrusive - it would maybe pay for the hotel to try and identify who is in the rooms before arrival - couples or otherwise - so they can allocate the rooms with this feature a bit more tactfully. Myself and my sister were not particularly bothered though - just a clever arrangment of lighting sorted this out for us.
Housekeeping was great - room and bathroom were both very clean, and the linen and towels were replenished when required. Duvet and pillows were feather (make sure you mention if you have allergies!), and the bed was very comfortable indeed.
Concierge desk was GREAT! When we realised we would not be able to make our table reservation at a restaurant on the night of the 29th he swiftly cancelled it on our behalf and told us there would be a buffet dinner in the conferencing area of the hotel, so we didn't have to go out and brave Sandy. We took advantage of this, and proceeded to still dress up in our finery and drink bubbles with our dinner! Admittedly we had a couple of funny looks from other guests, but we were making the most of my 30th birthday!
Library Bar was very relaxed with sofas, pool table and an open fire. Far too hot though - the fire is a great focal point but really no need to be on with a full bar! Also had a complimentary shot for my birthday - thanks!
Location is AMAZING! A short walk to Times Sq, Central Park, Fifth Ave etc and a selection of fab diners for breakfast close by too - we particularly enjoyed Flames - the staff were brilliant and so friendly and the breakfast was immense! 
The Hudson kept us updated on Hurricane Sandy with letters under our doors when neccessary, and all staff had smiles on their faces at all times even though they probably were not able to even get home due to the transport cuts.
One thing I would mention... And this really is not a complaint but an observation... They knew it was a special occasion before our arrival - no acknowledgement of it at any time there. As a Front of House Manager in a luxury UK hotel we write cards for everyone who we know is celebrating something, and sometimes even will add complimentary wine and chocolates in their rooms before arrival. The only time it was noted was the shot at the bar, which was only offered after bar staff realised we were celebrating. Again this is not a complaint at all, but maybe the front of house staff could introduce a few special touches to really make people's celebratory stays sparkle!
All in all, we had a fab time at the Hudson, and I am sure we would definitely go back... Although I'd make sure of a room upgrade before going... Just to have that bit more space would have been great!

"“Great location, but....” Rooms are tiny...even the ""upgrade"" queen room for which I had to pay an extra $40. Cannot imagine how small the regular room was. Bar was closed for renovation and Library bar was overpriced and service was poor. Took 3 hours and 4 phone calls to get our bags delivered and promised extra towel and bath robe never arrived. We were supposed to stay for 5 nights but checked out after 1.

"“Style but no substance” Growing up in Vegas, and having traveled around the world, I take the idea of ""hospitality"" seriously - simply adding ""upscale"" to your description, dressing your staff in all black, and having European accents, is not quite sufficient. 
To be fair, I stayed at the Hudson during hurricane Sandy, and while I understand the constraints the hotel was in during this rough period, I also don't think the hotel displayed the hospitality that would be becoming of an ""upscale"" property. 
First of all, the rooms - yes, crazy tiny, but I knew when I booked the room that they would be. (I had no idea I would be spending so much time in the tiny room due to the storm, but whatever - I survived.) However, there should at least be a coffee pot in the room - esp since there is no other way of getting a cup of caffeine without walking outside. (Hotel restaurant is under renovation and the chic library bar doesn't serve hot drinks.) 
And, I had a tiny window in the room that faced other buildings - not unusual in NYC - but the window was CAKED with dirt (well before the storm hit - which probably cleaned them up a bit) - so it really did feel a bit suffocating at times. 
Second, I was a bit appalled that the hotel charged a whopping $26 for a cold continental breakfast - almost like it was exploiting the fact that some people wouldn't want to go out into the storm. (I did - thankfully the deli down the street remained open.) Furthermore, it offered a ""first come first serve"" lunch and dinner (at a cost) to guests. ""First come, first serve?!"" come on.... Again, thankfully, nothing got so bad that I wasn't able to find better food elsewhere, but I just found it a bit distasteful. 
The bright side? Free internet, great gym, and the beds were comfy. 
Even without the hurricane, and although it is centrally located, I'm not sure this property is worth the price.

"“Would rate better at half the price” I will echo previous reviews by pointing out that the lobby maybe the most impressive thing about the Hudson, but the novelty wears off quickly. 
The beds - very comfortable. The best part, really.
Free internet worked great for us and was a nice perk. 
Service was on and off, but never terrible. 
Our room happened to be an accessible Double Double, which seemed to have made a difference size-wise. Nothing to complain about there. The Double Double provides two full beds (although a bit short for my 6'2"" companion), a small desk, a chair, a hallway space with some storage which can be separated from the room by a curtain. The overall feel is that of a ""cabin"", but with modernized design sprinkled in. I found most things you want in the room: safe, iron/board, hairdryer, toiletries, ample stack of towels. 
The bathroom looks and feels outdated. Clean-ish, but lacks in comfort and lights are a bit too dim. On the up side the Double Double room does have a large full-length mirror in the alway space, and good lighting there too. 
The floors in the room were not very well cleaned. No one seemed to vacuum the tiny rug by the desk in a long time. I'll take clean floor over impressive lobby any-day, by the way. 
There was a strange issue with smells traveling in our room, despite it being on the 9th floor: it felt like we may have been connected to the restaurant shaft. The odors of food and smoking were quite potent at times. 
That said, the noise was never an issue from the street or from the neighboring rooms.

The rooms are compact but we are from London so we understand. We stayed in both a corner suite (Rm 1645) and a Queen (Rm 918). The design was simple and sleek. The room was very clean. Convenient location to walk or take the subway.

"“Good location - small rooms, dim lighting throughout hotel” The Service was professional and courteous, rooms were clean and modern, the location for central park is nearly ideal. Less than 5min walk. The bed was extremely comfortable.
However,
The entire hotel is very dimly lit. from the lobby to the rooms. Natural daylight is pretty much blocked out - presumably to create a certain atmosphere. I found it uncomfortable.
The standard rooms are very small. There is about 1ft space either side of a queen size bed.
The view we had was just of another high rise - blocking out even more light.
The weirdest thing was the glass partition between the bedroom and the bathroom. Whilst this may set the scene for a romantic weekend, you also have full view of the toilet basin if the showe curtain is opened. This could certainly dampen the mood, esp after visiting the Carnagie Deli!
Id say the rooms are not really enjoyable for more than a weekend, and only for people who prefer dim ligting over daylight?

"“Could be so much better” The Hudson Hotel in NYC looks so good - but the reality is that it is badly let (and lit) down in comparison to other boutique hotels I've stayed at.
Firstly though, the one big compliment. With the exception of a doorman who I found to be rude (not to me but to the taxis of NYC which didn't ensure a smooth ride anywhere!) the staff were very good. From reception, to the breakfast guys to security and cleaners - though they did try to get in three times whilst I was either trying to go to the loo or shower. Thankfully the room is so small you can stop access pretty quickly!
However, the problem is there are more downsides then ups. Aside from breakfast (which I'll come on to later), there was absolutely no food available in the hotel aside from vending machines on each floor. The one or ours appeared to be turned off, and the drinks one took my three dollars and wouldn't give it back when it eventually said there was no drinks available. You couldn't even get a cup of coffee or a cup or tea - no in-room facilities - at the very least, you should be able to get a warm drink!
Breakfast was very over-priced for what it was - and unfortunately, a booking error meant that we ended up paying for this (not The Hudson's error admittedly). The food is served in the library on the pool table and constists of fruit, yoghurt, hard-boiled eggs, bread rolls and a few pastries. One of which, is discovered far too late, appeared to be date and walnut! It didn't make for a comfortable return home to Heathrow I can assure you.
Back to the rooms and both me and my parents had problems with them. Mum and Dad had to change rooms after it was discovered to be impossible to open the cupboards as the builders had put the door on the wrong side of the cupboards making them inoperable. They didn't have a fridge either (which wasn't on anyway when you got one), so they changed rooms. The rooms are tiny - from the bed I was able to touch both walls without too much difficulty. When you add cases, ironing boards and such like there isn't a lot of room to play with. From the bed you can see right through to the bathroom via the shower - might be nice with the right people, but do you really want to see someone else sitting on the toilet? Not a particularly nice thought!
I had a problem with my safe - quickly sorted admittedly - while our tv's both needed attention. In the end it became quicker to deal with it ourselves but should guests really have to unplug and then plug their tv's back in when they return at night?
The rooms were noisy with the city life below which can't be helped - but the heavy doors were also very easily slammed. When you living that close to each other, you can hear it very quickly. Indeed, my mother suggested that she'd always wanted to know how it felt like to be in prison.....well, now she knew.
In short, with a little bit more love and attention, The Hudson could be a very good boutique hotel, ideally situated near the subway and Central Park on Colombus Circle. At present though, it fails to hit the mark on far too many targets. If you're claustrophobic in any way - don't even bother.",Laitty,2012-10-01,223023,2012-10-28,False,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hudson design hotel” The Hudson hotel is perfectly situated in the Upper west side, 5 minute walk from central park.
This stylish hotel is well decorated, from the impressive vegetal selling reception to the little wooden rooms.
The rooms are pretty small but really well made in my opinion.
Decorated from floor to selling with wood that contrast with the immaculate bathroom.The bathroom and bedroom communicates with a nice play of net curtains.
My only reserved is that room is simply furnished and there is almost no closet.
The hotel itself is well designed with an outdoor terrace beautifully decorated with a giant , flowers and cozy coach.
There is also a more eccentric yellow bar restaurant. and library designed by Starck
Perfect if you like to stay in a designed hotel at reasonable price.
Actually the less expensive I could find for that kind of environment, for a short stay in New York if you planned on discovering the city.

Unfortunately, I found the room tiny and it smelled of food. The staff was accommodating when I requested for an upgrade, however they put me in a double room which was not properly cleaned/maintained (some of the light bulbs were not working). What I found most annoying was that the room was right beneath the hotel bar which was under renovation. It was not a pleasant experience to be woken up by the cacophony from the renovation work which started at 10am in the morning.

There is no signage in the front, just a flame. 
A couple of things to note: if you're taller than 5'7"" you may have issues sitting on the toilet. Not much space between the wall and the toilet. They don't have glasses in the rooms, just paper cups. For how much they charge for rooms, the least they could do is have glasses.

The check in process went smoothly and the concierge was extremely helpful throughout our four night stay booking and organising almost all of our activities.
The rooms are tiny. By tiny I mean TINY. I expected small rooms in NYC but this was ridiculous. The room safe was broken and the bed is literary centimeters from the ground but was clean and comfortable. I can not over emphasize how small this room was.
The weirdest aspect to the room was that there was a glass wall in the bathroom so a guest in the room could clearly see the guest in the bathroom at all times, very uncomfortable and strange. The bathroom was minuscule. I could barely sit on the toilet and at 6 feet tall and average weight, I'm not exactly a massive guy. My partner and I were fine with the size of the room due to the fact that we were out and about from 8am-12am every day but it would be impossible to relax or stay in the room other than to sleep as it is immensely claustrophobic. 
At night the lobby and hotel bar basically turn into a night club filled with NYC party goers, very well dressed, very high-end crowd with serious attitudes. The music blares through the bar and lobby but we didn't mind it and it couldn't be heard from the room. The bar was expensive at $32 for two glasses of the house white wine. I am also pretty certain that ""escorting"" activities were taking part in the hotel at night. Not family friendly.
I heard little street noise from my room.
The location is excellent. Minutes from Central Park, Times Square, FAO Schwartz etc
All in all staying here was an experience, the location could not have been more central and the staff were magnificent but the price is way too steep for the abissmal room size.",alanburke84,2011-12-01,223023,2012-10-24,True,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“I’m clearly missing something” Let’s start with the positives. Correction. Let’s start with the positive. (Singular, not plural.) 
Mark at the front desk was helpful and exhibited the best customer service I’ve experienced at any hotel. The best! 
As for the rest of my experience at the Hudson – insert virtual eye rolling – I think I was being punked. I’ve stayed at other Morgan hotel group properties including the Royalton in NYC and the Mondrian in West Hollywood. The Hudson is awful. Just awful. The bathroom is about the size of a refrigerator. The rooms are about 8 ft. x 8 ft. I realize that NYC hotel rooms are tiny, but this is prison cell small. 
I had to ask the housekeeper for a top sheet for my bed. She said the duvet was standard but she would honor my special request for a top sheet. A sheet is a special request. What the bleep?!?! Plus, there’s no restaurant. Yes, you read that correctly. No restaurant. Instead, there are vending machines on each floor and a continental breakfast in the hotel’s library.

"“Over-rated, over-priced and under-sized” The location may be good but that's about it. What a pretentious over-hyped ripoff. This place might seem appealing to someone who's used to sleeping in closets. For $ 350.00 PLUS we had a room with no view that might have been 160 sq. ft. if that. No coffee maker. A glass wall on the shower so you could see through to someone on the toilet from the bed? What the heck is that all about? I've been in airplane bathrooms that were bigger and the glass wall was creepy.. 
When I asked the too cute and too smarmy clerk at the front desk if we could change rooms, she told me that I was 'registered for a queen standard and that's what I was given' and 'if I'd like to explore upgrade options, blah blah blah...'. The hotel temperature was in the mid 70's. Same in the room. Set the A/C unit a little lower in the room? It goes on and off every five minutes, and the A/C unit is located directly behind the headboard! It's just nuts...

"“Funky place with a few ""quirks""” My husband and I just spent 3 nights for our wedding anniversary at the Hudson. 
The good stuff? 
$550 taxes in for roundtrip airfare out of Buffalo and 3 night hotel stay...not too shabby and cheaper than many of the resorts or inns we enjoy within Ontario...
Very friendly and helpful staff- from the doormen, to the concierge, to the front desk, to the cleaning staff- everyone was smiling and pleasant...
One of the ""funkiest"" and most unique hotels I have ever stayed at. Low lighting, beautiful ""library"" bar and outdoor patio make it a place that I can envision Carrie Bradshaw meeting the rest of the girls for a night out....
Beds were awesome- so comfortable!
Great location- within walking distance to Times Square and just outside of Central Park 
The not-so-good stuff? 
Both the restaurant and nightclub were closed for renovations, and the rooftop bar (which I read here was amazing) was closed for the season, even though it was summer-like temps and it would have been perfect to have a drink up there...
Rooms are very small (but clean)
We asked for a couple of champagne glasses and they brought us paper cups. Yes, just like the paper cups that were already in our room. They have 3 bars onsite, so don't see why they couldn't somehow manage a couple of champagne or, at the very least, wine glasses....
Breakfast and drink prices are VERY high- however, there are plenty of places within walking distance to eat and drink, so not a huge issue for us.
Would we stay again? For the deal we got, definitely! Very unique concept to experience and the staff really made it (except the dude who sent up the paper cups- ha ha)!!!

"“Suitable” Just returned from a weekend in NYC and we stayed at the Hudson. Location is great. Front desk was very helpful with every question asked. There is no sinage on the front which could be difficult for some. The rooms are small, but you are only there to sleep and they were very comfortable and CLEAN. Everything is within walking distance or by subway or taxi. My only observation would be that the breakfast in the morning was totally over priced at $ 21.99 (that is for a continental breakfast of muffins/croissants/assorted fruit/coffee/tea and hard boiled egg (buffet style). I find that a little steep. They don't offer any egg choices or toast or pancakes or a la cart. Having said that Our server was very receptive and noted that we did not eat very much and charged us accordingly. Which was very nice.

"“Trendy? Or just odd?” It is difficult to find the entrance to this hotel and the lobby is so dark its like you've entered a night club. Occasionally there are what appeared to be doormen and other times there wasn't anyone about. When we arrived, admittedly a little early to check in, there was only 1 member of staff checking people in and we had quite a wait before we could leave our bags downstairs and go out. The room we were given was on the 9th floor at the very end of the corridor. Considering it was reasonably high up it was still very noisy all night with trucks going by and a lot of street noise. The room was quite small but fine for the 2 of us with a large flat screen TV, a desk, room for both of our bags and the bathroom was adequate with nice toiletries although the shower curtain didn't stop the water soaking the floor outside the shower. I wouldn't stay here again - I know NYC hotels are expensive but I've paid the same price for much nicer rooms than this place.

"“NYC October '12” I stay in NYC every month for 4 or 5 nights on business, I have stayed at 'The Morgan Group' of hotels many times, The Royalton on 44th being my normal choice - that said, I have been staying elsewhere as I have found that the lack of loyalty program means I come and go un-noticed as a frequent guest. The Hudson is I believe, the ex YMCA building in NYC, as such the rooms are tiny, trendy but TINY … I had a double, double this time around 1416, much bigger but as with all rooms, quite badly laid out. My major concern is the lack of business facilities, the desks and chairs are impractical and the internet service was far from reliable. No thought has gone into plug socket locations, even if you want to plug in your computer you are left with un-plugging something else. If you want to use the iron to give that shirt the once over, then you have to move the ironing board into a crazy location in the room !

Near Central Park (1 minute walking) and in a quite street. The hall is very pretty. At reception we didn't have any problem.

"“majorly disappointed” we were extremely disappointed with our stay here. the entrance and the lobby set us up too much only to be dramatically let down later when we went through the lifts to the room. The lifts , corridors and rooms all have a strong odour. The floor cleaner in our corridor was extremely impolite and almost knocked us over with his broom with no apology and continued cleaning the floor as if he was in a great hurry and just scoot from there. on entering the room we were shocked to see tht the queen sized room was hardly enough for 1.5 persons to even breathe without suffocation. Some people might call it a part of the new york charm but we were not enjoying this specially given the price this place charges. The shower looked rusted and the room poorly put together and cleaned. It just seemed like we were thrown away in a store room... small rooms can really make a hotel look inhospitable inspite of whatever hardwork maybe have been put somewhere else. the hunks at the entrance will first take your bags up to the lobby level but only when u think they were being nice they ask for a tip and no they wont just settle for 5 dollars... they make a face and at 10 they will just yield a little bit just enough to make you feel like you are just a little less than a cheapster... really disgusting attitude..",gabriel m,2012-10-01,223023,2012-10-20,False,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Great stay, excellent staff; get over the small rooms” My husband, son and I just returned home from a five-night stay at the Hudson. Yes, the rooms can be on the smallish side, but I'd encourage anyone considering this hotel to get over that. You are traveling to New York City, the greatest city in the world, how much time do you want to spend in a hotel room? Even traveling as a family we were out and about from mid-morning to very late at night. 
What you will get at the Hudson is a very clean room with a comfortable bed, an accommodating, very helpful staff, and a great, safe location. Before we arrived, Ginelle helped us through a little snafu on my part, ensuring we could fit a rollaway bed in the room for our son. Once there the folks at the concierge desk were over-the-top helpful. From steering us to great restaurants, the right subway routes and offering to print our boarding passes without us asking, they were awesome. And did I mention they are the most handsome group of men you'll meet in Manhattan?

If you book a standard room or win a bid on Priceline (which you get a standard room), like we did, then you will be really cramped. Two skinny people had trouble maneuvering around the room. Also, the shower is separated by a sheer curtain from the bedroom so there is no bathroom privacy if you are traveling with anyone other than your significant other. 
There are a lot of great things about this hotel. The location is perfect, the rooms are very clean, the staff is excellent, the crowd staying at this hotel seems very young and hip. Overall a good experience.

"“I'm feeling kinda claustrophobic” I am writing this review in my tiny little room at the Hudson hotel. I paid $350 a night to experience life from the inside of a New York coffin. 
Now don't get me wrong, it is a very nice coffin, hip, with sweet accents but I can't take my sweater off without going into the lobby. I woke up last night feeling a little breathless and locked in. It is like being in an Edgar Allan Poe story. 
The lobby is huge. Very hip. Very dark, Very cool. Completely useless for actually doing anything but VERY hip.
Having seen roomrates at $200 online I figured the nice man at the front desk would push my wife and I up to a bigger room without a charge - but sadly that would cost an extra $150 (he did offer me $75 after some haggling). 
I get the sense the staff are used to this - they look unblinking at you as you express a sense of outrage at being charged so much for, well, so little. They are all EXTREMELY nice - seriously, everyone here has been awesome - but the problem is, the product is kinda crappy.
So I am stuck in a box in New York and broadcasting to the world - find something better, find somewhere else, come check out the lobby and the idiots willing to pay $350 a night for a small box.

"“Shoebox room but great location” Recently stayed at Hudson hotel. I had always wanted to stay there on my visits to New York but had always stayed elsewhere and I had heard that the rooms were small (as you will see on nearly every review). My room was the size of a shoebox and there would have been no way to have two people in the room - as there was hardly enough space for me to put my bag down. 
Some highlights:
* The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful
* Getting a taxi was no problem as there were always lots of people arriving at the hotel (other friends waited for 25 minutes at their hotel for taxi)
* The Bars give you great places to go out if you do not want to venture far
* location is great if you want to be close to the park (especially good for summer)
* small desk in room and good internet speed if you buy the premium package
* there was a place to hang clothes but no clothes hangers
Some lowlights:
* the room is so small I could not fit suitcase on floor
* no full length mirror (there are mirrors but they are not very useful
* bathroom is tiny (shower is a decent size with good water pressure) but a tall person i.e. 5 foot 10 inches and above would not be able to use the toilet easily
* not many power outlets in room - i could only find one next to desk
* would not stay in room if there were two people - would not fit 
* tv on the side wall not straight on from the bed - so you cannot easily lie in bed and watch tv

"“Rude staff” Terrible service at the front desk. They act like your business is intruding on their private conversation.
Check in process is a joke... They say you can arrive early when you book the reservation and see if a room frees up early.
That is far from reality since there's about 30 other guests waiting in the lobby or working aimlessly waiting to check in at 3pm
There must some something wrong when check out is noon but checking in is a lottery at 3pm as we've seen other guests arrive with their luggage in tow and given rooms immediately.
Again the staff does not have any manners or the hotel does not have any accommodations for their guests waiting. Their recommendation is just go check out the Time Warner Mall. They take your information during pre-registering but they don't tell you if you'll be notified when a room is freed up. So what's todo? You either wait or roam around checking back at the desk every so often and every time, the answer is ""its not ready yet."" We've travelled to numerous well known cities in the world and never have we had to wait hours in the lobby for a room or dealt with such incompetence and nonsense. 
The staff is not helpful with answering questions or offering a solution. We spoke with them at 3pm when they said the room will be available and guess what? They said ""oh it's not ready yet as people are still checking out."" You're kidding right?! You say you enforce that check in is at 3pm so that's why we have to wait and check out is at noon. So WHY is the room not ready at 3pm when you know you have a lobby full of guests waiting??? Unbelievable. This hotel is horrible and we don't recommend it at all (unless you like wasting your time waiting for a room or if you like to take someone's bad attitude at the front desk.)",E P,2012-10-01,223023,2012-10-13,True,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Edgy but small and noisy” Hotel has gone for a edgy modern feel with no name outside and funky interior design throughout. We stayed 8 nights. Location was very good with subway 3 min walk to Columbus circle and 5 min from central park. Taxi's always knew the hotel and was no more than $25 to get anywhere due to central location.
Rooms are compact and bijoux - the higher the floor you're on, the less street noise you'll get, so remember to request this at check-in. We were on the 10th floor which was fairly noisy.
Staff were friendly and helpful, Library bar has a cool atmosphere and is nice for a night-cap. There's also an awesome 24 hour diner called ""Flame"" across the road on the corner of 58th and 9th which offers good old fashioned home cooking at great prices and with excellent service and good quality food.

"“Good business hotel if you've got meetings uptown” I like to stay at the Hudson because I often have meetings between Columbus Circle and Grand Central Station. The Hudson is very convenient for this, and although it is not cheap, it really is about par for the course as far as the prices you are going to find for hotels that close to Broadway, etc. Be prepared, rooms are SMALL but this is an NYC thing. Note: IF YOU ARE A LARGER SIZED PERSON, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS HOTEL. I am a very small-sized person, and so it suits me just fine, but I can see how the bathrooms, etc., would be too cramped otherwise. I like the Hudson because it allows me to avoid cabs, I can just walk up and down 5th Avenue and get to all my meetings that way.

Even with silicon ear plugs that insert firmly over the ear canal, the noise was less apparent, but the vibrations from the braking noise would still shake me out of my slumber.

"“Not worth the price tag!” Just about the only thing that is great about this hotel is its location, which is close to everything. But apart from that, it sucks. I have stayed at ""The Clift"" in San Francisco and had high expectations for its New York counterpart but was grossly disappointed.
From the moment I arrived at 2 am in the morning, I received the worst customer service possible. The front desk ""could not find"" my reservation, thus prompting me to call my wife over on the west coast to forward the reservation confirmation... It turns out, the guy helping did not look over the guest list carefully.
Next - the rooms are tiny! Can you say rabbit warren?!? The room was literally the size of the bed, plus a tiny bathroom. I couldn't even dry myself off in that tiny bathroom. Strip away the aesthetic trappings, and you would have a deluxe prison cell. Other amenities, I can't really say. It was too claustrophobic to stay in that room beyond having to sleep there at night. 
My personal opinion is that this hotel is trying really, really hard to live up to a boutique hotel-type of hotel that appeals to the younger and hip crowd, and perhaps even justify its pricey rates. I definitely would not recommend it. I think I'll have better service and more spacious accomodations in a Westin or Hyatt.",JujuBSchmidt,2012-10-01,223023,2012-10-09,False,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“For Families” The hotel is very trendy and while rooms are small, they are well decorated with comfortable beds. Beware that the beds were only full size in our double room and a cot is $25.00 extra per night. The location is very good, but be ready for NYC street noise. Unfortunately, they did not warn us that their restaurant was being renovated, so there was no room service. If you are traveling with children, this is definitely an inconvenience. The vending machine on our floor worked, but delivered warm bottled water. Because there were many mirrors in our room, I had difficulty getting on WIFI and after calling their Tech people about it, I always had to go stand in front of our door to get on WIFI. Sometimes my iPad connected easily while standing at the door, other times I had to enter my email address to connect. I would only say the value is good if you are accustomed to spending $400 a night for a room with 2 double beds, a closed restaurant and no room service.",kimba1960,2012-10-01,223023,2012-10-09,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Location, Surroundings and Some In-house Delights” Tiny rooms. Ok, got that? - let's move on from there.
We stayed 8 nights. Possibly the most comfortable hotel bed we've ever experienced.
The location is outstanding. In particular, 9th Avenue - a few steps from the hotel entrance - has plentiful restaurants, including breakfast restaurants (Route 66 is our favorite), bars, laundries in an authentic neighborhood setting.
In the hotel, we enjoyed the ""private park"" and the library (a truly magnificant space) - when we could get a seat; both are deservedly popular.
The roof terrace bar should be superb but has an anti-people culture which is a real shame. Don't bother, except to take some photographs of the New York you can see from the 15th floor.
The concierge team are fantastic, as were the team on the reception desk.
We even came to enjoy the escalator ride as we came and went.
So, a great hotel for those who have no concerns with claustrophobia. And oh so hip.

"“Girls Weekend Getaway!!” We decided to take upon a NYC trip for one of my Best friends Birthday! The hotel was amaizing! It was very modern and nicely decorated.

The location is priceless - Central park one block away, the Columbus circle subway station one block away and Time square is about a 5 minute walk. 
The rooms were SUPER comfortable.. we stayed at the Deluxe double room which was pretty big for NYC standards. The bed are little clouds of heaven! super comfortable. One thing I really didn't expect was that the toiletries were of EXTREMLY HIGH Quality.. will definetely call to find out the brand the use. The Library bar had great ambiance.

Yes, the rooms are small, but you don't come to New York to stay in your room. The room's are a good size for a single traveller - plenty of wardrobe space and amenities.
The bar always has a great atmosphere and the roof terraces are beautiful.
The only downside was that room service was non-existent and no mini-bar. I was informed that the hotel was re-doing the system and therefore not available, however if I had know this before I probably would not have stayed at the Hudson.

To me that's important. Furthermore I love the library and the roof terrace on the 15th floor. 
Rooms are small, yes. But the size is mentioned on the web when booking and I could choose to pay more and get more space. However, I rather spend money on shopping while in NYC :) Rooms are clean, the hotel is stylish and the staff is friendly.

"“Wonderful visit until we had to go to the room.” when we arrived at Hudson, we were a little shocked at the exterior of the hotel. With no sign of any sort displayed anywhere, the only reason I decide to ask someone in front of it if this was the Hudson was that I recognized the 3 or 4 potted trees on the sidewalk in front of its single door entrance. There are no windows on the first floor either, so when you enter the door you go up an escalator which takes you to the front desk and lobby. That was when we new we were in NYC! IT WAS dark and very edgey. The bars on that floor and the one on the 15th floor were beautiful and the service was terrific. The room, however was a huge disappointment, mostly because of the smallest of it. There was a. very nice bed and about 18 inches of walking space around it and that was it for space. The bathroom was equally tiny with no room to put anything more than a toothbrush. (no counter).

"“The Hudson hotel, meh!” My wife and I had wanted to go to new York for as long as we both can remember, we chose to go there on our honeymoon. Our hotel of choice was the Hudson due to its location near central park. 
We arrived there at around 16:45 after a bit of a transfer fiasco (that's a whole other story), we went up the escalator into a reception area you would only find in new York, fairly dark but with a huge chandelier hanging above the desk and leaves covering the ceiling. The check in staff were very friendly, we told them it was our honeymoon and we got our room upgraded to a suite (thankfully, more about that later). 
We got to our room and we was nicely suprised, a fair bit of space, a sofa, good storage space, what you would expect from a standard room really. We dumped our stuff and off we went into the fray that is new York. 
The following morning whilst getting ready my wife had the lamp on as the room is pretty dark, she plugged her hair dryer in and all the power in our room went out! This happened 3 out of the 5 mornings we spent there, the staff were very apologetic and gave us complimentary breakfast (good job it was complimentary because it would of cost $28 each for a very sorry continental breakfast), and 2 free drinks each in the bar. One of the mornings they let us use another room to get ready and it was tiny, thank goodness we got the upgrade. 
A few other gripes about the Hudson are that the bar (as lovely ad it is) is VERY expensive, seriously $9 for a beer!!!!!! And the trendy manhattaners who drink in there are a little pretentious and annoying. 
Good things about the Hudson are great location, 5 mins walk from central park, 15 mins walk to times square, great bars (DJ Reynolds especially) and diners (diners for breakfast is a must), subway near by, the sky bar is beautiful as is the library bar and very friendly and helpful staff.

"“Nice location, unassuming hotel, small rooms...” My title really says it all. I liked this hotel, I didnt love it. The location was convenient to where we needed to be. We drove by it a few times before we realized that this was the hotel! The rooms were very clean and extremely small. Our particular room was no larger than a college dorm room. The bed literally took up the whole room. There was an equally small bathroom. Not what I like when I am staying in a hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the only reason I didn't give this Hotel less stars. 
There is no room service and in fact, the only restaurant on property was closed for renovations. NOt at all convenient when you would like a cup of coffee etc. Parking is $55.00 overnight -which is about the going rate in the city to park overnight when staying at hotels. We parked and took cabs everywhere because if you take your car out of valet, your charged every time. 
Our room was on the 5th floor facing the front of the building. Not a great idea! We were awoken all night from the sounds of car horns, sirens, people yelling(yes people yelling) and the hooves of the horses of the Hansom cabs! When we were able to fall back to sleep we were then again awoken by the voices coming from the rooms next door through the the paper thin walls!

This is not a hotel for anyone who needs light. The concept is designed like Alice in Wonderland and it is dark, with low ceilings and green lights in the hallways, and dark reception area. The breakfast costs $21.00, so go outside to a nearby cafe for eggs etc under $10.00. There is no room service or no place for coffee or tea in the evening, so again - you need to eat somewhere else.

The atmosphere was great. Quirky, great details, design chairs, really fun. I have been to the club previously and it is very fun as well.

Perfectly equipped room and bathroom, extremely comfortable bed.(All just renovated) No complaints about noise and we were street side, (live in central London so we can sleep through sirens etc)

A short walk to Central Park. Short Walk to Columbus Circuit and the subway, lots of restaurants not far away. 10 Blocks to Times Square (for the hop on hop off start point).
It's probably New Yorkers but 80% of staff were snobby, porters/bellboys more than reception (get over yourselves boys you move bags for a living).

Best hint I can give you is (put your stuff under the bed, heaps of room but just remember to get it all out.
Look, it was clean, modern, great location, reasonably priced just dont go in expecting you can meet your partner walking around, someone has to back up into the bathroom or get on the bed.

"“On the Hudson” When planning a trip to New York, my biggest concern was figuring out the accommodations. I wanted to find a hotel that wouldn’t cost me a small fortune, but I also didn’t want to stay somewhere that would be in a horrible location that would prevent us from being able to easily get to things in the city that we wanted to enjoy. And the more I looked for accommodations, the more I started to think that this combination would be impossible to find.
The day before our trip – Priceline saved the day by showing me the rate and location of The Hudson Hotel. It was significantly cheaper than any of the other hotels in Manhattan, the rooms looked nice, and the reviews were generally positive. I was still a little nervous because the price seemed low for a 3.5 star hotel, but we decided to book it and hope for the best.
Everything about our experience at The Hudson Hotel ended up being great. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a recently renovated suite at check-in and the staff were very friendly during our entire stay. I was amazed at the size of the room because I was under the impression that all hotel rooms in New York City were relatively small. We had a bedroom area with a queen size bed that was extremely comfortable and a living room with a couch, chair, refrigerator, and desk. The only thing that was small was the bathroom, but it was clean and the shower had good water pressure and hot water, which were the only things that mattered to me.
The location was perfect for us. It put us in the heart of the activity of Manhattan and we were a 5 minute walk from a subway station, 5 minutes from Central Park, and 5 minutes from Times Square. Considering that the other hotels I looked at that were located nearby cost nearly twice as much, our room (and complimentary upgrade) at The Hudson Hotel really felt like a steal. It turned one of the potential worries of my trip into a surprisingly relaxing experience.",DavidMAldridge,2012-09-01,223023,2012-09-17,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Small, but perfectly formed” We stayed at the Hudson in May 2012 for 5 nights and overall a good hotel. 
But first for the bad news, the other reviews are correct - the rooms are very very small. They are clean, modern and well appointed, but small! There isn't room to store more than one suitcase, so of like us you have two suitcases, you end up climbing over one everytime you need to get in or out of bed or the room (tricky in the middle of the night in the dark).
Now for the good news - everything else!! The hotel has a great mid-town location, 5 Avenue, Central Park, Times Square are all in easy walking distance. The bars in the hotel are great, the roof top bar is lovely, but of course all come with a New York price tag! We didn't eat in the hotel, but the menu looked good. The hotel staff were also great.

"“Good if you can get a good deal, but, watch your bags” Great location and nice ambience in the ultra hip lobby, ""library"", and lounge area. Very good front staff with lots of attention to customers at least when I was there. If you can get a good deal its worth it, but if not, well not so sure.
Rooms can be microscopic...take a full size mattress, and add about 1.5 feet to each side and you get the size of the main room; add a tiny bath and well, you get the idea. The bed, linnens and the room itself was very nicely appointed. Nice modern bath. Hallways in the upper floors are darkly appointed...lots of industrial gray/hipness.
They did screw up big time on me however. When we checked our bags and then retrieved them, they neglected to give all to back us and I didn't notice my computer being missing. After a severe panic the next day I called them, to see if they had it (after a period of real fear of theft etc...). The front desk only checked with housekeeping; only my call to the bellman got it back, well over 24 hours later. Did they not see this abandonded laptop bag in the store room?

The bathroom was very small and there was a clear glass wall between the bedroom and the bathroom so not ideal for friends sharing. In addition, the complimentary shampoo bottles were half used. The second time we were put on the 6th floor in an even smaller room; this one had no bath and it was not possible to sit on the toilet as it was too close to the wall. We also had two completely different check in procedures, the second time we were charged $300 and told it would be refunded at the end of our stay and when we asked why this has not happened the first tme, we were told that we probably just were not told about the money being taken. The first check in gave us no information on breakfast or the hotel amenities whilst at the second check in we were told about breakfast and given a card for the sky terrace. The hotel also would not store our small bags in their luggage store as they said this was reserved for airline workers whom they had a deal with.

There is no room service but restaurants in the area do deliver and clear security before being allowed up to deliver to the rooms.
I definitely felt safe there and the place is kept pretty clean with disposable cups in the rooms. Front desk staff was lovely both going in and coming out so they get points for that.

"“My go to hotel in NYC” Already a big fan of Morgans hotels I knew what to expect when I first stood at the Hudson a couple years ago. It's a trendy hotel with music playing in lobby and a really chill outdoor terrace. They serve pitchers of mixed drinks that were good (but pricey). Both bars are located on the same floor, one is a relaxing atmosphere with a pool table and library while the other is more of a nightclub. The location is great for Columbus circle and central park.

"“It's New York, the rooms are small” I stayed at the Hudson while in New York earlier this year. We got a great rate and the location was fairly convenient (it's right at the base of Central Park).
The room was smaller than my bedroom (like you can stand on either side of the bed, and that's about it, but if you're in New York, you don;t want to be hanging out in your hotel room, so it's a utility. 
The Hudson was fine and it's location made it a quick easy walk to the park and to subways. The bar and restaurant are great and the decor was nice. 
We did have a couple of glitches however. One afternoon I came back to the room and my key didn't work. I called the front desk and they said they would send help. I waited over 10 minutes, called again and they said they would send someone. Finally, a front desk person showed up, took my ID and then went to go get new keys. 
Secondly, the next day when I went to ask the concierge where I could buy my dad some authentic NY bagels, he sent me to H&H. When he told me where he was sending me, I thought I had read an article a couple of months prior about how H&H had shut down, but I figured that he's the concierge and from New York, so he should know. My instincts were bad. I was right. I walked almost two miles one way and found out that it no longer existed. 
So, if you don't need a reliable concierge, you'll be fine. Next time I'm going to try The Dream which was awesome.",Stacy M,2012-01-01,223023,2012-08-31,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

A) very small rooms, which in fairness we knew but it was really really difficult to unpack and pack cases or store them. Only just enough room to shuffle arpund the bed. And tiny bathroom if you are a larger side you will struggle. Imagine inside cabins on boat and you'll get the idea.
B) the room was alittle dusty so cleaning isn't a strong point.... AndI'm now covered in bites which I'm gonna say are bed bugs, i don't want to think abt it tho

"“Competitive, But Issues Are Clear” Fact: If you're going to NYC, you shouldn't *want* to stay in your hotel room. 
NY is a place to get out and do and see. The Hudson makes that possible by its lovely outdoor space, and offering small, dark, cramped rooms that make you want to get out as quickly as possible. 
It's in a great area, just off Columbus Circle, which makes it convenient for everything Midtown West has to offer -- the park, shopping, dining, etc. The fact of the matter is, I draw the line at bugs. Not bed bugs mind you, but lots of tiny winged bugs in my shower. 
This hotel is more like an unkempt backpacker place than a swanky upscale hotel, and it shows. Our rooms were replete with unfinished moldings, a lack of tile grout, an air conditioning unit that blew on me all night, a remote that barely worked...I could go on. I mean, it's hilarious just for the small size of it all. 170sq ft? Really? Try going to the bathroom while your partner is in the shower. Why, you can both shower at the same time. It's a miracle! 
But at a low rate for the neighborhood, it's fine. The staff, when available, are friendly... the outdoor spaces are very mellow and pretty. I mean, complain all you want, but when you're in NYC on a less than $500/nt hotel budget, what do you really expect?

"“Not impressed” This 3 1/2 - star hotel is located conveniently on 58th street of NYC, very close to Columbus station. In terms of cleanness of the room, the star rating met the expectations. The room was clean, hardfloored, smell-free. However, the size of the room was minuscule. The room was essentially a double-sized bed and nothing else; I felt very confined.
At night, it was worse because of the traffic outside and fan noise coming from other rooms. The window was extremely thin, failing to block out noise.",Paul K,2012-08-01,223023,2012-08-29,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“noisy and small” We got a very good price on the room through priceline and once we saw the grand lobby and the lovely outdoor courtyard our expectations were high. Our room was very tiny and only had a double bed so we upgraded to a larger room and ended up paying almost $300 a night which seemed high for the location and size of the room. We would have been relatively satisfied if not for the tremendously loud air conditioning unit and hammering (from somewhere in the hotel) that started at 7 am. The traffic noise was also very audible even though we were on the 16th floor.

"“Never again...” We arrived at the hotel after an 11 hour flight at 6p.m. We were welcomed by a very friendly and polite person in the front desk that told us that we should wait for 30 minutes to get our room. We did the paperwork and waited in the lobby for about 45 minutes. The time was passing and we were hungry so since our room was not ready we left and returned after 2 hours. After a long wait for the lift and a very dark passage through the hotels' dirty corridors, we were shown to a Superior Queen corner room, that was TOO small (the 2 suitcases did not fit, there is no space for you to move - one should stay on the bed when the other one is moving), the walk-in the corridor closet is open, there are no drawers, no fridge or minibar and the temperature was very very cold. We couldn't adjust the heater properly so we turned it off and slept immediately, since we were so so tired. The next day, after having a very bad sleep due to the noise level of the street, we went down to the front desk to tell them about the heating problem and to request a new room (when I made the reservation of the superior queen room, I booked the hotel's out and about package, that offered an upgrade of the room upon arrival that never happened). We were met by a rude employee, who without even checking the hotel system came up with the caramel-phrase, sorry we are fully booked. We let it pass since we were in NY for vacation and we didn't want to spoil our mood. Upon arrival the same night, the room was still cold, and there was noise all over the place (no soundproof at all!). Then we also realised that also our bed was very noisy, when trying to change sides! We could here the footsteps and the conversations on the corridors and all the open TV sets to the next rooms. At this point I started feeling sorry that our money were thrown down the drain and since I had booked the hotel due to it's bar and designer's reputation, I blamed myself for not trusting the customer reviews. And on top of that, we tried to visit the bar for 3 consecutive nights of our stay and it was closed, and the 2 times we found it open, it was playing music from 2 decades ago!!! Also closed were the patio and the terrace although the weather most of the time was hot! Thankgod, my husband did not care that much and since the location of the hotel was perfect and it was our first time in NY, we were barely inside the hotel.",paulargy74,2011-09-01,223023,2012-08-27,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Interesting hotel, but maybe too hipster for family” I actually came to stay here by accident. I booked through Priceline (where you don't know where you are staying until you book). It was a little bit of a fiasco as you don't put the number of people per room in Priceline and so only after we booked did we learn that the rooms at the Hudson are really small and for all four of us to stay we would have to pay hundreds of dollars (in addition to our Priceline fee) to get a room large enough for four. To the hotel's credit, the manager did offer to let us out of the Priceline booking if we wanted--and he was very pleasant and gracious. Lesson learned, though--don't book through Priceline. 
Pros about hotel:
*Really nice people and good service
*Good location
*Room had an ipod/iphone charger as well as an extra strip for charging things
Cons about hotel:
*The rooms are really small
*Although we stayed in a recently renovated room (and the decor was okay--a bit on the modern side), the bathroom was sort of gross. Just a shower and it was level with the bathroom floor. What I mean is no step down or up into the shower and no door--just a (kinda dirty) curtain. As a result, the entire bathroom floor got wet and slippery whenever anyone showered.
*Paint in the hallways is quite dark, giving the illusion that the walls are sort of closing in on you.
*Beds are very small--full size and a small full size at that.
All in all this hotel was fine for our stay. It ended up being as pricey as a Marriott, though, which would have probably been more for us. Being no longer hip and cool, I would rather have a queen or king bed (rather than the very small full bed at Hudson), light airy room, the option of room service, and a nice bathroom with granite counter rather than a pedestal sink and no place to put my cosmetics.

"“Lovely Phillippe Starck lobby, but no room service?” For those of us in dire need of good interior design as part of one's holiday surroundings, 
The Hudson does give you a quick fix as you first walk in and reach the reception desk. 
Their terrace, lounge bar, library and restaurant are sharp and will not dissapoint you. The design of each space is bold and the dim lights in the lobby will actually help you get over the fact that you are in Manhattan and that your room is rather small.
Service was quite welcoming and friendly at the reception and concierge, but I was disappointed when I did not get a reasonable explanation as to why the hotel does not offer room service.
The cilantro conditioner and other uber cool amenities in my room were much appreciated, but really no room service?
Also their 60 dollar (or so) breakfast buffet is outrageously priced. Loved their muesli, but give me a break. Would I go back?

"“Uber Trendy but rooms are tiny!” I'm a big New York fan and stayed here on my second visit to the city.

We made the most of the bar and enjoyed cosmos on the rooftop before we went out on a night. The rooms are absolutely tiny! We didn't spend much time in our room so this wasn't an issue, and the coolness of the hotel made up for it!

"“Small, or cosy?” This was actually the second time I stayed at this hotel, the first being about three years ago. Both times I booked through price line and, this time at least, I got quite a good deal on the room.
The hotel is located VERY close to Columbus circle and central park. You can easily walk from the subway; even with bags, it's probably only 100m (if you get the closest exit from Columbus Circle subway station of course!).
There are staff at the door and you go up an escalator to get to reception. I imagine there are elevators/lifts nearby as well for people unable to use an escalator. The staff at check in are really friendly and helpful.
You then get to your floor and there are vending machines beside a metallic table with bar stools. The first time I stayed here, there was a free PC on these tables. Not any more.
Everything said elsewhere about the rooms is pretty much spot on: they are small, the AC is loud and the bathrooms are TINY. Only the bathroom was really an issue for me though. People have mentioned struggling to sit on the toilet, but men will also have issues using the toilet standing up. It is so small you would actually almost consider going to the lobby instead of the bathroom in your room.
The room I was in didn't really have enough room in front of the toilet for the floor mat in the bathroom either. On the plus side, the shower was quite good.
The TV is actually quite good, maybe better than 90% of the hotels I've stayed in.

"“Higher Expectations!” We love the Morgans Group Hotels. We have stayed at the Delano in Miami a couple of times and the Mondrion in downtown NYC. So when I booked our annual birthday trip at the Hudson, I had no doubt that it would be worth the money. 
To begin there is noone outside to direct you , take your bags, or even hold the door. While I appreciate the Eco friendly mantra, it's not pleasant to walk into such a warm lobby. I reserved a deluxe queen room. I can't even begin to imagine what a standard room looked like. The deluxe room was so small and one could barely breathe. I paid for an upgrade. The room size was great but the bathroom wasn't the cleanest. We went to Tequilla park for a quick drink. Now, I don't mind paying for an expensive drink but this was a small cocktail for $17 bucks. After dinner and a show we wanted to grab a drink at the Sky Terrace. It was 10 pm. The hours said it closed at 1030. They wouldn't let us in bc they said they start cleaning at 10. Then why does it say you close at 1030? That's when I'd assume clean up begins.

"“Not the hotel it used to be” We had stayed at the Hudson eight years ago and had a nice stay. It was a hip and happening place, very clean and shiny. Time has not been good to the Hudson, despite their trumpeted renovation, the formerly cool lobby is now dim and dusty looking, the ivy clad walls and ceiling now look weedy and grey. 
From the, still fun, lounge on the 15th floor you can look down into the atrium and see all kinds of junk on top of green tarps that protect the glass of the lobby. This includes a full sheet of drywall which probably would have crashed through the glass into the lobby without the tarps. This made me nervous each time I passed through the lobby afterwards.
Our room smelled of cigarette smoke when we arrived and our comment to the very attentive bellman brought an ionizer to remove the smoke smell. This was supposed to take one hour to work, but when we returned from a two hour walk - you can't be in the room when the ionizer is going, so we had to leave- it was still there and it took 30 minutes to find someone who ask to have it removed. We spoke to four management staff before or trusty bellman, Ben, happened by and took action. During our forced 150 minute forced exile from our room we were never offered a complimentary drink or anything else for the inconvenience.
I really want to like the Hudson because we had good memories, but it's come down so far that I can't recommend it. It hip small room just seemed dingy and uncomfortable now. The air conditioner cycled on and off loudly all night - there was no setting for the fan to continue running when the A/C had reached temperature - and the cold air blew right onto your head in bed. 
You can't sit straight on the toilet, in fact I can't believe it meets the code for a bathroom. Our shower drain was plugged and nasty stuff came bubbling up when my wife took a shower.
All in all, not a pleasant stay made worse by poor management. Although, I have to applaud our two bellmen, Frank and Ben, who tried to make the stay as pleasant as possible.

"“what the hell...is this a dorm room?” i had just finished a few days with a business group and had a night off to spend in new york. i had heard great things about the hudson and decided to explore it on my own. i booked a standard room and noted the staff seemed simply annoyed with helping the customers. i simply took my key and went upstairs. the room was a closet. my sisters room at Columbia during undergrad was bigger. REALLY. i know that some people speak about value. i agree but seriously when a room is this small, what value are we really talking about? i had not much to really do so i dealt with it. the bed was nice and soft. i dropped down and looked around the bar. the crowd was hip but a bit young. the average age was probably 25. i looked around and was soon bored and ventured out of the hotel for other pastures.
overall, a nice decour but the rooms are small; the staff is testy and the experience was much less than ideal. i will not stay here again.",shark4rk,2012-07-01,223023,2012-08-12,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Tiny,not kid friendly” I found this hotel via Priceline. I wish I would have known the rooms would be so tiny and that I would have to pay to upgrade...I would have chosen to stay elsewhere. It was an $85 per night upgrade charge and a $25 a night rollaway bed charge to accommodate our family of 4. 
The restaurant had a Buffett, with no child prices (if you have picky children like I do,you will not want to spend $22).
It's a very modern, funky cool hotel. Awesome location. The little breakfast/sandwich shop a couple of doors down was perfect for breakfast and Starbucks and Duane Reed pharmacy all on the same street. I would stay here again if it was just my husband and I.

"“Best deal in NY by far” I've stayed in 5 different places in NY and this is the best you can get for $140 (via Priceline), which would be the price for a double room in a hostel. Room is TINY - not only small by really tiny. Since space in not a driver at a hotel for me, this place is amazing due to:
- Great location: west side, very close to the park and one block from subway and Lincoln Center
- Altough tiny, room is very well decorated (not fancy but truly modern) and has everyone you need: good tv with complete cable service, nice shower, bad and linen, iPhone docket and USB charger (never saw it in W, for instance), good air conditioner
- the library where you can have breakfast + internal garden is unbelievable pleasant
- free wifi at room (again, not commum in US, even in 4 stars and up)
- very clean and everything looks new
- nice staff so far

"“Excellent Atmosphere but tiny bed-rooms.” The hotel was gob-smackingly impressive. Wonderful decor with lots of dark wood. The hotel lobby is huge, and the Library Bar is very peaceful. The outside bar again is huge, and has a touch of the orient, with lots of comfy spaces to relax in. The Sky Terrace has wonderful views of the city and of the Hudson River, but sometimes it can be difficult to find somewhere to sit. The hotel stafff, especially the bellboys, are friendly and very helpful. The location of the hotel would be hard to beat, it's very close to Central Park, to Times Square, and to the theatres on Broadway. The disappointing bit though, is the size of the rooms, which are very small, and also the lack of wardrobe and shelf space.

"“Wonderful ambiance” Boutique hotel with a wonderful ambiance. You are first met with a rather large open lobby covered in ivy that makes you say ""whoa"" and you know off the bat that this is a boutique hotel. Wonderful courtyard directly behind the front desk that is very shaded and a great spot to relax if your room isn't ready. Rooms are a tad on the small side but a great aesthetic with the dark wood walls, blinds and floors and crisp white linens. Bedside lamps are really neat along with an ipod dock or phone charger. Be mindful the bathroom is tiny but you'll live. The Sky Terrace has a wonderful city and Hudson River view with plenty of lounge chairs and greenery. I will say the Sky Terrace bar let me down completely in serving 2 warm Mimosas, I mean really not to professional in the least, plus $36. My fault for getting to the room and not returning back to have them change it out. All in all a very positive hotel other than the bar issue. Location is wonderful, one block from Columbus Circle and Central Park South.

"“Good to sleep in, thats it.” I know it was meant o be a small room, but c'mone on! The room was mini. The bed was comfortable. They should really have switched the toilet and sink. It sucked that I could touch the wall with my head and my husband felt awkward not being able to ""fit"" on the toilet seat since he's so tall. 
The whole place smelled weird too! I couldnt figure out if it was the carpet or walls...that bothered me too.
If your not going to be in your hotel very long and are going to need it to just sleep in every night, this hotel is bearable. Don't expect a friendly staff or even a spa type deal, you sleep there only.
I think they had a club but made men dress up and didnt care if women dressed down, that was dumb.

"“Great Hotel to lay your head in a busy NYC” My husband and I stayed at the Hudson for the first 4 nights of our honeymoon in July. We knew the rooms would be small but they were smaller than expected! We had to change rooms after the first night as the toilet was blocked despite being fixed whilst we were out. The staff were great and accommodating of this and offered to move us from 8th floor to 23rd. We were so pleased as 8th floor was fairly loud from the air conditioning units, however our room at the top was quiet and had an amazing view of the Hudson river. It was just a shame they had not given this in the first instance as we were on honeymoon. 
It is a great location very close to Central Park and Times Square and easy to walk or get taxis to see the sights of NYC. We would stay here again as it is in such a fab location. 
Staff at the hotel were helpful, especially Daniel in Concierge. The hotel is very modern in style and has quirky furniture and lighting with a nice relaxing roof terrace for a romantic drink.

"“It's a Good Hotel!” People keep going on about the size of the rooms, yes there are small but they are very nice and clean. Besides, how long do you really stay in the room. The small rooms have an added advantage - the A/C the rooms are the prefect temperature!
The staff are very helpful, the girl at the reception (Erica, I think) had lots of patients with my grumpy face after the 4hours in the airport, 7 hour flight and 2 hours in customs.
If I were to describe this hotel in one word I use 'Cool!'.
When I was there I only visited the bar once, it was very nice and chilled. But 9th Ave has all the night life you need, loads of great bars and restaurants!
So to sum up - the rooms are small but very nice, the staff are helpful.

Very very clean and reasonably quiet as well - certainly so, if you get a high floor. Great skydeck on 15th floor. Staff was nice and upbeat quite consistently. Effective A/C in the room for August temperatures. Only complaint was that the WiFi signal within the room was of barely adequate quality, and perhaps the lack of a comfortable chair to relax in. There is a desk chair and a small desk, adequate for working. Need to single out Devin at the front desk for being especially attentive and helpful! Ask for him if you can.

"“A flop house with a fancy foyer” I really hated this hotel for all the reasons a lot of other people probably like it. The public areas are flamboyant, atmospheric and interesting (although the colors of the street level entry are absolutely revolting) and there's a kind of alcohol-fueled social energy circulating through the foyer, restaurant and terrace. I don't drink so most of this is lost on me. I've stayed in a fair share of trendy boutique hotels and they all use violent colors, eccentric design elements and unorthodox features that masquerade as hip but cover over a kind of underlying synthetic cheapness. The rooms are microscopic and slightly weird. I will admit that the beds, which were set low, were very comfortable, so no complaints there. But the hallways! The hallways! The ugly brown walls reminded me of a tenement in Serpico. I expected to see Al Pacino staggering around the corner with a gunshot in the face. Very depressing. The breakfast was cute and madly overpriced and they reserved all the best tables for ""the press"" - really?. The hotel staff were not very helpful. But the last straw for me was my room passkey never worked. After about 5 trips to reception to have the card re-charged without success, I blew a gasket and let the manager have it. They were nice enough to give my business partner a couple of free nights stay as I was checking out of my room but I would never, ever go back to that place. Life is too short.

Has seating to chill, work on laptop, etc. A very comfortable, well decorated hotel. Aesthetics matter. The sky terrace is perfectly cozy, with hammock, overlooking city. Such interesting layout and just cute. My fav was the park terrace on same floor as lobby, they have taco hour, no veggie tacos though, so I didn't indulge. The location of the hotel is so wonderful.

I was in NYC on a work trip and the location of the hotel was perfect. Literally steps away from Central Park and Columbus Circle and best of all it is so close to one of NYC's best connected subways making it incredibly easy to get around!
The hotel is dark, yes but if you're a twenty something like for an amazing base to explore New York from then you could do a lot worse than The Hudson! The roof terrace has incredible views and the outdoor areas are refreshing after a hard day in the city!
I requested a refurbished room and all of my needs were catered to. I had a Queen size bedroom and had absolutely no problem with the size. It was clean, very comfortable and also quiet - I got a lot of sleep here!

"“Nice hotel in need of Improvement” We stayed one Saturday night at the Hudson I heard all about the small rooms and noise this is true. Yes our room was small but was clean , A/C and TV worked fine. The decore was trendy but dated the green hallway doors a bit ugly for our taste. The public areas like the courtyard at the lobby level was cluttered with candle holders and such and big bulky furniture right out of the Hobbit. Nice area but good be great one, another problem was the empty bottles and glasses and lack of trash containers in public areas. The 15th floor skyveiw is nice and also shares the fate of the courtyard to many candle lanterns plants and chairs which really hinders getting a veiw. The skyveiw is a twenty something hangout from Thursday thru Saturday night and many non Hotel residents romming the Hotel for the three bars on these nights.
The price of drinks is crazy beer for 9.00 and shangria for 14.90 yes overpriced. Don't get the breakfast package a complete waste of money go down the block and breakfast on the corner of ninth ave. The selection was so bad 4 fruit choices Greek yogart? yes and crusty rolls under a hot lamp. If you want eggs or something cost you extra.

"“Great location in NYC” My stay at the Hudson was booked by the organizers of the event that I attended. They had warned us that the rooms are small and so they were. I was on the 8th floor and it offered a great view. The best about this hotel is, of course, the location - very near Columbus circle and Central park. It is also within walking distance of Times Square and some other landmarks. Linciln Center, which is nearby, is also worth visiting.
Apart from the small room, there is not much to complain about - the room was cleaned every day, towels were also changed every day but I didn't spend much time in the room. After all, I was in NYC!
One thing I didn't like was that the bed made a funy noise every time I turned and also the air conditioner was a bit noisy.",Mir929,2012-06-01,223023,2012-07-17,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The Hotel is Chic and Modern, Clean and beautifully decorated!

"“Happy At The Hudson 😊” I've stayed at several Morgans properties, and I'm always impressed with the decor, and the staff is always ready and eager to make my stay personal and memorable. The Hudson Hotel is perfectly located, has a GREAT 15th floor patio bar, intimate library bar, and like the Sky Bar at the Mondrian in Los Angeles the Hudson Bar is a chic and popular destination for locals looking to have a great night out in the town.

I would stay there every weekend ... I am simply in love with that gorgeous Hudson.",Ingeborg F,2012-07-01,223023,2012-07-14,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“What's happened?” Really disappointed with my second visit to the Hudson. I had previously stayed here in 2009 and found very little to fault. Yes, the rooms were small - but for me, they were perfectly formed. Add to this some great styling, good service and perfect location I was eager to return.
Unfortunately, upon my return visit last week (from 6 July) I found my stay to be rather less impressive. After a long (and unapologetic) wait to check in, I found my 'Standard Queen' room to verging on the 'tatty' side. First things first; the door lock involved much effort to open/close and was clearly in need of repair. The bathroom was also in a decidedly poor shape with flaking paint, mould on the window and the toilet roll holder falling off the wall.
Inside the main bedroom, the tattyness continued, with a large piece of the wooden wall panelling missing from beside the air conditioning unit. The iPod dock beside the bed was also not working and the TV apparently not working either.
My room was right next to the roof terrace bar, which is a lovely spot. Less lovely were the hotel staff who kept rudely telling me the bar was closed when I was merely trying to get back to my room. Also, if the bar wants to charge $15 for a cocktail, at least employ some decent barmen who know how to mix them.
All in all, a rather noticeable dip in quality from this once fine hotel.
I know the hotel is in the process of being renovated, and the floor (15) that I was on hadn't been done yet - but it seems unfair to charge customers for a room that is clearly in need of said renovation.
There is/was much to still recommend about the Hudson, but it certainly seems to be trading on former glories at the moment. There are far better hotels in Manhattan (for the same or less) offering a far higher standard of accomodation.

"“Clean and Cramped” Aside from the lovely roof terraces on the 15th and lobby floors, the hotel room was a bit cramped. Fine for one night, but the room was made for a tiny person - and I'm 5'3! The bathroom was so small that while I sat on the toilet, my knees touched the wall. When I bent over the sink to wash my face, I was hitting the door behind me. The bed was very comfortable, however the air conditioner directly behind the headboard was noisy. Needless to say, I turned off the A/C so I could get some sleep. I stayed on the 8th floor in a ""newly renovated"" room. It was very hip, clean and just enough room, but I felt like I was in my walk-in closet at home.

"“Great Location Near Central Park” Thanks to the other traveler's reviews of the Hudson, I had a good idea of what to expect. Since I got a great rate on Priceline I called ahead & asked for a larger room and paid for the upgrade. Thankfully, a room was available during the busy weekend. The reception desk & lobby area is dark and funky, one gets the idea that you are in some secret club as there are NO signs outside or in the lobby letting you know the name of the place. The front desk staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly! Having forgotten my iphone charger they happily plugged it into their computer every night. I wish I had more time for the Sun terrace on the 15th floor during the day, as it was a delightful oasis with a great view of the Hudson river.
With Whole Foods, Columbus Circle, Central Park, the subway, bike rentals & lots of eateries within a block of this place, I was a very happy traveler!",spankyangel,2012-07-01,223023,2012-07-12,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“It's alright” Staying here wasn't really our choice, but was a necessity in a wider holiday context. First of all, the staff were terrific. Very friendly, very chatty, great in general. 
However, the hotel itself was different. For a four star, you expect certain basics, decent room size, decent decor, lights that are able to be turned off easily and so on. None of those bare minimums were present. The rooms were quite small, not so minuscule as one would expect reading some other reviews here, but small all the same. Probably, in the bulk of the room, about 8foot by 12 foot. Not terribly cramped, but you wouldn't want to be claustrophobic. The decor was...minimalist. Bare lick of white paint on the walls, with occasional bursts of extravagant colour, in lamps that I couldn't turn off.

The interior is not light well - but that is 'part of the experience'!! the rooms are (well, the one we had with 2 x double beds) was minimalistic, clean lines and all amenities were excellent. 
The real high light was our visit to the Terrace Bar on 15th floor after dark. 
It was a magic time. No 'bar stools and counter' here......there were trees in huge pots lit with decorative lights, wisteria covered pergola and each area for customers was private and there were loungers, hammocks and huge cushions to sit on. We looked down Madisson Ave., and broadway and right out to the river. The whole of NYC at our feet and we were far from the madding crowd as it were.
Although we felt like Ma & Pa kettle the staff were good to us as we goggled at the Y & B people swanning past us as we lay on our loungers sipping Cognac Sours!!. .
Definitely not a hotel for an 'over night stop' it is a place to loose yourself in and 'go with the flow'........a hotle I will always remember.",pippa64Oamaru,2012-06-01,223023,2012-07-09,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Nice hotel in NYC” I was at this hotel w/ 3 other girlfriends on a whirlwind trip. It was our 1st time here & we came in during the heatwave that NYC was having at that time. The hotel made our stay nice & bearable. Every1 was nice- from the front desk ladies to the bellhops. The lobby is on the 2nd floor. You can see a photo of the lobby w/a ivy covered glass roof in the professional photos provided here. It was nice. We didn't get to go to their restaurant but hopefully next time we will. We had a double double room and it suited our needs. I liked the hard wood floors and solid white bathroom. Loved the bowl sink but the common pull handle toilet-not so much. When we were checking out, the front desk associate encouraged us to visit the rooftop terrace. It was nice and had an ok view. No big sights to see from there. There's some places to eat in the area, there's a CVS on the adjacent corner, and Columbus Circle is just around the corner. 
The only issues was that the hallways were dreary & humid. They need a brighter color of paint on the walls as gray made it dreary and drab looking. There is some renovations going on currently. You will know with all of the scaffolding on the outside of the building. The hotel name is not too visible- there's only 'H's on some of the scaffolding banners. We didn't hear any construction noises from our room thankfully.

"“Beautiful Hotel!” When I got to the Hudson I was immediately in awe from how beautiful this hotel was. The lobby was very nice. I got in pretty late, around 11:45 pm so check-in was a breeze for me. The lady that helped check me in was very friendly and extremely helpful. The cool thing about The Hudson is that they also have a club inside so if you're ever bored you can go down have a drink and listen to some music. I also enjoyed the fact that because I travelled by myself I didnt have to stay in my hotel room the entire time after coming from a walk in the city, I could simply go to the bar for a drink and head outside to their beautiful outside patio. The staff at the hotel were extemely helpful as well. My room was small but for a small girl it was perfect, the bathroom was pretty tiny though. I'd go back to The Hudson in a flash.

"“Rooms are too small even for NYC...” I've lived in NYC in the past and now travel to NYC frequently so I understand that space is a premium in the big apple and hotel rooms can be especially small, but honestly this was one of the smallest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in, so i was thankful it was for only one night. 
The pro's of the hotel are that the lobby area was very comfortable with plenty of space, the garden terrace a peaceful area to relax with a pre-dinner cocktail, I saw some people playing pool in the billiards room which was a nice feature. I will also say that the rooms were modern, clean and well decorated and certainly made use of every inch of space that they could. 
The con's were that the check-in process was so slow, people were lined up in the lobby with only 2 people working at this enormous front desk area. The elevator situation was even slower, be prepared to stand and wait and then jockey for a position on the elevation like you do in the subway. And then the rooms... especially the bathroom, as I said were too small even for NYC standards. I am 5'8"" and when I sat on the toilet, my knees were literally hitting the wall. My boyfriend who is 6'5"" would not have even fit in the room, never mind been able to use the bathroom. 
So although I liked the vibe of the Hudson, I felt like I was in a prison cell when I got to my room and therefore I don't think I would stay here again.",demodiva,2012-06-01,223023,2012-07-09,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Shoe Box Size, but great location and amenities” Plus: The hotel is very euro boutique, incredible location, and very cool courtyard patio area, rooftop bar, and bar club on first floor.

I don't think we could walk around the room without one having to lay on the bed...lol. The queen bed was the size of the room.

"“Worst hotel experience ever!” My husband and I checked in with our two boys on July 1- July 5. I had booked through Priceline several months in advance and contacted the hotel DIRECTLY after receiving confirmation through Priceline to request a double room and was assured that my room would have two double beds. The representative offered a room view of the Hudson River at no additional cost, which I gladly accepted. Upon arrival at 12:30am, the front desk clerk informed me that because I had booked with Priceline, she would not be able to give me a double rooms with a view of the river because the price I paid was below cost for those rooms. After a long days travel with two 6' boys and a hubby in tow, I asked if she could just provide a room with double beds as I was promised. She declined with no explaination gave me a key and walked away. I contacted the Hudson's reservations by phone and was told that the hotel declined to accommodate us with the previous request due to lack of availability, but when I returned to the desk clerk 30 mins later I was offered a double room for an additional cost of $75/night. I was in no condition to argue or bargain at 1:00am. I needed rest, so I asked the desk clerk to give me the room number. She walked down to the next desk clerk and whispered in her ear with a smirk on her face, then returned with a key for room 1121 (the smallest and nosiest room in the entire hotel). My family of 4 scurried down the dark dingy halls to find that we were given a closet with a designer futon bed which is only 1 foot off the floor and a foot of space on each side of the walls (no room for 4 people and luggage). I called the front desk again and requested management. I was told that the room that we had originally requested was available, but for $150/night. She proceeded to explain that the hotel's reservations line could not reserve a room for guests by phone, guests can only request rooms once they arrive. ""What?"" I explained that I was quoted a price of $75/night at the front desk. She stated that the previous young lady was new and did not give and accurate quote. I contacted reservations again and the representative attempted to request a double bed for us because she stated that the room we were given could not accommodate 4 people. The front desk clerk stated that although rooms with double beds were available, she would not move us unless we paid $150 upcharge. The money was not a factor at this point. We did not know what to believe and I have never had such rude service at a hotel. My husband decided not to pay the additional cost because we didn't want to be upgraded to a room with two doubles without a toilet. We were sick of being lied to over and over. The hotel renovations and constant banging at 7am were annoying and difficult to sleep through. I spoke with the hotel's manager upon check-out. I was offered an upgrade at another one of their hotels in the future and given an apology for not receiving accomodations for a party of four, when there were double rooms available all over the hotel as well as ajoining rooms which she should have provided for us. The location is great because you are just across from Central Park and on a quiet street in Columbus Circle. The lobby and library areas are nice. My husband and I stayed at the Dream Hotel and found that this location is more convenient for sightseeing and traveling around the city. The elevator waits were long and we missed our restaurant reservations downtown due to peek hour traffic in the hotel. No pictures available because we didn't have elbow room to snap them.

“The hotel for the ongoing party atmosphere” I stayed with my niece who is 17 at this hotel on June-July 2012 for 10 days on a corner suite. The design of the room was very modern and comfy.

"“Aircon problem” There is a lot to recommend this hotel, the location close to the south end of Central Park was excellent and the design of the reception, the terrace, the bar and even breakfast area was really clever and engaging. The room was small but attractive and functional.
The bad: The air conditioning, this emanates from behind the head board of the bed with the sound of a jet engine. We were there when it was very hot and at night the room would warm up until it reached the set level after which the room would be blasted with cold air, the range in temperature was really too large to comfortably sleep",toivope,2012-07-01,223023,2012-07-07,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great visuals, poor design” Pro: This hotel photographs beautifully, and as a backdrop for a fashion shoot or film premiere (which was taking place on our first night) you can't beat it. The location just by Columbus Circle is excellent for shopping and Central Park. The winter garden is an oasis (though closed for a couple of days when we were there). The staff were mostly amazing- great restaurant recommendations (eat at Blue Ribbon if you arrive late)- though the very friendly bellboys were nowhere to be found when we arrived with a pile of bags in the middle of a chaotic red-carpet film opening.
Con: The rooms are unbelievably small and noisy. There was barely a foot of clearance around the bed and inadequate space for suitcases. (We could have had them stored, but not worth the hassle for 2 nights.) The 19th floor corner room was inadequately insulated against traffic noise. No ventilation in the bathroom. Not even drinking glasses (paper cups were provided in the bathroom, and the receptionist managed to find some plastic ones.) A fridge but no mini-bar: we were directed to the vending machines, full of iced tea etc. or to a local 24 hour CVS. I'm sure the bellboys would have sourced anything we needed, but it wasn't convenient.

"“Trendy decor but a few issues” The good: A trendy and funky hotel which makes for a fun experience. Interesting decor, gorgeous sky terrace bar and a trendy in house restaurant that is self-serve tapas style (perfect for a quick snack before an late dinner reservation). Good location and friendly staff.
The bad: Incredibly long elevator waits. Long and dark hallways. Hotel key card issues. We struggled to get into our room each time. Luckily we only stayed one night and needed access only 3 times. When we first arrived we actually went back to the front desk because we thought our keys were coded for the wrong room. When given new keys, we still couldn't get in but housekeeping walking by was able to get it to work after a few tries. When calling the front desk we were told an engineer would come to look at it, but we never saw anyone and getting into the room never got easier. Rooms are small, but thats to be expected in Manhattan.

"“Super cool hotel.” Myself & my fiancé stayed here on a romantic city break in March. I love 'Morgan' hotels with their funky decor & trendy clientelle. The Hudson is no exception.
You could easily walk past the hotel, as the entrance is pretty low key, but once inside you take a cool elevator up to the 1st floor reception, with it's low lighting & chilled out background music.
You are greeted with a warm welcome & a glass of champagne in our case as the room wasn't quite ready.
The rooms like many other reports are small, very small. The reason why I don't score this hotel a 5, but as we are out most of the time, it's not a mega hardship.
The hotel has two super cool bars, one with an outside courtyard & a dj playing chilled out dance music. The berry capprinha's are superb!

"“Perfect location, but ridiculously small and uncomfortable rooms” Recently stayed 4 nights at the Hudson and let me first say that the hotel has a perfect location and the reception, concierge and security staff were all extremely friendly and helpful - although they seem to be under-staffed at times.
We had a standard queen room which was clean, however, the rooms and bathrooms are so ridiculously small (even for NY standards) that it's impossible to open your suitcase. Especially the bathroom was a challenge and very uncomfortable. Being hoteliers ourselves we have traveled extensively to many other capital cities, but we have never seen any rooms as small as these... We had a quiet room on the 12th floor facing the courtyard, but be aware that the music from the bar downstairs will disturb you if you stay on the lower floors (which currently seem to be under renovation).
The room we stayed in was in need of some renovation too. The shower head was half broken, air conditioning making noise, some of the electrical plugs were not working so we could only charge one phone at the time, and the in-room safe was not working and could not be repaired during our stay so we had to carry our valuables along at all times. The hotel's public areas, elevators and rooms are extremely dark for my taste, so it's difficult to read any information.
Even though you don't spend much time in a New York hotel room and the location of the hotel is excellent, we won't return to the Hudson and recommend you to stay elsewhere if you're looking for a little comfort in the room.",Tulipana77,2012-05-01,223023,2012-07-04,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Exceptional service” Tried my luck and won on a Priceline bet… bargain shot at a Manhattan room - ended up with the Hudson, super cheap. In the past we enjoyed the club and lounge in the Hudson's sister hotel, the Mondrian in Soho. That hotel was fun, so we looked forward to our Hudson stay. Having read some of the reviews about the Hudson, I had slight reservations with smallish rooms. We've stayed at The Pod on 51st Street a few years ago (paid double than this Priceline deal). So we've experienced ""boutique"" refurb hotels in the past. To compare, in the past year, we've stayed at the Andaz (5th Ave), Marriott (Times Sq), and Dream (Downtown). The first two are ""thumbs up"". The Grand Hyatt has been nice in the past too. 
As we kicked off a milestone anniversary year, the staff delighted us with not one upgrade but two. Guest relations moved us up from a standard room with a full sized bed to a renovated queen room. Then, for the last half of our stay, the front desk moved us to a suite on the top floor. What a bonus! 
The standard queen room is small, but adequate… aside from having enough bedspace (wink-wink), who needs much space whilst in NYC??? My lady and I were out and about most of time any way. 
The suite was a good size for NYC. The room was on the 23rd floor and had very good views. With a tub, the bathroom was slightly bigger than the standard room. In both rooms, the compact bathrooms were a miss. 
Also, the room decor is indeed a little on the dark side but the hardwood floors were a nice welcome - cleaner than carpet. The rooms were quite clean and the beds very comfy. The bed in the suite was (thankfully) firmer than in the standard room.
We were so busy enjoying other hotspots in town that we missed trying the food or drinks on the terrace. That was a shame. Though a few (incl. Renzo, our usual driver) have told us they enjoyed the lounge and terrace at the Hudson before. 
As mentioned in many of the previous reviews, the location is excellent. There is so much to do and see nearby. A Hudson guest could have an extensive NYC visit without taxi nor transit. 
Exceptional was the service. From the a pre-stay queries, check-in thru check-out, staff were extremely friendly, engaging, and helpful. Email communication was excellent. The doormen, bellmen were very good. Housekeeping was friendly.

"“An Oasis in the busy City!” Just arrived home after an 8 day stay at the Hudson -- it's the Best! Our visit started with a wonderful welcome from Zander in the lobby....and what a beautiful lobby it is! Huge chandelier, high glass ceiling and a beautiful arched window overlooking the atrium/park. It's a great oasis to relax and slow down during the day and have a nice quiet drink in the evening. Another favorite place was the 15th floor terrace -- it's fabulous! -- our camera is full of pics of city views from this comfy area. Terrific lounges and sofas,...bring your book after picture-taking and enoy the ""quiet"" after a busy day! Thanks to Casey and Jamal on the terrace for friendly, great service. We were in a studio and it was everythng we could ever want....comfortable bed...huge flat-screen tv....sofa...desk.....refrigerator and a large, large closet. We loved the decoratlng in our room and throughout the entire hotel..be sure to check out the library. There's absolutely nothng negative to say about this hotel....we won't stay anywhere else on our trips to New York!

"“Bit too dark and urbane for its own good... Not for kids.” We travel at Easter with two kids on a working holiday, so our choice was limited to which hotel would have a second child in out room and not charge us for two rooms or a suite. 
We booked a large double double or five nights, but when we got there I realised that it was un-refurbished upper floors, the lower floors being refurbished at the moment. It was really, really, small and the balcony was locked, until we insisted it be opened to get some space.
After two nights, having realised there were refurbished rooms lower down the building, I requested a transfer and they very graciously arrange this. From then on out experience improved and the decor and size of the new large double double was lovely.
The staff on Reception and House Keeping were excellent, but the queues are long. We arrive late at night from London and there was no one at the bottom of the escalator to great us with two kids and four suitcases. We could have done with knowing where to find the lift to Reception.
The restaurant is very,very dark, breakfast as expensive and and worth avoiding - eat elsewhere - and the bright sunny courtyard was locked owing to renovation, which was a bit of a shame with two kids. The place is very dark and urbane, which is not ideal for kids, but Central Park is just one the road.

"“Can a Room Be Any Smaller?” The Hudson is modern, hip (if hip means the light level in the lobby is batcave dark), and very well located (1/2 block from Columbus Circle). The room was very clean and had everything one needs, but could it have been any smaller? There was a queen bed and about a foot on either side to move around. I am tall but not big around and I could barely manage in the bathroom, with my needs pushed up against the wall when sitting on the toilet-no joke! The fitness room is excellent and the outdoor sitting area off the lobby is really nice. The free wifi in the room was excellent!

"“Contacted them in advance” After reading the mixed reviews about this hotel and seeing how actively they respond (although often not in any meaningful way) to both positive and negative reviews, I decided to email in advance of my arrival.
I was told I'd been put into a refurbished room and indeed it did look like it had been just recently refurbished. Yes the room is small and it's really 'filled' with the large bed but then I don't use hotels rooms for much more than sleeping in anyway so no complaints there.
Lighting - always a complaint of mine...why can't there be a primary room light, why (in almost every hotel I go to for that matter) do I have to go and switch 10 different lamps and reading lights and desk lamps on to just get enough light to see myself in a mirror! Mood lighting is great but please give me the choice of also having a primary preferably ceiling mounted light that gives me a decent level of room illumination.
AC - Well the AC here is a disaster, very very noisy, wrong location (right behind your headboard of the bed, so sleeping with it on is near impossible...in fact I didn't even try because even while I was working in my room it was unbearably noisy. Doesn't matter if it's high, med, low or eco mode it's just outright noisy!
I complained and was offered a free breakfast, nice gesture but did solve my problem with the noise. 
Bathrooms - be warned they are small...if you are on the larger side, be warned you seriously could get stuck in there! you certainly won't find it comfortable.
The roof bar staff were seriously up their own behinds and after making me wait 20mins to get a drink (they explained they only had one barman...clearly no unemployed bar- folk in NYC!) they then promptly called last orders at 10pm and closed shortly thereafter! what??!? A bar that closes at 10pm?!? hello!
Food was good, above average, stupid self-service restaurant, trying way to hard to be trendy!
I've stayed in other hotels within this group in London and San Francisco, they were all better than the Hudson. It's ok though so don't be too put off, just know what you are going to get.

"“every great except the room” The atmosphere of the hotel was great with really unique only-in-New York decorations.
The hotel had a in-house lounge accessible for free for guests, but was worthwile enough for non-guests to pay cover to attend. There was also a out-door rooftop on the 15th floor that I would recommend visiting when staying at the Hudson. Great atmosphere in a congested city with a even better view.
Overall very clean enviroment inside the hotel, even though the exterior was under construction during our stay. 
The biggest problem was the room size, the rooms are extremely small, but that is something expected when renting from a renovated NYC building.
Great location in a upscale area of Manhattan, very safe and fashionable stores near by.
I would definitely recommend staying at the hotel and using the additional facilities, but would not recommend the hotel if you plan on staying in your room for the bulk of the trip.

"“Sometimes size matters” Our first impression of the Hudson, upon arriving in their 3rd floor lobby, was, ""Well, this is...dark."". FYI, the lobby has perhaps the lowest level of lighting of any we've experienced. It's quite unique, as you're in a huge ivied arbor. But it is dark!
We paid scant attention to some reviews critical of the size of the rooms. It turns out they were justified. For the record, our room at the Hudson was the smallest we have experienced anywhere. Numbers 2 through 5 would be Amsterdam, Barcelona, Paris and Hong Kong. This one was so small there was only room for a double bed and no dresser. Kinda gives meaning to the term, ""living out of a suitcase"". And if you're a little on the large size, the bathroom may prove a challenge. Fitted with a shower only, but well stocked with personal sized shampoo, conditioner, etc.
But...the room was air conditioned and you can open the window a bit to breathe in that fresh New York air if you so choose. The room was cleaned to spotless daily and also had an in-room safe - something we always appreciate.
We tried none of the amenities, so have no comment there.

"“We loved this place!” Everyone was very nice and accommodating; from Avalon who checked us in and managed to find me a double double early so that we could get settled in before heading out to our show, to Rafael who brought up our bags and who never forgot my name and was friendly every time he saw us, to ""Puck"" who's real name I never caught but who was an absolute delight at the door. (He had an energy and metropolitan flair that I loved, and his platinum blonde hair and iridescent visage in the 100+ degrees just made me think of whimsical Puck from Shakespeare's ""Midsummer Night's Dream.)
The entire hotel exudes ambience and has an almost grotto-like vibe. Our room was small yes, but the spartan decor- which I loved - made it a non-issue. The linens were like buttah and I've never slept so soundly in a strange bed in my life. 
I suppose if I had to name one thing I would have liked better, it would've been perhaps improvements to the bathroom which wasn't really ""bad"" it was just small. I would add a hand-held showerhead since there's not much space in the shower itself, and I would add longer shower curtains so that the water doesn't get out into the room itself.
All in all it was a lovely, whirlwind visit for me and my girls into the City and we laughed and enjoyed ourselves the entire time.

"“Pretty good for the price” The Hudson is located in a convenient and very pleasant neighborhood - it's super-close to Columbus Circle station and Central Park. It was also astonishingly quiet for a hotel (or any structure in NY, for that matter). There was barely any ambient noise in the room at all. 
First, the pluses: The room was neat as a pin, the bed and pillows were comfy, the wi-fi worked, and the design was so sleek that you could almost totally overlook how teensy the space actually was. Fancy-pants toiletries by Malin + Goetz were a nice touch. The hotel also boasts multiple bars which are all ridiculously atmospheric, if extremely expensive.
Now, the minuses: It's hard to avoid the feeling that you're in a glorified dorm for international trend-yuppies. While everything is meticulously designed, the rooms are very small and the hallways are badly ventilated. (I could smell every stinky foot and every dump anyone took as I walked past. Pretty gross, if fleetingly so.) The gym was in a basement space that was pretty meh, and there was no swimming pool. Which, for a place as design-y and plush as this, seems like an oversight. I also found myself wishing there was a coffee machine in the room, or at least room service. 
On balance, though, the hotel is very nice and swank even if it's kind of more style than substance.

Cramped quarters aside, the location was pretty convenient for what I needed to do & see. The staff were quite helpful as well. The valets who stored & retrieved our bags were the best.

"“Old Man River” A night at the Hudson is as close as one gets to sleeping in a refrigerated shipping container - without the benefit of the international travel. Even for New York hotel rooms these are comically small - you don't so much use the bathroom as wear it in the morning. The air conditioning unit, inches from my head, sounds like it was built by Harley Davison. And if you want a drink of any kind, your mini bar has been helpfully replaced with a vending station down the hall. A short walk in theory, but somehow longer in your PJs. The service at the front desk was casually indifferent to our twenty minute wait to check in, and the once achingly cool decor looks tired - much like you'll feel after riding the air con all night.

"“Don't listen to the bad reviews!” I booked this hotel last year for my disabled mum and her two cousins. I have contacted the hotel a number of times to ensure that she had a suitable room. Each time, staff replied quickly.
They had a wonderful time and described the hotel as amazing. They had one of the new rooms and could not fault it at all.
Lots of people have described the rooms as small - this is new York and if you want a bigger room you will need to pay more!
, I do genuinely believe that the hotel has listened to comments from previous guests and taken criticism on board. Once all of the hotel has been updated it will be amongst the best in new York. I have been a frequent traveller to the big apple and I always stay in the iconic 5 star hotels but when I go next I will certainly give the Hudson a try.",Tashasidorowicz,2012-06-01,223023,2012-06-10,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Size does matter...sometimes.” I recently stayed at the Hudson Hotel in New York. My first impression from the lobby of the hotel was a chic trendy hotel, but when I got to my room I felt a bit like the giant Alice in Wonderland. I travel to New York often, and this by far was the tiniest room I have ever stayed in. For example, when using the toilet, my knees hit the wall, and I am not unusually tall (5'9""). My bed was a queen, which had about 4-6 inches on either side. The room was, for lack of a better word, a shoebox. The room was also quite loud and I could hear noise from my neighbors and the hallway. I do compliment the hotel for using the vertical space in the room- however, there wasn't much vertical space to use. I recommend just visiting the Library Bar or the Atrium and skipping a stay here. You can find better rooms for your money.",cjc04,2012-06-01,223023,2012-06-09,False,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“So much to love and a few things to dislike” I almost hate to give an ""average"" overall rating because there were so many thing I loved about this hotel. The staff is wonderful. So friendly. So responsive. Alex welcomed me upon check in and explained the various bars, restaurants, etc. and the neighborhood. I felt welcome and happy to be there. In addition the library bar, the night club, and especially the Sky Terrace are all wonderful and provide such a nice variety of venues for different people and moods. Hands down my favorite time spent at the hotel was relaxing on the sky terrace. What a unique spot in NYC! Outside on the 15th floor, there are many plants, comfortable oversized couches, chairs, lounge chairs, even a hammock. The staff there was friendly, helpful, and accommodating. When I had problems (see below), Olivia, a manager whom my friend spoke to, and Zander were all responsive and kind. The lobby is gorgeous and the location (near Columbus Circle and Central Park, right on the #1 train) is ideal. 
The downside? The rooms are incredibly small. I realize all NY hotel rooms are relatively small and one has to adjust their expectations, but for the price it was disappointing. The space between the wall and the toilet was uncomfortable and would not be accessible for many. On the second morning, my friend woke up with a couple of bites which she suspected might have been bed bugs. She called and management agreed to upgrade us, which they did to a much larger room (with a sofa and much bigger bathroom and closet area). That room was lovely and I appreciated their responsiveness to the issue. We did not get any more bites while we were there thank goodness. My only other complaint was that the wireless internet was horrible. I could not access my e-mail for most of the weekend. When I called their tech support, she suggested I go sit by the door where the signal was stronger. When that didn't work, I never got a call back.

At night, the trendy wood louvers don't block out the ambient light, so it was hard to sleep.

"“Thank goodness it was only one night.” I have been here dozens of times for the bars. They used to be very cool. Didnt check them out this time as i was only in town for one day for the Rangers game 5 against Ottowa... the one they tied with 6 seconds left and won in OT.... so i was in a great mood. Alas, that was not enough to make a room at this hotel seem fit for humans. It was the smallest room i have ever been in in my entire life. Lots of europe travel during college here, hostels and mini hotels and the likes (15 countries so i am no faker). This room was seriously 7x7 and the bathroom maybe 2.5x4. I am 5""10' 160 pounds and i felt like the walls were closing in on me even lying on the bed. They say it is a double room but no way on earth more than 1 person could be in the regular room at the same time. 
This should be categorized as a pod or something like that. It should not be able to be listed as a regular hotel room, especially in america.

We had the standard queen and more than enough room for 2 large suitcases. For goodness sake anyone who has stayed in London or Paris knows what to expect in such a great location, and for 2 'normal' sized people the rooms here were more than adequate. Our room was on the 14th floor which may account for the lack of noise from the bars (although the Skybar is on the 15th floor).
The staff were all great, especially the concierge and I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying for pleasure. I can't comment on the business facilities.

"“Have been lustfully coveting an opportunity to stay at the Hudson.... was not all that I hoped for.” I travel quite extensively for work and in doing so I often can be found online looking for beautiful hotels to stay at during my travels and last fall I took notice of the Hudson Hotel and fell in love with the photographs I saw of this hotel. The outdoor space and lobby intrigued the artist in me and I found myself looking forward to when spring would arrive, which is when I wanted to visit this hotel so that I could enjoy it's beautiful outdoor spaces and lush spaces. Spring arrived and i booked my room. I was truly excited as I have been thoroughly enchanted with the photos of the hotel for quite some time.
I got to the hotel, and found myself in the belly of the beast...... the very front entrance, where you actually enter from the street and my heart sank. I was instantly reminded of the Yotel which is another hotel that I had been so disappointed in that I left the hotel early..... the front entrance you are immediately greeted by a neon like green light glowing and two escalators, with no instructions, no doorman, and no warmth. My heart sank to the floor but the reservations were made so I quietly proceeded bravely ahead. 
My heart began to flutter again once I was 3/4 of the way up the escalator...... I could see lush greenery hanging above and beautiful furniture beckoning me forward. Smiling I began to take in this beautiful enclave of dark colors, beautiful foliage hanging above and glassed ceilings. Ahhhh, this was the paradise I was seeking. 
I was greeted warmly by the desk staff and quickly checked in where they were also very thorough in giving me instructions as to where everything in the hotel was located. I was quite pleased with the extra attention to detail. I quickly headed to the elevators, wanting to hurry and see the room and explore this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of elevators that were available. Absolutely no waiting for one single elevator to be crammed into, but a multitude of elevators were available.
Once I stepped off of the elevator I found myself in a tastefully done galley area and proceeded to look for my room. I did find the hallways a little confusing and the decor of them left something to be desired much as the entrance had..... which worried me a little about the room, I wondered if this hotel had put all of it's effort into the main lobby and not into the private areas of the hotel. I held my breath and opened my room door and was pleasantly surprised. 
The room, while tiny, which is almost standard in NYC was bigger than I had pictured, but was warm and inviting. The bathroom is very tiny, and if you are taller than 5 ft 5 you might really have an issue with using the facilities as there is no leg room available unless you turn so that your legs are in the shower but as I am a tiny person it was sufficient for me. I had plenty of space for my luggage as well as a cubby type area to store my photography equipment.
I was eager to check out the rest of the hotel and was quickly off to explore...... which is where my true disappointment came into play. All of the patio areas were closed, with signs stating that they were currently hard hat areas, read construction going on...... I could peer out the windows to the beautiful lush wonder garden oasis but I could not relax amongst it's tranquility.... and this was the only reason I booked my stay here. Disappointment was intense and almost unforgivable as no where on the Hudsons site did it mention that their outdoor spaces were closed but as I did not wish to let this ruin the pleasure time of my business trip I forged ahead to explore more of this hotel and decided to have a cocktail at their bar the Library. 
The library is a smaller bar, with a interesting decor that could be cause for a good conversation while relaxing in one of their sublimely comfortable couches or intimate seating arrangements. I did enjoy the atmosphere but found the lack of sufficient bar staff a bit off putting as you had to wait an insanely long time to even order a drink that was a bit pricey and not that well made, but the surroundings made up for it..... I did find it was better to just order a double so not to have to wait an insufferable amount of time to order a drink and be served.
I do think, that while my trip to this hotel was not on par of what I expected, I will give the hotel another try, in hopes that it will live up to my original expectations and I will be allowed to relax in the tranquility of their outdoor spaces.
As a note, while I did not need my hundred dollar incidental charges back immediately, I had not used anything to be charged, I did out of curiosity, to see how I would be treated and to find out their answer, called after I left to inquire when I would be getting the charge released from my debit card, and was treated rudely by whomever it was who handled the call, and found that a hold of 3 days for incidental charges, which were not used, to be unacceptable. I travel extensively and, while the Hudson stated three days is the hotel industry standard, I disagree. Most hotels recognize the customers as being a priority, and expedite the return of the funds immediately. Many times I have found the release of the charges happen within hours of checking out and never over 24 hours, where as the Hudson did take a full 3 business days to do so.",j g,2012-05-01,223023,2012-06-01,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Affectionately Named 'Faulty Towers'” Great location, reasonable hotel.....just a shame about the total lack of service, organisation or help.
Stayed here on business and although the interior and rooms are nice (small rooms, but perfectly formed), the hotel service was terrible. When we booked the trip, we struggled to get hold of anyone to organise our stay and events and we should have cancelled at this point - but we had decided to persevere due to the location.
On arrival we asked for help with business needs/events and received conflicting advice or indeed, total lack of organisation in some respects. They didn't even warn us that scaffolding would be up outside the hotel and obscure the hotel i.e. we're having an event and it would be useful to inform people! 
They were unable to grasp the 'bill back' policy for our travel company, which took days and hours of sorting, which despite efforts was only resolved on check-out when they tried to charge my card (again). 
Too many other instances of poor organisation and service, that I wouldn't stay there again. Hugely disappointing for what should have been a simple stay.

"“TIny tiny rooms that must have been made for hobbits” So first impressions were great.The lobby is nice, it's big and airy, with a lot of wood, art installations and some fun greenery growing in the ceiling.

The room was almost my arm length if I was to stretch them from side to side, the bed was comfy; but I could have touched the wall with my foot at the end of the bed.

Don't call the room quiet when it isn't. I did not eat in the hotel, but my travelling companions who did, said it was very poor and dont bother. All in all this hotel is not great.

"“Cool hotel - but not to stay at” Having lived in NYC for many years, I used to go to the Hudson Hotel for drinks and dinner in the 2000's (at the Library Bar - which is still an awesome space, the clubby place, at what used to be Hudson Cafeteria, and outside on the terrace). I needed a hotel for the night, so I found the cheapest ""decent"" hotel available in NYC, which happened to be the Hudson. Since it is super close to a useful subway stop at Columbus Circle, and I had positive memories of the place from the times I've gone to the aforementioned places within the Hudson, I decided I would stay there. I wasn't expecting much and wasn't intending to spend a lot of time in my room. However, the room we received was literally no bigger than many closet and, to top it off, incredibly dark with no overhead lighting. The woman who checked us in seemed excited to give us a ""newly renovated room."" I could only imagine what the non-renovated rooms look like! I am a small person (a 5' 3"" woman), and I could barely sit on the toilet without my knees hitting the wall. Yikes. If I were coming to stay in NYC for more than 1 night, I would've had to switch hotels. There was literally not even a space for a suitcase, if I had had one.

"“All the basics with style” I was informed at check-in by a cheerful staff member that I had a recently renovated room.

“Great location and good value” I go to the Hudson regularly when in NYC without my children. I get a double double room which is a good size. The standard rooms are pretty tiny and dark.

"“Not worth the price” The ONLY reason they get 3 stars is because I arrived at 8:30 AM after a red-eye flight and the guy at the front desk was able to get me into a room way before the real check in time, which was great after flying all night. Stayed here on a business trip - hotel was planned by my company, so I didn't pick it. The rooms are microscopic (literally, a bed and 2 small side tables. That's the room), there was a hair in my bed when I checked in, my curling iron, etc was always left on the floor by housekeeping (gross), phone didn't work, internet worked eventually, street noise was excessive (and I sleep with ear plugs). If I was paying $100 a night, I might overlook these things, but for nearly $500 a night (that includes tax), the place should be perfect.

"“Very well designed, vibrant hotel, with a bit of room for improvement” Very well designed, Contemporary lobby accessed by a long escalator, good that the escalator is long, as the lobby is seriously dark – though this may be intentional for trend-factor.
Great locale, located 1 block west of Central Park,
Loved the Library lounge, though they close the bar a bit early, only after serving drinks 5 minutes before closing. Though the bar behind the lounge entrance was busy 
Room was a bit small and a bit dirty (light switches, paint in a couple areas) maybe not renovated ed on 16th floor yet

"“Good location, clean and friendly” I stayed at this hotel for four nights whilst on a business trip to NYC. The hotel staff were very friendly and the room was clean and even had a view overlooking part of Manhattan. For the price I had expected more though, in particular a larger room. Having read so many reviews by American visitors to Europe complaining about the small size of rooms in European hotels I was quite looking forward to seeing an American hotel room for the first time! But I realise New York (and Manhattan in particular) is not representative for America.The bed was comfortable and the location quiet yet central. Cleaning was very good, but the room had seen better days and the door was often difficult to open and close. Hopefully this room was going to be renovated since I understood many rooms had already been done up. 
I did not try breakfast in the hotel, but heard from others that it was good. At night time the hotel became a popular bar and meeting place, the lobby even felt like a club. But once you went up the elevator to your room it was quiet and I experienced no disturbances. The only noise (which was quite loud) was the collective sound of all the air conditioners in the courtyard. I did see the business centre downstairs as we had a meeting there. No complaints there and again the staff was very friendly.
The location was good - a few minutes on foot from Central Park which was lovely.

"“pleasant stay --- tiny room” I spent two nights at the Hudson on a last minute trip, so I opted to use Priceline and got a rate of $170 per night. Although the hotel lobby and common areas are truly beautiful, the size of the room was truly a disappointment. I've stayed in many NYC 3.5-4.0 star hotels and have never seen such a tiny room- and the bathroom is a joke- especially for those of us who are on the taller side. Come to think of it, I've stayed in larger rooms in European hotels (London, Paris, Amsterdam, Madrid...), which tend to be notoriously tiny.
I realize that the hotel cannot do much in terms of expanding room sizes, unless they do some major renovations. I just feel that it was not worth the expense, even though $170 is relatively cheap by NYC standards.
Bottom line, if room size doesn't matter to you, you will love the Hudson for its friendly staff and beautiful common areas- oh, and its perfect location. If you prefer space, then this hotel will not suit you. 
I would consider staying again, but only in a larger room.",claudia_m17,2012-02-01,223023,2012-05-20,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Solid, trendy, 3 star hotel” I'll confess, I got an excellent rate on Priceline - $89. I felt for the price we paid, it was exceptional and I was thrilled to stay here. The room was pretty clean, the staff was pretty friendly (what little interaction we had). Fine location and amenities. My disappointment was that I was expecting a 4-star hotel, as that was what I bid on, on Priceline. This is in no way a 4 star hotel, but it is absolutely a solid 3 to 3.5 star with great decor (although the rooms are dark). I had read here on TA that many rooms are very tiny, which is somewhat expected in NYC/historic hotels. I e-mailed management to let them know we were a couple that would be staying here and that I would be proposing to my partner while on the trip and that it would be nice to have (at least) a normal sized room or something on a higher floor with a decent view (again, just something besides a closet with no view) ...well, we arrived and checked-in to a closet with no view...I didn't raise any concern because of the low rate we paid.

Housekeeping even had the evidence, so there was proof of the horrid bug. We ended up moving to a sister property the next day, the Royalton. They were nice, helpful, and the room was clean.

"“Modern, convenient, helpful, no pretense” I spent two nights at The Hudson in early May 2012 for a conference held at the hotel. I found the experience to be quite positive. 
The hotel's exterior is distinctive and attractive, as is the second floor lobby. Some hotels in this category have a ""look at how unique I am! Aren't you lucky to be in me?"" feel, but the tone of The Hudson is more approachable; more, dare I say, humble. 
My room wan't ready when I arrived at 2:00, but the Library proved to be the perfect place to get some work done while waiting. Wifi signal was strong and the auth process simple. The person checking me in told me she would call when the room was ready, but after 90 minutes or so I hadn't received a call so I went to check and the room was ready. No big deal. Busy time of day for them.
Once I got in, the room was quite small. Very New York. Similar to rooms I have stayed at in The Standard or The W. Nice room, just small. It wasn't so small that it felt like the trash compactor in Star Wars though. The wood paneling in the room may have accentuated the smallness, but it was pretty unique. The rooms at Le Parker Meridien are slightly larger and have better desks. But the room was comfortable. 
The terrace on the 15th floor was great. Wonderful ambiance and view. The conference space was adequate, but it had a basement, roof is closing in on me feel. Even though it wasn't really in the basement. 
Columbus Circle, Lincoln Center and Central Park are all quite close by. Very convenient. 
Loud music in the bar off the lobby late into the night, but I couldn't hear it once I got up to my 17th room floor.

"“Nice Place, Small Room” First time stay at the Hudson. The hotel was very comtemporary and quite welcoming, even though it was very dimly lit. Part of the charm, I guess. The room was extremely small, but comfortable. Didn't spend much time in there anyway. The bar on the main floor, called The Library, was very nice and had a good crowd until closing. The nightclub adjacent to the lobby was incredible and rocked until about 3 AM. Staff was very friendly, and there are plenty of elevators, which I never really thought about until I stayed at a hotel with only one. The hotel is located 1 block west of Central Park, so there is not as much foot traffic as the area closer to Times Square. Not as much early morning noise, either. Also, there are not as many bars and restaurants as the Times Square area, but that's only 2 subway stops away, so no big deal.

So there were a few issues...peeling paint in places and a fickle air conditioner. However we loved the paneling in the room, the bedding was nice, and the ""issues"" were not major. The location was fantastic, close to Central Park and the subway was a short walk away. My youngest daughter is a minor, so we did not visit the bar.

"“Great service, upgraded room and nice time.” Just spent a great Saturday night there for my husband's birthday. We stay in the city quite often and I have to say we were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. I read the bad reviews and had friends tell us to stay away, but got a good deal and decided to roll the dice. How much time do you spend there anyway?
As for the room - I asked if we could get a room upgrade when we checked in because it was my husband's birthday. Olivia at the front desk was so nice and put us in a little bigger room on one of the recently remodeled floors. It was still small, but adequate and clean. It was not loud and we liked the see through glass to the shower. We overlooked the courtyard and had a blast.
The staff was awesome from the doormen to the front desk to the concierge to the bartenders at the club at night. 
We had afternoon cocktails on the rooftop bar before heading out, watched the Kentucky Derby in the restaurant and came back for a nightcap and a little dancing. I never spent so much time in a hotel and enjoyed it.

"“Definintely not a 3.5 start. Tiny rooms, rude service, and way overpriced” Rooms
I just spent one night here this weekend, and it was a terrible experience. The first room I was given is smaller than my kitchen (and I live in NYC), and it only had one bed for my male cousin and I. Two normal sized guys should not be forced to share a room. They said I could get a room with two beds for an additional $90. I booked through Priceline and this is the first time I've ever been denied a room with two beds for the same price, including at much nicer hotels. It didn't stop there- the first tiny room actually had a fridge in it, the second did not. I requested the fridge, it was brought to me, and then the next morning there was a charge for it on the bill.
Service
Front desk is pretty rude, and the manager is an absolute jerk. I explained to him the Priceline situation and he was dismissive, and said it happens A COUPLE TIMES A DAY!! That's over 750 times a year. Would you stay somewhere that backdoors and screws over it's guests 750 times a year. Unreal. The maids knocked on my door Sunday morning four times despite the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door. The club in the lobby refused to let my friends and I in for no good reason, despite having paid over $300 to stay in the room, which should give access to the club.
Bottom line, this place is terrible. I've stayed at a dozen other hotels in NYC and never have felt like I wasted my money so badly. The situation was so bad, every guest in the elevator felt the need to commiserate with each other.",rob808pf,2012-05-01,223023,2012-05-08,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Cool, quirky hotel - great location!” We stayed at this hotel in March 2012 for a 4 night stay. After a long day of travelling from the UK we arrived at the hotel in the evening and had our bags taken into the lobby by the doormen. We had a room upgrade at check in which we were very grateful for and found our room on the 17th floor. We had great views of the city from the room, very nice when many city rooms often offer an alley way or brick wall view!
The room was small but we weren't in the city to bumble around the room, it had everything we needed for the short break. The decor of the room was so clean and modern, the bedside lights were definitely a talking point - so funky! The bed was the comfiest bed I've ever had the pleasure of laying my head on in a hotel, lovely soft pillows and delicate bed linen. Plenty of wardrobe and shelf space for all the clothes that we had dragged over the pond. The double mirrors made the room feel bigger than it was, a clever trick when space is a problem in a built up city. The TV was in a problem position on the wall above the side of the bed, the narrow space between the bed and the wall ensured that my head hit the corner of the TV on more than 1 occasion during the stay. The bathroom was compact but had everything required and very bright and clean. The room was serviced daily and it went above and beyond the usual, items left out were tidied away and the room was generally made to look a lot nicer than it did as we left it each morning. 
The hotel is in a great Midtown location, the walk down to Times Sq seemed to take no time at all and you're on the doorstep of the corner of Central Park. The 59th St Columbus Circle subway station is at the end of the street providing links all over the city. There's plenty of cheap and easy eateries to grab a quick bite on your way in or out of the hotel, can definitely recommend the pizza place on the corner (Europan), next to the hotel. There's a CVS pharmacy across the street and a Starbucks and Pinkberry a few minutes down the street. 
We didn't eat at the restaurant in the hotel but we did have a few drinks in the Library Bar - a quiet end of the hotel with a great, relaxed atmosphere and cool music. The drinks were on the expensive side but what else do you expect in the middle of Manhattan? 
I would definitely return to this hotel in the future.

"“Great location, great price” We just came back from a 1 night stay. We booked on Priceline and were a little concerned after reading some of the reviews but we have no complaints. We were upgraded to a deluxe queen bed room so I am not sure what our original room would have been like. The room was recently renovated (according to a card in the room) so I also don't know how many rooms are not yet renovated. The room was on the smaller size but furnished with undersized furniture and the HD flat screen was mounted on the wall. All in all, I thought they did a nice job furnishing the room. The bathroom was small with a stall shower (no bathtub) but very useable. The room was quiet and clean. There are a,lot of rooms so the hallways go on for a while, but not an issue for us (you also have to take an escalator to the lobby). The property used to be a dormitory.

"“Better than expected......” Having read some of the reviews shortly before my visit i was apprehensive about what we would find. We are a couple - now both in our fifties having celebrated my 50th on this trip. The hotel was young, trendy but certainly not off putting for those a little older in years!! The dark reception is difficult on the eyes but very atmospheric, The music was upbeat but pleasant and toe tapping in the lifts. The staff were very friendly and helpful - we didn't experience any 'attitude' expressed in previous reviews. We were on the 12th floor over looking the courtyard and experienced no unreasonable noise and due to the amount of time spent sightseeing and walking - by the time our heads hit the lovely clean soft pillows - we had no trouble sleeping. I think we were very fortunate in having one of the larger rooms in the hotel and our room was perfectly functional, plenty of space for hanging clothes, storing suitcases and shopping and moving around. The bathroom was also a perfectly adequate hotel sized bathroom - modern, clean and lovely towels and toiletries provided. With regards to water in the rooms there were vending machines on every floor outside the lifts with drinks and snacks available and an Ice machine - easy to pick up on your way to your room.The location is excellent and we walked to most of the major attractions - very convenient for central park, Times Sq and Broadway.

I even had a problem with the water in my tub not draining properly when I was taking a shower, but I never mentioned this to the front desk - the housekeeper must have noticed it when she was cleaning and out in a work order and had it fixed before I got back to my room that night. That was great. 
For those who need to hit the gym while you are away (like me) the gym is one of the better ones I ave seen in a small hotel, 3 treadmills, some elliptical machines, free weights mats, water, towels, etc.
I did not have the opportunity to eat or drink in the hotel, but others on the trip did and had no complaints.
Yes, it is small. By far the smallest room I have ever stayed in (even smaller than ones on my trips to Europe.) And it is dark...very dark inside the lobby and the restaurant and the hallways, if you want a light filled space, this aint it.

"“Like a bad book with great cover art....” The good points first - great lobby, bar, and restaurant scene. Interesting ambiance, lots of personality, decent service with some wit and a little attitude - all good. 
Once you get passed this - the functional part of the hotel is tired, cramped, claustrophobic, dark, worn, shabby, uncomfortable and depressing. My rooms was a closet. The bathroom was so small, you can barely turnaround. The flooring in my room was loose and had puckered in a way that when I walked the three or four steps that the room allowed I made a loud sucking sound. A small TV was randomly mounted in the middle of one of the side walls. While I don't watch TV, this seemed like a rather odd arbitrary design choice. Nothing about the cramped space seemed thoughtful or designed to make someone feel relaxed and comfortable.
I suppose the defense of this design is that the price is supposed to make up for the lack of space and amenities. If they were charging hostel rates - this quality of room would be acceptable - but they aren't, not even close.
Basic recommendation - if you are in the area, stop by The Hudson for a drink or meal - but stay in one of the dozen or so other hotels in the area where you can be comfortable.",Datablade,2012-04-01,223023,2012-05-02,False,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“City Style and Nightlife near Central Park” Stayed at the Hudson as a weekend Staycation- a friend was having a birthday party in the Lobby Bar. The hotel is really fun and in a great location near Time Warner center. The lobby bar actually is a really cool
place to hang out. It is dark, lots of vines and interesting layout. The crowd at the bar is fun late into the night. I would reccomend this to someone single or a 25-38 year old couple visiting NYC. The rates are reasonable however rooms are small even by NYC standards. I did not feel cramped but I did opt for an upgrade, the space feels modern and comfortable. Good beds, work space, an good water pressure in the shower! Always important. Give it a try.

"“Not as good as we hoped” After hearing many good things about the Hudson, we felt it was lacking in a couple of areas. The rooms were very small. We knew they were before we went there but the bathroom in particular was very small. The shower was a narrow bath with shower curtains either side that stuck to you the moment you spun around. 
There was not a minibar in the room. Couldn't keep any food or drinks cool. They were vending machines at the end of the hall, but when you are staying at the very end of the hotel, this is rather frustrating to walk down the long corridors.
The only mirror in the room was in the bathroom and was very small. There was long no long mirror to see the whole outfit. One could have easily been placed on the inside of the cupboard door.
The wifi, whilst free, could not be picked up from certain areas of the hotel. We were on the 14th floor and the staff informed us we would have no chance of picking it up from there. We had to walk down to the lift and use it in the lobby.
We received a note informing us that the Hudson would be altering the rooms later in 2012 so perhaps these issues might be addressed.
On the plus side, the location is good, right near Columbus Circle subway.

"“A disappointment” I went for the third time at the Hudson Hotel. The lobby and the restaurant remain spectacular as far as the decoration is concerned. It is a young place full of music and young people
The rooms are ridiculously small and it is extremely difficult for two people to move in this tiny space.
The corridors are very noisy since you have constantly people entering and leaving their rooms all night long. This is due to the young crowd which are the majority of the Hudson customers which are keen to party the whole night long.
Another problem is the absence of room service.
All the above would be acceptable if the rates were really cheap but it is not the case when you pay for a double room over 300USD",AlbertBelgium,2012-04-01,223023,2012-04-30,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Trendy Hotel, Good Location and A Happy Guest” The one word I would use to explain the Hudson is ""Trendy"". The lobby is dark and seems to be all about the mood lighting or should I say lack of light. I couldn't tell what time of day it was when I was in the lobby. I have to admit they did do a good job making the hotel look cool and unique.
The location couldn't have been better for my trip and of course it was easy to catch a cab from the hotel.
No real complaints about the hotel. I didn't interact with the staff much, the beds weren't overly special, but I slept well and was fine with the size of the room. It was smaller than I was used to, but I expected it in NYC. The room was clean and well kept.

"“Fantastic Gem!” This hotel is absolutely magical. It is really a wonderful space and is such a fabulous escape from the crazy hustle and bustle of NYC. The staff are superb.

“A lot of expensive nothing” I have no problem spending money for a nice room. I like their studio rooms which are over 500 a night. How ever i think at that rate you might have your room when you check in. Morgan hotels are notorious for not having the rooms ready at check in time. Next everyone that works there has a attitude. Frankly i find that really boring. Go to the Library Bar and wait a good 20 minutes for someone to serve you. Breakfast which is just a buffet is 24 dollars. Coffee which is normally free is 6.00 a cup!!!! Not even a bottle of water in your room. There are so many beautiful hotels in NYC that will do much more for you. Don't bother with the Hudson.

"“Just Ok. You get what you pay for.” The location is AMAZING! 1/2 block from the SW corner of Central Park...just off Columbus Circle. You can walk to many things...many museums, CP, Times Square...the subway is very close. 
We booked through Priceline so I'm not upset about the price, but if I would've paid full price I would've been disappointed. The rooms and hotel were clean. The staff was the best part (especially the housekeepers). Every time you passed one..even if it was the 3rd time in 15 minutes they said hello and offered assistance if you needed something. 
I would NOT recommend this to people with kids, especially small kids or for a romantic weekend. Mostly for business, solo, or a quick weekend in the city when you know you won't be in the room. 
The rooms are ""cabin size."" Much smaller than anticipated. If it's just one person it would be fine as long as you don't have a lot of luggage. It was quite cramped and it was only myself and my husband for one night over his birthday. We live in close so the only luggage we had was a small carry-on. That being said, the designers made good use of the space. There is a full bathroom, small desk and TV mounted to the wall. There is about 2 feet of room on either side of the bed. The bathroom was even smaller.. The shower is about 1/2 the size of a regular one and I could touch both walls with my hands easily. For women, there isn't much room at all to get ready especially if you have to share the mirror. The windows are old and need replaced, quite drafty. You can hear the water running throughout the night b/c it is an old building. 
There is a bar with a pool table and an amazing outside space with a bar that is open during the summer. There is also an a la carte Tapas style restaurant with sports playing over the bar on large projection screens. I don't think most of the people there were guests. The food wasn't very good and it was overpriced. Go out to dinner elsewhere. The waiters were also not very attentive since it is a la carte.",MWoolley,2012-01-01,223023,2012-04-24,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“A mixed bag!” Booked this through Priceline at not a great price. Outside of hotel is covered in scaffolding so a bit difficult to recognise. You enter the hotel and take an escalator up to the large lobby area. Ellie was very helpful and friendly at checkin and we were happy to be able to checkin before 3pm! Lobby was a little on the dark side as were the corridors, not sure why. We opened the door to our room and although I had read reviews I have to say I was shocked at how small the room was!!! The bed dominated the space and there were a couple of small bedside tables and a small desk with only one chair. There was a tiny closet by the desk with a couple of shelfs, drawer and safe. The short corridor into the room had a small hanging closet with iron and board. The bathroom was pretty cramped too with a glass wall to the bedroom. The bed was comfortable but the first night the sheets were too small for the bed so moved around a lot. We left our towels hanging up and didn't request a linen change so were surprised to see new towels and bed linen, what's up with that??? Contintal buffet breakfast was $28 and it cost me $4.66 for a small decaff. Restaurant was quirky too with long medieval tables with bench seats and 'thrones' at each end.

"“Fab experience” The hotel is beautiful, from the moment we stepped out of the taxi the staff were very helpful and friendly. We were on the newly renovated 7th floor which was lovely, the room was small but reading ahead we already expected this, there is plenty of storage space in the bathroom and there was plenty of space to hang up our clothes and our 4 cases fit nicely under the bed. The bathroom was tiny (i'm a slim 5'2"" and i found the space tight) but we got use to it and the lovely shower soon made up for it! We found we had to use the air con regularly as the room was quite stuffy at night and on the saturday night we had it on all night to drown out the street noise. You can hear noise all night long but if you expect a quiet nights sleep don't stay in midtown in our experience no hotel can offer a silent night guarantee. The restaurant and bar were fab and there was free internet access using ipads in the reception area. This was our favourite hotel so far out of three, as a couple in their 20's we found the location near a starbucks and columbus circle fantastic for the morning, we could pop back from anywhere in the city to drop bits off, the staff were helpful and suggested new and interesting things to do away from the typical attractions and directed us to quieter designer shops elsewhere in the city and bent over backwards to help even after we had checked out we will probably return to this hotel on our next trip.",Taffline D,2012-04-01,223023,2012-04-14,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

Good to Know:
no gift shop or coffee shop in the hotel
don't miss the front door! it's small and would be easy to walk right by, but there is always someone there to open the door for you and let you know if you're in the right spot

Its a very popular brand found at Sephora. It's close to the park, shops, area is nice and only a few bocks to subway. For the price of the room I think I would rather have a room that I could strecth without touching all walls. The rooms are very noisy. The heating system was so loud we couln't sleep. To use the bathroom was so uncomfortable. You couldn't close the door, not even to wash your hands or face. You're not able to fit unless you are like 7 years old.

The food is excellent. The location is great for the park and uptown shops, not too far from the subway either. I recommend it but not really for the older generation - its a bit swanky and does love itself quite a lot - prices have rocketed so I'm staying away for now. The return on investment dives quite a lot over $150 a night. The bar is pretty fun - its raved about but I don't see what all the fuss is about. It gets very very busy quite quickly so get your seat early and guard it ! The music has always been pretty cool and that's the main attraction.

"“Overpriced” As a former New Yorker, I had been to the bars at the hotel for cocktails and always enjoyed myself. When I was in town to visit, I chose to stay here..bad idea. It's priced comparable to high-end hotels in the city, but the room was about half as big. In my mind the price should have been half as much as other places. I realize they're trying to make it a funky experience, but it went a bit too far. There was no place for us to put our suitcases. We had to put them in the miniature hallway/entry area and step over them to get to the bathroom. The bathroom was not in good condition either..peeling paint, and one of those toilets from decades ago without a tank and the flusher that sticks out from the pipe in the back (the kind in public restrooms that I use my foot to flush, never thought I'd had that in a hotel room). 
We finally decided to check out a day early when a hurricane was expected to hit NYC. The hotel handed out glow sticks in case the electricity went out; I would have preferred a flashlight..it was an emergency situation, not a party. We also received a note under our door that if things got really bad, we needed to stay away from the window in our room..there was literally nowhere in the room to go, so we decided to get far away and check out and stay with a friend. 
As expected, when we checked our bill later that week, they had put several charged on our bill for meals and drinks that were not ours.

"“Staff make up for user experience design flaws in this ""too cool"" hotel” The styling of this hotel is very cool and attracts a large crowd. With 807 rooms it is on the large size for a ""boutique"" hotel. Philippe Starck designed, there are many design features that surprise and both the interior and its occupants area visual feast of local urban adventure hunters and international jet setters.
Probably a wonderful experience for a social visitor, but sadly inappropriate for an international business trip. I have to take this one on the chin as a poor choice by my travel booker. I spent much of my time in lines waiting for the lift, desk service etc during peak hour. The staff were wonderful, polite, helpful and well-presented. There just werent enough of them to process the hoards of occupants. I got the impression the Hudson NY is a party hotel, attracting short stay patrons. 
I have very mixed views of my room. The rooms are tiny - about 13-15 square metres and very little size difference as you pay up the range. To open my suitcase I had to stand in the bathroom with my case on the floor in the hall. Reaching the shower involved climbing over the toilet. The bed was dreamily comfortable and the blackout curtains effective. The view of the courtyard was depressing and the drone of the air-con very loud. Vending machines in the hall offer a small range of refreshments - it seemed like a good idea, but trundling into public space with jetlag munchies was not appealling.
The lounge was wonderful, although the couple of surfaces available to sit at with a computer were cunningly disguising aircon units so there was no room for knees. At some time in the late afternoon / early evening the lounge opens up to the public so guests lose their private relaxation space.
Refreshingly huge gym with hardly anyone in it. Location couldnt be better - a stone's throw away from Central Park and a giant, healthy supermarket at Columbus Circle.

No room service after a certain hour, very typical of a low class hotel not an international chain! Vending machines in the corridors - very bizarre! 
Nice clean room - they first put us in a smoking room and managed to accommodate us when we requested to change it.
very close to central park where we went for a run every morning.

"“One night is too much for me - Never again!” Not for the business traveler - or anyone! The service was awful. First, I checked in at 10:30 pm and was told that I had a package awaiting me, and I could get it after 8am the next morning. I had a breakfast meeting which started at 8am - that's why I had the package overnighted the day before! So that was an issue. Then I called to get foam pillows as I am allergic to down. ONE HOUR later, I was still waiting, so I called again. NO ANSWER. This was midnight, i had to go down to the front desk myself and ask them to call again. The front desk still took their time, checking in a guest, until she notice me hovering. Housekeeping finally did come 10 minutes later. The deadbolt did not lock. The outleft to charge my blackberry did not work - which i discovered the next morning. The are NO CURTAINS. The blinds do not keep the sun out. So the morning sun comes streaming into the room at 6am! AND, when I went out to get a cab, the doorman was chatting with his homie and completely ignored me. And I was dressed nicely - I am a tipper!
And then the usual - the room is so small i hit my head on the TV that was hung on the wall when I got up in the middle of the night. And no coffee pot in the room is ok if I can order room service. But I couldnt't even do that!

"“Great hotel, fantastic location in NYC” We recently stayed at the Hudson Hotel in NYC. This was my 4th stay at this hotel. It is located just a few blocks from Central Park and is right down the street from the Time Warner Building and the Subway. The Hotel itself has a hip vibe. Rooms at the lower price range are small but functional. Feels almost like you are in a ships cabin. When you enter you have to go up the escalator to get to the lobby. Once in the lobby you do get a sense that the hotel is different. You feel almost as if you are in a greenhouse. The outdoor patio areas(while I did not use on this trip due to the winter weather) are a great place to hang out as well as the library indoors. The thing that sets this hotel apart is the extremely welcoming and helpful staff. I have eaten at the restraurant in the past and it was very good. I like to walk down to whole foods when I stay here and get breakfast from the food bar or lunch from the food bar and take a walk in Central Park. One of my favorite restaurants is in this neighborhood....Guantanamera which has Cuban fusion food and great latin jazz and is quite reasonable in cost. One comment on the dim hallways, don't be put off, when we were there it looked like they were sprucing them up. Also, we got a fantastic winter deal on the price, so it was better priced than most economy level hotels. Be aware that during high season it can be quite expensive to stay here.",DMG33,2012-02-01,223023,2012-04-01,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Dont be fooled by the fancy lobby and bar!!” I stayed here two nights on a work trip. On arriving after checking in and going up to the 4th floor, my room door was not only locked but could open a few inches whilst locked!...the room key would then not work...after going down to reception twice in the painfully slow to arrive esculators- (with cases) i still could not get into my room. I was appalled that i had not been offered help with my bags or a member of staff to assist me in ensuring i could get into my room. Eventually i was given a new room- and i had to request for assitance. The rooms are small and noisy- it could be said that it felt as though the window was open!! It was also disappointing that there was no tea making facilities in the room. The only positive was the cleanliness of the hotel and the impressive lobby entrance.

"“Nice location, small rooms” This was my third time staying at the Hudson in four years. I was hoping I'd get a room upgrade for being a return guest, but no such luck. My favorite things about this hotel are the location, friendly staff, unusual style, and comfortable beds. My least favorite things are the dim hallways, tiny rooms, tiny bathrooms, and lack of space to comfortably fit 2 small carry-on suitcases. 
Location: a few minutes walk to CNN headquarters, the subway, central park, Starbucks, and a very stylish indoor shopping mall which includes a jazz venue, Whole Foods Market, and a variety of small high-end shops. Columbus Circle is a busy, stylish, jumping off point for a lot of different adventures. 
Atmosphere: a trendy boutique hotel with an unusual lobby. Public spaces are very dark, including the hallways. 
Rooms: I've only experienced a small room with insufficient space for two carry-on suitcases. The bathroom is also uncomfortably small. If you're a large person or claustrophobic, you will probably be uncomfortable. If you're average size and flexible, you'll be fine. If you're petite and travel very light, this place was designed for you. 
Overall, the location makes up for a lot. Also the housekeeping staff do a great job, the place is very clean. And if you get a good deal, it's probably worth the cramped space. They were remodeling some floors when I was there, but I didn't notice any noise or inconvenience. 
The Hudson was selected for me by Priceline/name your own price all 3 times... I got a good deal.",boomerz,2012-03-01,223023,2012-03-29,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“your iPod is too big to fit in the bathroom” The hotel has a fun entrance with dark, swanky lighting, a sweeping lobby and plenty of trendy background music that make you feel like you have arrived somewhere special. The elevators look cool, and then voila!... you arrive on a floor that looks like a dirty dorm at college with filthy carpets and broken lights. Then you step into the worlds TINIEST of hotel rooms! Just enough room to get around your bed, a bathroom that you practically have to step over the toilet to get to the shower. If this doesn't bother you (""oh I don't spend much time in the hotel anyway"") then these digs are going to be good.
The location is great, close to Central Park & the Time-Warner Center as well as the 1/9 and A/C/E subway stations. The staff was helpful, in particular Alex at the front desk who helped me get over a particularly rude experience with a cook in the breakfast bar. 
By the way, no in-room coffee? Or room service to get it? Tsk, tsk. At least Starbucks is practically next door. I'd go back if I got a better rate, it wasn't worth $225 a night, even by Manhattan standards.",bench275,2012-03-01,223023,2012-03-29,False,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Trendy” On arrival at JFK, our taxi took us straight into the city. He did search to find this hotel as there is no signage at all! It felt quite strange heading up an escalator going ""somewhere"" and coming out in the hip lobby area. The decor is trendy and well done throughout the hotel, but we preferred to eat outside of the hotel - the style of food was not for us.

"“Nice hotel, even if a bit dark...” The hotel is easy to miss from the outside; no obvious signage. Escalator up to the second floor. Hip lobby and reception area. Very friendly check-in staff at the desk. Lobby area is rather dark, with accent lighting. Rooms were also a bit dark and small, even by New York standards. I found it difficult to sit comfortably on the toilet with my knees almost scraping the opposite wall. And when standing in front of the bathroom sink, my shoulder rubbed the side wall. Bathroom had nice bath amenties, lotions, etc., and was well lit. Bed was a platform bed and quite comfortable.
Room service is not available, but there is a restaurant and bar - open for breakfast and dinner only; lunch is not available. The restaurant is also rather dark and offers only cafeteria-style food, no table service or ordering off of the menu. Also plenty of nearby restaurants and cafes within walking distance.
Easy access to the subway lines and taxis available constantly in front of the hotel.

"“New York, Bargain style.” The owners have created the ambience of a boutique/stylish hotel from a residential building, and created a hotel that delivers contemporary style at a value price.
The staff was consistently friendly, breakfast was good. Internet was included, but it would not function on my iPad in the first room I was given. A room change solved the issue.
The Hudson is a good product. Yes, some of the design tricks are lighting and paint, but that's how you get a good rate in NYC. Some hallways are sci-fi dark, and nobody seemed to be able to read the elevator buttons in the dramatic penumbra. Frankly, some of the things that were ""missing"" I was glad to be without (tip hungry bellboys, etc.).
Rooms are a bit small, but given the rate I paid, I would happily stay here again.

"“Matchbox size rooms” I could barely fit my suitcase through the front door; hallway is that narrow. The bathroom is uncomfortably tiny and that's where the only outlet is. There is no counter top...I dried the sink and put my stuff in it. The tv is on a wall and you have to go past it sideways to get to the alarm clock. That's how tight it all is. There are two lights flanking the bed with eery drawings of young children. I turned them away so I don't have to look at them.
The bed is hard and uncomfortable.

"“Comfortable, modern but a bit dark” Yes the rooms are small, but not so much so that they cause a problem. They are pleasant, comfortable and clean. We had a good room on the 16th floor that had recently been re-furbished. The staff were excellent, really helpful and friendly, and the location was great. The lobby and corridors were very dark, which - yes - looks cool but isn't very helpful when you're trying to find your way around or meet someone. The library bar is very expensive - $14 for a gin and tonic (although cocktails were about the same price - should have had one of those but couldn't see a price for g&t and wrongly assumed it would be cheaper!).

"“Excellent stay” I booked for my mum and me to stay at the Hudson for five nights. I was concerned after reading Trip Advisor about the size of the rooms. As my mum is claustrophobic I asked if it would be possible to get an upgrade and we were lucky enough to get this. Thank you very much for sorting this for us Meredith!!!
The room was excellent, we had two double beds with lovely fresh clean white cotton bedding and the beds were sooooo comfy! The bathroom was a good size with plenty of clean fresh towels. The hotel itself is quite quirky and unusal, the staff were very helpful and friendly especially Darwin! The only negative was that we were charged $32 for two Margarita's which I thought was outrageous but suppose we are in NYC!!
The location was fab too with access to all shopping areas by foot and cental park just across the road. Columbus circle tube station just down the road.
All in all I would like to thank the Hudson for all their help and cooperation for giving me an upgrade which ""made"" our holiday in NYC one to remember and will definitely stay here again.

"“Location, Location, Location!!!!” I booked this hotel by a bidding third party website, and when the name was published, I was a bit concerned, as I immediately went to Tripadvisor to see the reviews. All my worrying was for nothing. The hotel was in the perfect location. Subway stops at the corner, drugstore, Starbucks next door, nice little deli next door, Time Warner mall across the street, 10 minute walk to Time's Square, 3 minute walk to Central Park. The room...I traveled with my 14 year old daughter, and 20 year old daughter, and had 2 double beds on the 23rd floor. We were not bothered by noise from the hotel. We had a nice view of 7th ave, and no noise from the windows. The bathroom wasn't spacious, but it wasn't teeny tiny. The girls had plenty of room to do their hair and makeup. The room itself was quite cute. It wasn't extremely spacious, but there was plenty of room for 4 suitcases, and the 3 of us to move around comfortably. The room was also extremely clean. I have stayed at numerous midpriced hotels in NYC, and this was one of the better ones so far. Far more roomy and clean for the same price as other hotels. The lobby was beautiful, as well as the garden area. The only down sides were the dark hallways, and at the Lobby Bar $14 for a glass of wine. The staff was friendly and helpful, and if you can over look the dark halls and bring your own wine, and keep in mind you are staying NYC, you will be quite happy with this hotel.",kirbey38,2012-03-01,223023,2012-03-19,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The bathroom was very good and included nice products for the face, body and hair. Hotel location was great as it is located one block from Columbus Circle/Central Park and the subway. Guests varied from older folks to young people in their 20's. I did not see any families. The lobby was hip and was busy on a nightly basis.

"“Better than expected!” I stayed here with my friend this week (12/03 to 15/03) and found it to be so much more than we expected. 
The entrance is just wow then you get to the lobby and the wow continues. When we checked in the guy behind the desk was friendly, funny and extremely helpful. We originally booked to share a double bed and he asked if we would like two single beds- no extra charge. When we got up to the room we had a view of the Hudson River and the room was big! Considering we had prepared ourselves for a small room, it was great. 
This was our first trip to NY and not knowing what the location was like- The Hudson is well situated. 10 mins, if that, from Times sq and Fifth avenue. And hardly any time to Central Park. Also if you choose to stay here you should go to The Flame for breakfast- just turn left and cross the road and you'll find great pancakes! (this was also a helpful tip from the staff)
I would definitely return to this hotel the only thing I would say is it is a hotel more for younger people- which suited us perfectly, but i can understand some people may not like it.",LDNYC12,2012-03-01,223023,2012-03-18,True,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Good, not great” This hotel is located convenient to Central Park and a few subway stations, so the location is great. There are obviously, numerous places to eat nearby. The hotel lobby is very nice, and the amenities on the lobby level (one level up from street level) are very contemporary. The staff is all very nice and helpful. Now, the room. This is truly a BOUTIQUE hotel, so if you're expecting a suite at the Ritz, you'll be disappointed. My son and I got the deluxe room which consisted of two full size beds that sit on the floor....well, they sit on a foundation that is on the floor making the bed very close to the ground. The room was clean, but there are no dressers to stow your stuff, so you pretty much have to live out of your suitcase. We were there for five days, so it tends to get a bit jumbled up. The bathroom is clean and small as well. Overall, the room was OK, but truly, nothing to write home about. If you're in NYC, and only need a place to sleep and wash up, this place is fine. If you're looking for something extravagant, there are other places out there, but you will pay the premium price for it. Would I go back? with my son, maybe.

"“Good if you're open to something different” My wife and I just returned from a 3 night stay at The Hudson and we're both happy with our experiences. I certainly had some trepidation, reading some of the negative comments but overall, I'd say The Hudson represents the diversity of New York City.
No question the rooms are small, as is the tight bathroom. Perhaps it's because my wife and I are not big / tall people but the room is very usable for its size so long as you're not planning to spend a lot of time there. The bed was very comfortable and the housekeeping was certainly fine, with fresh towels and bath products daily. We loved the ""peek a boo"" window in the bathroom, although some may dislike it for privacy reasons.
Having read comments about noise, we asked for an inner room, which we received on the 14th floor. We didn't hear any of the music from the lobby but street noise was audible, if not really noisy. There are double paned windows, which we had closed and yet noise was present. After a little investigation we figured the air conditioner was the culprit, the type used requires it exhaust to the outside, meaning you have an opening in the wall for air and noise transfer. Fortunately, it was not so loud as to prevent sleep.
If you're expecting a traditional beige hotel like many national chains, The Hudson is not that. Yes, the overall feel is dark but in a considered and deliberate way, not because of lack of light fixtures. The lighting adds to the style of the hotel, which is certainly Urban. You have to remember the hotel was designed by Philippe Starck; if you don't know who he is, you're best to Google him.
The various staff we had interaction with were all very friendly and professional, from check-in to the fellow manning the luggage room.

But rest assured, I had a great experience here. Yes, the rooms are small, but I wasn't holding any banquets or concerts in it, so that was okay. The bed was comfortable and the decor was great. All I was doing in them was sleeping in this room, so I didn't need the Taj Mahal space for that. 
The only slight problem was that the windows are too thin. I can hear the street noise. But after I fell asleep, it didn't keep me up. The staff was very helpful, asking if I needed anything, trying to hail a cab as I left every time. The location is close to everything. Central Park, Rockefeller Center & Times Square. The subway line is right down the street. Very convenient.

"“Tiny Rooms, Pretenious instead of hip” So the popular thing with hotels in places like NYC are hotels that are hip and trendy. Basically, those are 2 words for - tiny, pretentious and overpriced. Do NOT stay here.
First of all, the staff was fine. Typical hotel staff.
Secondly, the rooms were just emabarassingly small. I'm the kind of traveler that doesn't spend much time in my room, and this gave me reason to be out. It was just ridiculous how small and underwhelming it was. 
Lastly, the bar-lounge-dance floor-whatever it was, is stupid. Maybe they are still figuring things out. That doesn't keep snooty patrons from walking around with their noses in the air thinking they are trendy. All in all, you will be embarrassed if you go with someone to this place. Don't do it...

At 15:00 my room was ready. The room is VERY small but I am used to European hotels. it is beautifully designed, the shower is transparent to the bed area, but could be hidden if it bothers anyone.
Walls are a little thin and i could hear a lot of the noise my neighbours were doing. but not a big deal, I have no problem to sleep in little noise.

I liked the location so close to central park and plenty of good dining options. The rooms are very small but fine for two people.

"“Great value in a handy location for all the sights” I stayed at this hotel in February for 4 nights. I chose it despite the bad reviews using the 'map function' on tripadvisor in order to be close to all the action and I wasn't disappointed. The website is clear about the size of the rooms, so no surprise that it was small. I was actually glad there was a bath rather than just a shower, even it is was half sized - still big enough to sit down in and nice to take the weight off your feet after a long day's sightseeing! I didn't much like the decor in the bedrooms - very dark wood on the walls and not really enough lighting, but it was clean and perfectly acceptable considering what I had paid and how handy the hotel is a base to explore the city. I thought the breakfast was extraordinarily expensive (over $30 for a pain au chocolat, some fruit, yoghurt, tea and orange juice) but dropped in at a supermarket nearby to grab my own much more reasonably priced food for subsequent breakfasts. It would have been nice to have a kettle and tea/coffee in the room, in an idea world. The service when I checked in/out was friendly. I was able to store my bags all day with the porters on my last day which was a bonus.

“Terrible” The hudson hotel is a terrible hotel! Rooms are not bigger than a walk in closet. U can literally extend your arms and touch both walls. You sit on the toilet and your knees touch the wall. The tub is half the size of a normal one and was mold everywhere. No room service and the vending machines snacks are two dollars a piece. Cool looking bar but will not let the guests in unless you are dressed in a suit. There is no running downstairs for a quick drink.

"“Unique but VERY small rooms...” Staying at the Hudson is quite an experience. It’s a chic place with its dark ambiance and flute music playing on every floor but understand that if you get a regular room it is going to be small, even by New York standards. My room was smaller than a cruise ship cabin and those are usually small. It was big enough for the queen bed and not much else. The bathroom was about the size of an airplane lavatory. Space is limited in New York and the Hudson has done its best to maximize its space. 
It seems the hotel gets its hip identity based on the overall ambiance which makes up for the tiny rooms. Plus going to New York should not be about the time you spend in the hotel. The beds are very comfortable, the rooms have HD TV’s attached to the walls, and the bathrooms are clean and well stocked.
The bar area is fun at night. Breakfast is an experience. Most hotels make their breakfast areas bright and airy but the Hudson’s is more like eating in the dungeon of a Harry Potter film. It’s very dark and quiet and you eat at thick wooden tables – some long tables with big kings chairs like out of a renaissance film.
Overall it’s a fun experience but I felt much more at home the next night when I arrived at the Marriott.",Alex S,2012-03-01,223023,2012-03-09,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The personnel at the door, bellman etc were wonderful, both coming and going.
the location is excellent, steps off columbus circle. The visuals are lovely.

"“4 star really?” I am currently living in this hotel. Stay here for two nights, one more night to go. I am in architectural profession, so I have lots to say. Good things first, clean, and staffs are nice, at least at the reception desk. So I gave one point to this, and plus the location is very good. The other point for the public space, where are the lobby, library.
Bad things, the room is tiny, but that is not an excuse. Using brown color wood panels to cover the wall, which is bad decision, it made the room dark, and the material just so cheap! It feels like painted plywood. No Ectrical outlet on the wall, only an extension cable, which you need to unplug some devices from the room. The bed, clean, but they use three linen sheets, two sandwiches the blanket, one cover the mattress. That is normal, however, when you get in your bed, you mess up with those sheets, then you can see the mattress is not looked kind of old,which is not good at all.tv screen, is too small, and not at good location, even it has supporter can turn the angle, but just a little bit. The hair dryer, it's the cheapest one you can find at a dollar shop probably. It's a four star hotel! Ladies would hold on that for a long while. What is cost for a good wall mounted hair dryer?! Bathtub, not a good idea to put bathtub in such a small room. If you want take a hot shower and relax, who would want to use a bathtub, which you even can't stretch your legs? And plus, the tub is white, that is good, but, if you want to sit into the tub, you would not want the tub with the sandblasted texture, cuz, it doesn't feel clean. Air conditioning, there is reason that why you need an architect to design your building. If you don't think good enough, like here, they put the heat venting right behind your bed. It makes a lot of noise! Common sense, come on! 
This is the first time I visit NY, I don't know what is the standard for a four star hotel, this one is not in my mind.

"“Unique, friendly and made to feel very welcome.” I stayed at the Hudson Hotel with my daughter for her 21st. We knew the rooms would be small from the reviews but we were pleasantly surprised. We had a deluxe room. This was very functional and had everything we needed. It was very clean. The package that we had purchased included free wifi. Fab for sorting out daily activities. We had to ask where the hotel was and we were directed to the front door. We had had an 9 hour travel and it was lovely to be so warmly welcomed. The reception staff were extremely helpful especially Sabrina. Yes it is dark but I'm sure that is just for the boutique ambiance feel. We had cocktails on the roof top bar. So quaint and the views are lovely. There are lovely comfy chairs, sofas and hammock to steal a moment. We also tried cocktails in the Library and the outside bar. This was a great place to people watch. We had breakfast on one morning and although not cheap was beautiful especially the fresh mixed berries, yum! The hotel is about 8 min walk to Central Park and a bit less of the subway. We would definitely stay again.

"“Would not stay here again” Positive:
Concierge was fab. Gave us good tips on cool bars to go to and also made reservations for us in restaurants. 
Check-in staff were very friendly.
Breakfast was delicious and staff were very accommodating
Shared areas on Lobby level are tastefully decorated and comfy.
Negative
As soon as you leave the lobby level it's downhill I'm afraid.
WISH I'd taken the trip advisor reviews more seriously before we booked. The rooms are terrible. Unpleasantly small. There wasn't space to unpack suitcase and by the end of our trip, despite both making a huge effort to be even tidier that usual, there was just stuff everywhere. 
Bathroom is hideous and the miniature bath is stained and looks dirty.
Under the bed was very dusty. I was looking under as desperately looking for somewhere to put my shopping bags!
No water, coffee, tea, fridge etc. No room service, only a vending machine.
Can't open the windows in the room, so no fresh air or ventilation.
They charge you for incoming calls....It was about 18 dollars for an incoming call from a local number....was not happy at all to see that on the bill.

When I entered my room I found it to be awkwardly small, non-functional, dirty and gross. The entire room just gave me the heebie jeebies. This is suppose to be an upscale hotel?

"“Good Location but......” We enjoyed our stay at the Hudson and found the hotel and the room pretty good, albeit we had a delux double and it was still very small. 
Positives are the location easy to walk to most places and close to the park. The staff was on the whole really nice and helpful with any requests. 
Couple of negatives are that you can hear every single sound of street noise even 10 storeys high I could here laughing shouting cars sirens, and on top of this our air conditioning unit was SO noising that whilst trying to sync from London to New York time this did not help and kept us awake for a lot of the night - it was a toss up between being awake and freezing or awake with noise but warm!!!! 
There is not mini bar and to be fair no amenities in the hotel at all other than the hotel bar and restaurant. The food was good in the restaurant but an odd concept of selecting a dish from the pass - it was good but if you are screwed if you want to eat the same as you someone else in your party as only 1 of each dish at a time available!!

"“Would definitely stay there again!” Just returned from a one night stay with my 22 year old daughter. Yes, it is true, you can not find the entrance to this hotel. There is scaffolding at the moment outside so maybe the sign is obstructed from view? Look for the entrance with a visible up and down escalator. Lobby is on the 2nd fl. Very unique atmosphere. The corridors are under low light but adequate. I have stayed at many Hotels in Manhattan and this was a nice surprise. Got the one night for $120.00 inc. tax through Priceline. Yes, the room is small but well designed. The window between the bathroom and the bedroom area is a little strange but I am sure it is to make the room appear larger. You can pull the liner of the shower across it to get privacy....or not. Very safe and very convenient location. I used the Icon parking within 200' or less from the hotel. (Look for coupons on line). When I went down to the front desk in the morning to tell them that our window on the 17th floor would not close tightly and that there was a lot of traffic noise (which was very annoying because I am a light sleeper), the woman at the front desk gave me two vouchers for their wonderful (rather pricey) breakfast!

"“Great place to stay!” Booked this hotel through Priceline at a very reasonable price. The rooms are small, but if you are just two people, this shouldn't be a problem.

The windows do not provide much insulation from the noise outside, and New Yorkers love to honk those horns! The Malin & Goetz toiletries in the bathroom were a nice touch. 
The staff was very friendly at check in, and in providing recommendations of places to eat and drink. The hotel has a really hip look, and I loved the decor.

"“Don't know what to think” The public spaces are dark, the elevators are dark; almost to the point of not being able to see the numbers on the buttons, but the worst for me was the poor lighting in the room itself. The bathroom is lit by an illuminated mirror only. It is nowhere near bright enough to put on makeup etc. I had to go out of the bathroom and open the blinds to try to get some natural light. Bathroom too small to use the blowdryer with the door closed, you have to leave the door open and kind of use the hallway space as well. But, the weirdest thing is the window into the bath from the bedroom. It is covered by a sheer net curtain, and you can see in quite clearly. Also, when you take a shower, there is a curtain on both sides of you and they both kind of blow into the tub making you feel like you are wrapped up like a mummy. 
The room was hot, we had to use the air conditioning the whole time (in February!) but it blows right from behind your head while in bed, making it kind of uncomfortable at times. One night, the heater/AC unit started banging in the middle of the night, and took quite a while to stop. Also, there are no black-out curtains , just a rather mangled venetian blind that lets in quite a lot of light, so if you need a dark room for sleeping you're out of luck here.
The room was nice and clean, the bed & pillows were comfortable, the toiletries were really nice, we didn't have a problem with noise from other rooms or hallway. But the size is quite comical, even considering you don't spend much time in your room. You have to take turns moving around the room, being careful not to bang your head on the wall-mounted TV.
Location is also good, near lots of cafes and less than a block to either Central Park, or the big Columbus Circle subway station.

"“Chic, Hip, Boutique Hotel” This is my second time staying at the Hudson and it continues to live up to its lofty reputation. Conveniently located near Central Park two blocks from Columbus Circle in Manhattan, this hotel provides easy access to midtown, subways, the park, theatre district and much, much more. But why go anywhere when you can enjoy all the amenities that this establishment has to offer. 
When you arrive you might wonder where is the hotel? Inside the doors you'll take the escalator upstairs where you are treated to a very creative and stylish expansive lobby and greeted by young staff eager to please. Just behind you will be the place to go for a late evening of the latest hot dance tunes and a beautiful crowd that you'll both want to watch and join. Or, if you prefer a more subtly hip scene retreat to the Library with its own small bar, comfortable lounge chairs and central pool table. Read, play chess or backgammon, shoot pool or simply enjoy the scene with a mixologist's fine cocktail. 
I ate here at their college dormitory style communal seating ""dining hall"" and I must admit that the food, served buffet style, was quite good and didn't break the budget, especially for midtown Manhattan. 
By the way, just a few blocks east along 58th Street you'll find an excellent choice for breakfast, lunch or light dinner at Le Pain Quotidien. You can't go wrong here. Excellent coffee and many good healthy choices on the menu. 
Sure the rooms are small at the Hudson but who spends hours on end in a hotel room anyway. With all there is to offer you won't want to be spending a whole lot of time in your room, unless of course you become addicted to their very comfortable futon beds.

"“Great place, Great Location , Great Staff.........!!!!” Before I arrived at the Hudson I was a little worried about what to expect, I had read all the reviews of people who were dissatisfied with the rooms and certain aspects of the Hotel....

If I was to be picky I would say my only criticism is there was no kettle in the room to make warm drinks with.
As for the Hotel itself it is a really charming modern chic hotel, and I would recommend staying there to anybody, I will be stayin here again on my next visit, the library bar is very cosy and the gardens are really nice, it has a very calming relaxed atmosphere during the day which is great after walking around. manhattan all day. the best asset of this hotel as to be its staff who were extremely well manored and helpful I was extremely impressed by the staffs enthusiasm they couldn't do enough for you.

Then I explained the incident to the front desk I was quickly whisked away to the basement of the hotel and treated very badly by a security person who didn't bother to give me her name.
What I wanted to do was alert the front desk to a very serious problem. I was hurt when I crashed into the unmarked closed door. The security personel were more concerned about me lodging a formal complaint against the hotel. 
In the end, they lost a potential champion. 
This is an old incident but it still brings back a bitter taste for a hotel that I otherwise felt was perfect for my business trips to New York.

"“Excellent location - very comfortable” The Hudson Hotel, though very diffficult to find, was excellent. We have been to many hotels in New York but this one would be up there as 'different'. The lift to the reception is very cool - but the place is sooooooo dark - reception, lifts, corridors ... lovely ambiance but would like if it was a little brighter in parts anyway. Why is it so dark .... the room was great - not anything like the rooms in Hotels in Ireland but when you are in New York, this is what we have come to accept. it was exceptionally clean and the bathroom was also very clean. The location is excellent right next to columbus station and central park. Found some lovely restaurants close by, opposite Carnegie Hall for breakfast... beautiful. The price of drink in the bar was way too high .. very disappointing really .. but we found this to be the case all through New York. The staff were excellent and very helpful and food was very good also. We did the High Line Walk and visited the Irish Hunger Memorial - both well worth a visit as we stopped off at the Chelsea Market also - excellent. We had done alot of tourist related things on previous visits to NY so we didn't revisit them . However, we did take in another show in Radio City - this was excellent as usual. Shopping was great of course. We had another fantastic trip to NY - I woudl definitely recommend this hotel for its cleanliness, locaition and staff but please, turn on a few lights or change the paint .....",Holiday-ireland,2011-11-01,223023,2012-02-20,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Funky hotel, suited for younger travellers” Great hotel, the decor and bars are brilliant in the hotel. In true ny style this a hotel that never sleeps, we arrived back to the hotel after midnight and the hotel was more like a club. There were bouncers on the lift which was a nice touch making sure only guests were allowed near the rooms. All the staff were extremely helpful, sharing ideas and recommendations for our trip.

"“Smallest Room I've Ever Stayed In - But I Felt Like James Bond” The Hudson hotel is definitely different from just about any other hotel on the planet. The first thing to note about the hotel is that it is literally impossible to find. The address is not printed on the front of the building and there are no labels at all indicating that it is a hotel. 
Since the hotel didn't mention this to us it took about 45 minutes of driving around the block and searching to find it. Definitely not a great way to start a trip and with all the one-way streets driving around the block means really driving around about six blocks each time.
When you enter the hotel it doesn't look like a hotel and there is nothing indicating it would be. There are a bunch of doors leading to nowhere and some large egg-like statues. Then there's an epically long escalator and only at the very top do you realize you've reached the hotel!
I asked in the lobby why this was so hard to find and they said, ""People stay here who don't want to be found."" I actually thought that was pretty cool and I felt a bit like James Bond after that. 
The room I stayed in was 140 square feet making it the smallest room I've ever stayed in EVER, and I've been all over Europe and Asia. The bed itself really isn't a bed but instead a rock hard futon. 
The bathroom was so small that I managed to bruise my elbow, knee, and leg in one spin move that made me feel like I had been beat-up for the rest of the trip. The staff was pretty snooty and the concierge really didn't want to help with much which is disappointing since this is fairly important in a city like New York.
The only reason I did not rate this ""Poor"" is because the location is amazing and the price is very low. Located in the heart of mid-town it really is easy to get everywhere from this hotel and at $130/night you really can't beat this price in New York City.

"“Great hotel for Smurfs” We stayed at the Hudson for a quick overnight stay this week. It had been recommended by colleagues of my husbands. I agree that it is probably best suited to the young, clubbing set (however, when we tried to get a drink from the main bar before 11, we weren't really welcomed.) The rooms are beyond small. Two adults cannot pass each other without one squishing up against the wall to let the other pass. It was hard to dry my hair in the tiny bath and not bang my elbow against the door. My husband hit his head on the tv getting into/out of the bed. The room was too warm until I put the AC on. It was very quiet however. The gym was well sized and nicely equipped. We had no food or other services. It is a great location but too small for our comfort.

"“Prepare to be claustrophobic!” WOW. These rooms were so tiny! My knees were bruised after sitting on the commode. The bathroom was so small!!!!. The room itself was almost like being on a cruise ship cabin...without the luxury...and it was smaller. I was given a room with a view. HA. The view was a window behind the bed. In order to see out of it I had to climb onto the back part of the bed and sort of hover to look out the window. While in the bed itself you could almost touch all 4 walls. The TV was hung on the wall in such an odd spot that you got a crick in your neck trying to watch it. The desk was minute and the chair was made for people under 5 ft tall and 100 lbs. It was just absurd. 19th floor and super noisy....poorly sealed windows.
The good: The bed was pretty comfortable. Hotel lobby and bar were fantastic...but a little dark. Close to Columbus Circle and Central Park.

"“Lime Green Neon Trip” This hotel is a labyrinth. From the twists and turns of the trippy, lime-green, neon-lit hallways to the roundabout way to enter and exit the bar, this hotel is a bit confusing for my taste. The hallways are reminiscent of college dorms, and the rooms are about the size of one. The rooms are very tiny, even by New York standards. The bathrooms lack counter space. And there was one outlet in the room for chargers, hair straighteners, etc. Further, the service was off. Upon arrival, I asked for an ice bucket and two champagne flutes. They told me they didn't have those for guests. Excuse me? You have TWO bars. Speaking of the Hudson Bar, I asked if I needed reservations to get drinks that evening. The first response by the front desk girl was ""How many girls are you? Are there guys coming?"" I'm sorry, but this is not South Beach. I'm a female guest in the hotel. It shouldn't matter if I want to bring one male friend in. And considering when we did go, we were clearly the only bargoers around the age of 30. Everyone else was much older.

"“Been anywhere this spring? Well yes we have.” And there will be some changes because of it!
I love New York City, and this trip didn’t dampen that for me. But there was certainly a part that could have been better. 
I always believe in ending on a high note, so let me plunge to the not so good. It’s time to make a change from my travel service. I’ve used EXPEDIA for a very long time. Many, many trips. And it’s always been pretty convenient. But there have been some hotel setups along the way that threatened to spoil those trips. 
I’ve come to understand that Expedia does a poor job in looking at the hotels. Certainly I don’t expect some guy in a Expedia hat and jacket to actually check out every hotel. But they don’t do a good job looking at what the readers call 4 or 5 star hotels—to say nothing about a 3 star. 
We stayed at the Hudson (356 W. 58th St.). Now come on Expedia! You can say boutique, snug and sexy if you want. But you should have said very, very, tiny. Listen to me now, I didn’t write small, I wrote tiny. Like a shoe box. A shoe box for your child. Man!
So small that you had to do mini pirouette shuffle with your hands and arms IN just to sit on the toilet. Your towel hung outside the bathroom near the door to the main hotel hallway! I’m talking tiny. 
When you got out of the bed, you had to skinny down the side of the wall to get to the bath/shower. Only one 110 outlet to plug in your laptop or iPhone. Yet they had a ironing board. (‘Course it blocked the exit door and the bathroom at the same time).
Yes, I did talk to the hotel before the trip started. No, they never used the word tiny. 
Yes, I still love NYC! 
The highlight of the trip that almost made us forget about the hotel: the Oyster Bar Restaurant in Grand Central Station.

"“paying for location...” I was in town for a wedding and stayed at this hotel for three nights. The location is superb and that is essentially what the cost of the room gets you. I've read a lot of feedback in general about the staff at this location, stating that guests found them to be pretentious and/or unhelpful. I did not find that to be the case- the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was actually a bright spot for me. The lobby and the public spaces in this hotel were indeed very 'hip' and quite lovely, if not a bit too darkly lit..I mean, we're talking perpetual midnight in the lobby here. The rooms...this is where you start asking if you're actually getting what you paid for. The rooms were fine, but just that...fine. They've been designed with the idea that you're not going to spend a lot of time in them. They were very sparsely furnished, but to the point where it didn't make sense. The sink didn't have any kind of counter and the main room essentially just had two beds and tiny side tables..simple things like putting on make up and getting ready for all the events we were going to became a bit awkward. The lighting in the room was also very dark and not very practical. Basic amenities like a privacy sign had to be called up for. The room was supposed to include robes, but there were none in our room. The towels were standard, cheap hotel towels and the bathtub stopper did not work. I don't know...if this had been a moderately priced hotel, some of things would not have mattered so much, but because we paid a lot to stay here- we expected more.

Rooms are indeed very small and bathrooms een smaller. On the up, toiletries are great and replenished everyday. The big hustle with this place is the noise mainly due to the club and bars operated by the hotel which gives the impression that entertainment is the core business rather than accommodation. It is really loud and i was on the 9th floor and i could still hear it. Also, many times i've been asked by the doorman of the hotel (who turns literally into a bouncer at night) if i stay at the hotel. Not a very good image in my point of view.

"“Don't Know What The Complaining Is About” Me and my boyfriend have just got back from a week at the Hudson and before I went I checked TripAdvisor for reviews, only to find people say that its 'horrible' and the staff are 'ignorant'...well you get back what you give them because the staff are nothing but nice and are willing to help you with anything! The rooms, yes they are small but what do you expect in NYC. You have space next to the door to fit your suitcase. The cleaners are in every day so when you have been out on a long day sightseeing, you come back to a nice clean room with your bed freshly made. My boyfriend kept telling me to stop worrying about the hotel because i went off other peoples reviews and to be quite honest, he was right by telling me not to worry because it was brilliant. We stayed on the 17th floor overlooking the Times Warner buildings and lit up at night is nice to see every time you close your blinds. It was annoying with sirens going off all the time but no matter where you go you won't get away from that.

"“Hip décor, tiny room, well-located” I had stayed at another Morgans Group hotel (the Clift, in SF) and decided to give this one a go. Both hotels follow the same standard - impressively designed common areas and rooms a bit on the spartan side. Convenient midtown location (in Hell's Kitchen, actually). My room was smaller than the one I had at Clift's, but as the heater didn't work I got upgraded to a considerably bigger one. Service was impersonal. I especially enjoyed the bars - had a great burger while watching the snow fall down at Hudson Hall and great cocktails at the Hudson Bar.",alehmen,2012-02-01,223023,2012-04-20,False,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
“Trying but need to take 2 rooms and turn them into one” Stayed in many hotels in New York but this one is the smallest in town <rooms I mean> Toilet half size need to turn feet sideways to sit .

"“Hudson Hotel - New York” Nice desing and location of the Hotel, near central park.
Rooms are nicely decorated, good be bad the handicap I found is the size of the room. Too small, specially the toilet.
Nonetheless, if you go to NY for tourism you do not want to spend too much time in your hotel, only to rest. Nonetheless, it is a good option to rest.
Windows should be have better isolation as you could here the traffic from your bed. (I was in the highest floors of the hotel).

"“Never Again” We had heard about the Hudson before our stay and knew it had small rooms with great public spaces. We loved the lobby area and the various seating areas. The agent at check in didn't tell us about the restaurant, breakfast, or the fabulous bar. We had to find this out for ourselves. The room was small. We knew to expect that. But it was worn and outdated. There was one outlet to plug in 4 devices. The worst: after my husband used a towel, he found dried blood on it. I talked to housekeeping, then I talked to the front desk and was told the manager would contact us. He/she never did.

"“Really?” We stayed at the Hudson last night. I went in eyes open-- knew the rooms were small. Went based on price (pretty cheap for the neighborhood) and location (CPS). Be aware--the rooms are ridiculous. We live in NYC area and have stayed in many locations in Manhattan. This room was smaller than my college dorm room. It was the bathroom that was really funny. If you sit on the toilet and you are taller than 5'2 your knees will hit the wall in front. The shower is really tight. If you are laying in bed, you can watch your roommate shower as they are behind a wall of glass -open to the 'bedroom'. The entire hotel is bathed in pitch black darkness--lobby, elevators, hallways--which look like my old dorm(metal doors with numbers painted on). Darwin at the front desk was actually quite charming and helpful. My husband and I were there for less than 24 hours and the location is superb! But seriously...no children, know your roommate VERY well, go in eyes open and only go if the rate is $300 or less--or you are seriously being ripped off.

"“Nice lobby and location, but rooms were dark” This hotel was conveniently located in the Columbus Circle area and near the Time Warner Centre and Lincoln Centre was within walking distance. The lobby and particularly the Hudson Bar were very nice -- loved the atmosphere there. But the rooms were extremely dark (the few lights there are so dim! I needed to put my makeup on in the bathroom) hallways are dark, and the beds are small and low to the ground. I guess the good thing was that I got a pretty good night's sleep from being so dark in the room. The plasma TV worked well. One of the people in our group had his money stolen out of his wallet from the room, which was unexpected but then again, I'd strongly advise not to leave any valuables at all out on the desk and make sure your room door closes well. The lifts have access to the rooms without any kind of added security (no need to put the room key in the lift, for example) and it means that a lot of people (hotel and non-hotel) are coming through the hallways. I had an express mail package, and even though it wasn't delivered to my room, when I called the front desk, they were very helpful in tracking it down for me and we eventually found it. I also used a phone card to call overseas and the hotel charged me (a minimum charge, but still a charge) for every time I dialed a 1-800 number. They charge exorbitant amounts for overseas calls so don't call from the hotel -- use Skype or buy a phone card. I had to store my luggage for a few days and the bellboy staff was friendly and efficient.

All in all, the hotel is highly over-rated. Its clear they spent all their time and energy on the hotel lobby, bars and lounges, and no thought into the actual rooms, which is smaller than a shoebox, and the linen actually feels like a plastic table cloth. 
We had two beds in our room, which pretty much took up all the stepping space. Service was eh. NYC has so many amazing hotels, the Hudson is not one of them.

Hotel blends in as there are no signs outside, we did walk past it on our first venture out.

Made a nice change to some hotels that can be a bit too blinding as you walk in.
Rooms were quite small and we had been upgraded, but to be honest we didn't spend a lot of time in the room during the day as we were out seeing the sights.
Breakfast was lovely, had vending machines on each floor, so was great when we fancied a snack.",EmmaLJ13,2011-03-01,223023,2012-02-05,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great for what it is” People moaning about the size of rooms at the Hudson obviously haven't spent much time in NYC hotels which can be put loosely into the following categories. 1) Cheap $50 - $100 and mostly awful, or 2) horribly expensive $450 - $1000 with room to swing a cat.
The Hudson is basically a Lovely lobby, study, Bar and roof with very small rooms that are reasonably kitted out.
Its a clever trick, from the outside and congregating areas its a Boutique hotel and from the lift up its a holiday Inn express with slightly smaller rooms.
All that said the hotel is almost literally on Central Park, opposite Whole Foods and a stroll from great restaurants. Its clean and lively (wouldn't stay there with kids on a Friday or Saturday) The study and breakfast rooms are especially nice and you can get rooms for as cheap as $150.00 which by New Standards is close to as cheap as your going to get.",DavidBianchi,2011-04-01,223023,2012-02-05,False,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Not for the clostraphobic and bring a torch.” Fortunately we booked a Dial 7 to get us to this hotel from the airport or we never would have found it, no sign????? 
Check in was quick & efficient
Concierge always helpful when needed
Couldnt believe how dark the lobby and hallways were. 
Room was smaller than standard rooms on a cruise ship.
I am actually unsure how the ensuite passes OH&S as if you collapsed in it they wouldnt be able to get you out and there is no room for medical personnel if needed.
Location is great.
Room was clean and modern, but poor lighting, cleaned meticulously everyday.
WiFi only free for 24 hours. 
I was most disappointed when I asked for a late check out and they offered me 4 hours for $100, considering I only paid $85 per night for the 7 nights, I thought that over the top and didnt take up the offer.

But, a great location! If you're staying here for a few days and planning on going all over the city, it's a perfect location to get anywhere in in the city.

"“Better Choices” Priceline booked me with the impression this was 3.5 stars. In reality it eas 2.5 at most. It's hard to locate. When you find it, you go up a long escalator to the lobby. Unique and inviting - like a rainforest. 
Checking was simple. Went to my room. So small it reminded me of a cruise ship. lots of wood. Very awkward layout and had a cheap feel. 
During the night, the heat went off and it was cold. Also, the Internet stopped working. I called earlier and there was no response to my complaint. 
I ate at Hudson Hall. Very different. Expensive and forgettable. 
The location is quite nice near Central Park. It is access able to all forms of transportation.

"“Terrible hotel, horrible experience” I stayed at this hotel last month and I disliked everything about it. For a start there is no sign at street level to let you know it is a hotel and you walk through a windy door and immediately have to get on an escalator to get to the lobby. The lobby itself is so dark you can barely see anything - everything in this hotel is dark, dark, dark. It was also extremly noisy - I arrived at night and it was impossible to hear the staff on reception with the noise. The rooms are miniscule and dark excpet for a light in the wardrobe that you cannot actually switch off which is really irritating if you want to sleep in total darkness - the wardrobe does not have a door. I went there with 2 friends and made the mistake of using priceline for which I got 16 percent discount but the room we booked was hardly big enough for one person so we had to book another room the first night and then upgrade to a bigger one (only marginally bigger of course) for a bigger price as well of course. In short, it ended up costing more money than if I had stuck with the full price of a 4 star I had booked as a back up. (I guess this is a priceline issue but nothing was negotiable in the way it mostly is in a 4 star in terms of room etc). The staff stick to a script when talking to you so you can't negotiate anything or talk to anyone other than the script readers. Basically this was the worst place I have ever stayed anywhere for this price and I have nothing to recommend about it. I would never stay here again and don't ever bid for a 3 star on price line or you may end up with this - horrible!",Mary M,2011-12-01,223023,2012-01-27,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Immaculate Room, But the Size of My Closet” I'm NOT kidding. The bedroom area was literally the size of my walk-in closet, which is 9x9; I paced it out. Room for the queen-size bed, a teensy utility table and an uncomfortable chair. The shower was literally 24 inches x 46 inches (I counted the tiles). The (small) toilet left my knees about 6 inches from the wall...and I'm 4'-11""! If I were a left-handed guy, I couldn't have shaved using the sink. My husband, who is 6'-8"" would not have fit in the space at all! It was also 90 degrees when I walked in. I promptly turned on the A.C. to 60, but kept it at 65 during the night, which worked fine for me. The closet consisted of a 2' rod with about half a dozen hangers; the ironing board did NOT hang on the wall, so it kept falling over and I had to set up the luggage rack to keep it away from my clothes, which was quite inconvenient. The luggage rack wouldn't have fit anywhere else, except maybe the miniscule hallway, but one would have tripped over it getting to the bathroom.
More on the funky bathroom. The side of the shower wall consisted of clear glass with a white fabric shower curtain. On the room side, there was a filmy (inexpensive) white nylon curtain. The entrance to the shower was likewise covered by a white fabric shower curtain. 
On the whole, three rooms in this hotel would have made up into two decent-sized rooms, but then again, they couldn't have packed us in like lemmings...NOT that the hotel was anywhere near filled. As I said, I paid only a hundred bucks for my room...the rack rate being about $150. I don't know how packed they are on weekends, but they certainly weren't full during the weekday I was there.
OK those are the negatives. On the plus side, the room was very clean and had lovely linens and a very comfy (if low-slung) bed...more on a futon-style size. A normal height bed would have made the room look even smaller. It was quiet by NYC standards. I was in town overnight for surgery the next day, and for an inexpensive room (you can bid online; I got it for $100) it was quite decent. The neighborhood is also safe, a huge plus. As a former New Yorker, I can tell you it's convenient...close to 57th St., so transportation is decent--crosstown buses, the #5 which goes down 5th Avenue passes nearby, as do 7th Ave. buses (hop one to get to Times Sq.), and uptown 8th Ave. buses. It's also near Columbus Circle (and not far from Lincoln Center) for the #1 local train (7th Ave. IRT) and the A train (8th Ave.). I was too tired to go out for dinner, but the hotel food was decent and ""tres nouvelle."" (See my review for details.)
I'd rate the room size a 1, but the quality of the room a 4, so it averages out to a 2.5-3.
Now more on the hotel, which I found fascinatingly funky. I was probably the oldest patron in the hotel (I'm 64); seems to cater to a late 20's to 30-something crowd, most of whom are techno-trendies (or wannabees). The front of the hotel doesn't look like a hotel...no grand marquee...and you take a long escalator up to the lobby, which is dark, spattered by pools of light. A Grand Chandelier hangs over one of the front desk receptionists, sort of a crystal Sword of Damocles. My receptionist was a nice guy who smirked when I asked if the room was the size of a closet with an air shaft. He told me that the single rooms were smaller. I couldn't possibly .imagine. A bank of elevators off to the east side of the lobby was, likewise, dark. It has about 22 floors and a warren of rooms on each floor. The overriding decor in the hallways was institutional cell grey with white doors. Lots of doors. Lots of little cells. Oh, and the bath ameneties were nice and first-rate. An ok place, but not if you travel in pairs and definitely NOT for families. Nary a child in sight, which in some instances could be considered a blessing. As an aside, I had just paid half the amount for a room at a Red Roof that was 4 times the size...but, hey, that was in Cleveland!",Suziewrite,2012-01-01,223023,2012-01-27,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

“Boutique Bust” I recently stayed over night in this hotel as did a co-worker of mine. The pictures on their website severly oversell this property.

My co-worker and I ended up sharing the same room as we did not feel safe in the hotel. I would never stay at this property again.

Me & my boyfriend (ages 24 & 26) visited from the UK end of July, it was really hot outside so the air con in the room was great. Yes the rooms are small but what do you want, its only somewhere to sleep, it's not like you spend all day in the room you should be out enjoying the sights. The bed was sooo comfy and had no outside noise. The roof terrace was amazing, we often went up to sunbathe on the beds to rest our legs and have a refreshing drink, the bikini/kaftan clad waitresses were so lovely (slightly envious of their figures haha), I was hungover one day and she appeared with a raspberry lemonade...best thing i've drank...real lemonade with mushed up raspberrys yum...sorted the hangover out too!! The bar in the private park was fab aswell the decor was awesome..drinks were expensive but most hotel bars are! Didnt eat in the hotel other than from the vending machines on each floor but plenty of restaurants around.

"“Talks the talk, but can't walk the walk” I found the Hudson to be very impressive on the surface; it all looked very glamourous and filled with pretty people, in a great midtown location (even if it was all a bit tacky - there was a vending machine in the lobby which sold gold coloured hand cuffs, if you're into that sort of thing). 
When I looked a little deeper, however, I was disappointed. My room was tiny and in need of a lot of maintenance - e.g. the front door to my room didn't sit correctly in the door frame & had to be slammed forcefully to keep it shut.

"“You can stay outside for this price” The hotel has a great location, but my first room was so cold, that I became really sick. The stuff was rude (with the exceptions of managers who were very understanding and polite). After spending one night in a room with about 50 degrees I was offered another room, however an engineer came and found that the window was simply open the whole night in the old room. Yes, this happened after all my complaints to the stuff who did not bother to look at the room.
Next room has a window, and after some arguments with the stuff I insisted that the engineer would check if the window is closed. It was for a while, but the window is fragile, almost non-existence, and next morning the temperature was so cold inside that the stuff even did not want to enter. Again, the manage is much better, more polite and understanding and agreed to refund two night out of four, but tis is nothing comparing to severe cold or pneumonia one can get in this hotel.
A cup of hot tea will cost you five dollars.

I was there for a 3-night stay. On the first night, the air-conditioner/heater was making so much noise that I only got 3 hours of sleep. The next morning, I spoke with the front desk, requesting that they fix it. By evening when I return to my room, the problem improved but still too noisy. So I went down to the front desk to see how we can solve this because I need my sleep! The front desk person, Olivia, was very apologetic. She changed my room and even gave me an upgrade to a slightly larger room. This time around, the room was perfect. It is still small -- but adding even just a foot of space all around makes a huge difference. I will defintely return to the Hudson for the excellent customer service and great location.

"“Smallest room in the world” My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hudson one weekend when we decided on a whim to spend one more night in Manhattan. If you've ever spent time at the Hudson, you know that the Library bar has a great vibe and the lobby is dripping with atmosphere. But the rooms? Wow! Our queen ""deluxe"" was literally the smallest room in the world! Only one person can move around comfortably at a time. Having said that, the room had it's charms. The bedroom area was like a paneled room from a cruise ship with mirrors on both walls and a flat screen mounted on one of them. The bed was comfy but if you're looking for a good night sleep, you probably won't find it here. From the 14th floor, we heard every car horn and siren on 9th Avenue. Lastly, the hallways need a refresh and smell like smoke. Would we stay here again? Only if we got the same deal we found on a low cost travel site.

"“This place is AWFUL.” Definitely NOT a 3.5 star, as advertised on Priceline. The rooms are ridiculously small (not even enough space to do pushups on the floor without my elbows hitting the wall). It barely accomodates the bed (with a foot to spare on each side). You have to climb on top of the bed just to open the one window. I'm fit, not fat, but I was still scraping against the bathroom doorway when going into and out of the bathroom. Don't expect any amenities like fridge, microwave, or even a coffee maker... they aren't here!! The desk is smaller than a 2x4 and the chair is a cheap, hard, aluminum chair. The shower only has a glass partition between the actual shower and the bed area. THIS HOTEL SHOULD BE BARRED FROM PRICELINE, OR SHOULD HAVE ITS STAR RATING LOWER TO 1 OR 2 STARS. Even more aggravating, I received numerous ""price alerts"" from Priceline saying that there are other 3 and 4 star hotels in Midtown for under $80/night. I've stayed at numerous other 3 star hotels in Midtown and the rooms were all much bigger and much nicer. No free coffee downstairs here either (it is $5 in the breakfast restaurant). This place is really more a ""hostel,"" not a ""hotel."" Also, most of the towels had hair on them or were stained. The first room I was given had a lock on the door which was half-broken (could be opened by inserting something into the door frame).

"“Not Horrible, But Not Great” Our room was decent. The beds were comfortable, which is important to me because I am post back surgery. The pillows were lacking. The hotel hallways were extremely dark, dingy and reeked of cigarette smoke although we had a non-smoking room. Our bathroom, while small was functional. We had a double double, so not as small as the single, which from what I have read is really small. Our bathroom tile really needed to be re-grouted. It had some mold and was mostly grey. We had to ask for the maid to bleach the heck out of it before we felt comfortable showering. I didn't like that the windows had only light blinds and sheers. Even with the blinds closed it was still too light and made it hard to sleep. The AC was at the head of the bed and made your head extremely cold, however the rest of your body was hot. It was fairly quiet though. The safe wasn't working and wasn't bolted to the shelf so we called the front desk numerous times over three days before they sent someone up from security to take a look at it. Security brought up a new safe but couldn't fasten it down because that was a maintenance issue. Maintenance never did come fasten it to the shelf.

"“Greatest location, cool style, bad space/people ratio, smallest rooms” I can’t think of a better location to stay at while in NYC. Within 100 meters (300 ft) you find such things as the Central Park, the Lincoln Center, Fordham University, and the nicest specialty shops. Even on the very same sidewalk you find a few have-it-all delis, an ultimate-taste sushi place, a pharmacy, a theater, a club, and so forth. 
And this is without a doubt a one-of-a-kind styled hotel; astonishingly modern and sophisticated in every single corner outside in, which does not bore you even after seeing it several days in a row. The internal patio is worth a visit more than a couple of times.
Staff is really kind and willing to help in all matters. From the receptionists to the maintenance people answer to questions and request with an honest smile and a smart joke. 
One of the problems might be that too many people like the hotel, and the hotel like too many people. So it is basically crowded 24/7: a line for checking-in, a line for checking-out, a line for luggage picking, and an incredible never-less-than-5-full-minute wait for an elevator to come (two elevators being out of service might have been the main cause). And it gets so noisy at the super fancy lobby and bar that it is impossible to hold a normal conversation there. A curious note is that the complete darkness that decorates the common areas’ ambiance forces everyone to walk or seat around carefully, for them not to bump onto people or things. 
The rooms do not match the cool style of the hotel. They are so small that you can’t fit more than three or four suits into the hole-in-the-wall, no-door wardrobe. Beds, pillows, and overal furniture are of the worst quality I’ve seen at a hotel this price. 
In conclusion, I’m glad I stay at the Hudson just as I could be glad about having visited a design showroom at the most convenient location.

"“Brilliant location and extraordinarily well appointed: Perfection.” This hotel is my idea of perfection despite the pocket sized rooms. It felt opulent, stylish and heavenly. We treasured every moment of our 4 nights here. The library bar is an extraordinary dream, the terrace bars (both on the mezzanine level and on the roof-top) are some of the most ambient I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying: just pay the money for an exquisite cocktail and drink it as slowly as you can, so you can soak up the public spaces for as long as possible.
 I cherished every crevice of this accomplished space. The dark wood pannelled walls of our room and all the mirrors created the feel of a sexy captain's master suite on a romantic and masculine ship from a story-book. I even loved the elevator interiors, the hallways and the bathrooms, the light fittings and all the over-sized sculptures and plant pots. Phillip Stark excelled himself here and even the other guests were super cool, but in a warm and smiling way. I've stayed at many hotels before and after this that have tried to pull off this style, but none have achieved it like the Hudson has. The lobby is a work of art with the vine clad atrium above, and all the red brick work is so tactile and warming. Staying here makes you feel like you have truly 'arrived'. It doesn't matter what it cost, because it was worth every hard earned cent to stay there for 4 nights of extreme urban grooviness. 
That said, I guess you have to know who you are to stay here and embrace it, as it might be a bit intimidating for the faint-hearted and you absolutely have to appreciate post-modern high end, experimental interior design and feel enchanted by dark spaces interspersed with carefully selective lighting. You also have to be completely comfortable with the experience of being surrounded by stunning model types, hip professional types and the occasional rap star. I loved it.
The location is brilliant; just a skip down the street from Central Park and MOMA, the MET and all the posh stores, and around the corner from the character-rich Hells Kitchen, with its street markets that run for a dozen city blocks, and countless multicultural cheap eats.

"“Quirky, Stylish and Petit!” I can understand why some people don't like this hotel. If you book a standard room you will end up with a very small room. For my wife and I (early thirties) this was fine and actually quite cosy but I could understand you need to be of a certain mindset to enjoy this room and hotel.
To start with the hotel is perfectly located, only a 15 minute walk from Times Square, a couple of minutes from a supermarket and subway station (St Christopher's) and a fixed $45 ride from JFK (about an hour journey).
If you are travelling from Newark Airport - we took the train from the Airport to Penn (30 minutes) and then a cab from there ($10).
The room is of decent quality, just everything in the standard room is a little tight. To be honest if you were of the larger build you would struggle to sit on the toilet or stretch in the shower!
We quite liked the room and the atmosphere of the hotel and would return if we were in New York. Beware it can get noisy at times with the noise of the streets and the club - this is New York though! Staff are great. 
If you want a bigger room, then stop complaining and pay for a bigger room! We ate breakfast in the hotel once and although it was good it was overpriced and better is available locally.

"“Style over substance” This hotel is very chic and modern but is not a place for weary travellers. The rooms are tiny, with child sized beds in them. The bathroom was so small and the divide between the bedroom and bathroom is a show curtain so their is no privacy. Even by New York standards the room sizes were very small. The hotel has dim mood lighting through out which adds to the sense that you have been buried alive. We checked in and checked out again within half an hour. We were due to take a long flight the next day and could not see how we could get a decent nights sleep in such a small bed. We are not big people but even we felt squashed. On the upside the hotel is clean, the reception staff were helpful and it would be a suitable place to stay for singles or people gong clubbing all night who don't care about the bed size.

"“Shoebox style in a great location” My friend and I booked an amazing deal at the Hudson - and I'd definitely advise looking out for these, and NOT paying full price. We paid £500 for 3 nights in a standard double, which is a great price considering the location of the hotel. The room was definitely the smallest room I've ever seen, but that just encouraged us to spend no time in it other than what was necessary - i.e. sleeping and showering! If you don't mind living out of a suitcase, which you have to climb over to navigate around the room, then you'll be fine! 
The location of the hotel is great - walking distance to the park, to MoMA and to a tonne of great bars and restaurants around Hell's Kitchen. 
The hotel lobby is super-cool, you definitely feel it's an incredibly stylish place when you first walk in. Same goes for the bar - excellent cocktails, and the 'restaurant', which is more of a canteen, and which is rather expensive, but I suppose could be handy if you just want to grab a quick bite to eat before heading somewhere else. I personally would still recommend heading to one of the plethora of local places for no doubt better food at a guaranteed more reasonable price. 
The staff were helpful and friendly, one annoyance is that we were promised a room upgrade by one of the hotel managers (I took e-mail proof of this with me!) and unfortunately, despite mentioning this on check-in, we didn't get said upgrade. That said, as we had paid such a good rate I wasn't overly bothered - if I'd paid rack rate I definitely would've been unimpressed.
In short, if you just want a base, in a stylish environment in a great location, I couldn't recommend anywhere more than The Hudson and I'd definitely stay again!",tomchalet,2011-11-01,223023,2012-01-06,False,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Small Rooms but Overall Great!” Tip #1: if you go through Priceline be leary. Got this hotel after my first try at their 'name your price' option. Ended up getting it for like $10 less per night than regular rate & it's not a hotel I would have chosen on my own, purely for the size of the rooms as well as the reviews. (I put in a max of ~$200 per night and 3.5 stars in the area). 
However, that being said, and after reading so many bad reviews, I was pleasantly surprised! We went to NY for a quick weekend getaway right before Christmas, so anymore than a quick trip and I think the small room and rediculously small bathroom would have driven me crazy! (I read a review on this site that said your knees actually touch the wall when sitting on the toilet, and it is by no means an exaggeration. 100% true!)
Other than the room size, we loved the hotel. Great location, all staff were overly friendly and super helpful, always clean in the room. Plus, the room itself looked to be (fairly) newly renovated.

"“Sketchy bellhops, weathered hallways and tiny bathrooms ruin hip hotel” SKETCHY BELLHOPS!!
My stay was below expectations. Still, I didn't think about complaining until I dealt with the bellmen. First, as our bellman led us to the curb, he yells to another Hudson bellhop standing about 10-20 ft away, ""Hey, do that funny Chinese voice, you do."" The other bellhop doesn't respond so our bellhop continues by saying something along the lines of, ""Me have no money"" with what sounds like his version of a Chinese accent. It was particularly strange because my wife and I are both Asian. This made me uneasy, but it's what followed that drove me to write a negative review.
We told the bellhop that we were going to LaGuardia. A cab pulled up and the bellhop approached the cab. Before we were able to get close to the cab, the same cab drove off and when we asked why it left, the bellhop told us the cab driver didn't want to drive to Queens. Of course this is strange since under the Driver Rule 54-20, it is against the law to refuse a person based on destination so long as it is within the five boroughs. A few seconds later, a cab came, the bellman approached the cab and then waived us and the bellman with our bags over. Once we got into the cab, we asked the driver what's wrong with Queens, is the traffic bad? He laughed instantly and said there was nothing wrong with traffic, but the bellman asked for $2 and he gave it to the bellman. Based on the driver's reaction it seemed like a common practice at Hudson and maybe even throughout the city. I would have just dismissed this explanation from the cab driver except I noticed the previous day a bellhop approaching a cab, talking to the cab driver for several seconds and then telling him to get lost and to continuing driving even though hotel guests were clearly waiting for a cab. 
I left a message for the Hudson manager but no reply after one work day.
Why did the bellhops' scam bother me so much?
1. All employees are extensions of the hotel. If the bellhop undermines his service to you for a $2 vig from the cab driver, do you feel good about leaving your personal belongings in the hotel room? Do you feel good about changing or showering without concern that there is a peephole somewhere? Once we got to the airport, my wife and I opened our bags and had to check to make sure nothing was stolen.
2. It could have harmed an innocent party. If I reported what was probably an innocent cab driver under the Refusal Law, he still may have been on the hook for a $200-$350 fine.
3. Nobody likes to get ripped off. Even though it only cost me a few seconds of my time, it does not change the fact that Hudson subsidizes their bellhop paychecks by playing tourists for fools.
SUMMARY
Hudson hotel is a great place to go for drinks, but it is really a NYC budget hotel with a very very hip common area. Considering that I only paid around $350 for New Year's Eve (other hotels charged $400+), maybe I can't expect too much from the place, but the heat did not work properly and the front desk didn't answer my phone call when I tried to report the problem (first time that I've called a hotel front desk with no answer). BUT, worst of all were the bellboys on my way out. It is a shame because the front desk people were energetic and friendly.
PROS:
Nice location, very hip decor and cool vibe in the common areas. Front desk people were friendly and energetic.
CONS: 
Some sketchy bellhops, tiny smelly bathroom and weathered hallway carpets. I've visited HK , Tokyo and other NYC hotels and this bathroom was the smallest I've seen. On my floor, several of the rooms' frames had pry indentations from forced entry. Maybe this was done by hotel management, but it still created some uneasiness.",Larry L,2011-12-01,223023,2012-01-03,False,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great hotel... small rooms!” Stayed here for a 5 night break before Christmas after having been to this hotel previously for dinner and drinks on a previous visit to New York. Its one of those hotels where you have to know its there to know its there, with a bare concrete front and a fluorescent entrance with an escalator taking you up to the main foyer. Very discreet and cool. Big entrance foyer with a separate concierge area and large glass windows giving you a view out into the garden area.
We stayed up on the 15th floor (the higher the better in New York as the lower floors can be really noisy due to how busy the city is). Our room was nice, well equipped but extremely small. That small in fact that we were unable to have both suitcases out at the same time. We had a regular queen room. 
Once you get over how small the room what is apparant is that you get a really nice bed, high quality bed linen, very effective air conditioning and a nice Sony LCD tv with full cable tv and an Ipod dock. Plug sockets are very limited so be warned if your charging phones, laptops, using hair dryers etc.
Bathroom again tiny, barely big enough to get in and close the door, but good toiletries, nice towels and a powerful shower.
If your holiday revolves around staying in the room then your best off looking else where. If howerver you want a crashpad to see the city then this is perfect as its only 10 minutes walk from Times Square and 5 minutes from Columbus circle. Because its on a cross street its far quieter than staying on one of the main north south routes.
Staff excellent, really friendly and relaxed. Superb bar / library room with a good mixologist. In all fairness this library bar is one of the nicest areas of the hotel and it is worth a visit before heading out for the night, or a drink after a hard day seeing the city. There is also another main bar, and whilst it looks very cool its not terribly comfortable. If its a standing drink with friends you want however then it gets very busy on a friday and saturday night and plays some excellent music so definately worth checking out.
Concierge superb.. knew lots of great local places to eat.",flumph77,2011-12-01,223023,2011-12-30,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Good location” As far as locations go I thought this hotel was in a great spot. Walking distance to many of the attractions on NY and right next to a Subway which can take you anywhere. Staff were always polite and helpful. Rooms were clean but extremely small. There was very little room between the wall and bed. Toilet faced wall very closely, which may be difficult for larger people. One downfall with the Hudson was the sleep quality. Our first room faced the road and there were road works all night (not that this was anything to do with the hotels its self). I called reception and they were great and agreed to move us to another room the next night. The next night alarms went in the middle of the night, we called reception and they assured us every thing was ok and to stay in the room. The night after that the air con stopped working and the room was like an oven, at 1.30am reception sent someone from maintenance to fix this. The night after that there was a party in the lobby which went to the wee hours in the morning. If you are a heavy sleeper then you will be fine at this hotel, not so good for light sleepers. If I was in NY again I would most likely stay upper east or west side where the accommodation is a little less costly as the subway is so easy and quick to get around in. Sleep quality really was the only downfall for me. The location was perfect and staff were great but don't think I would stay here again. There were a number of elevators but seemed as if only one worked.",Charlsie78,2011-10-01,223023,2011-12-30,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great hotel for young couples and groups” My partner and I stayed at the Hudson hotel between Xmas and new year. Upon arrival we were greeted with a friendly warm welcome at reception by a top guy James. 
If you do your research before hand you know the rooms are going to be on the small side..... But that's to be expected for a good location in the city. I've stayed in smaller in Mayfair, London. Our room was clean and decorated in cool decor. There is room for you to store stuff and move around. My only downside would be if you keep the curtains drawn the room can be a little dark for getting ready. The bed was extremely comfy and you get a dovet which many other hotels don't offer. Location was brilliant- opposite central park, the subway is 2 minutes away and time square is only a 5 min walk. The best part of this hotel for young people in the cool and funky Hudson bar. It has a neon floor, plays good music and offers an array of drinks at a reasonable price ( remember this is ny so $25 for 2 drinks is acceptable)
I would recommend the Hudson to any of my friends visiting ny who want a clean hotel, good location and nightlife at their doorstep.

"“Expect a good 3* and you'll be happy” The hotel is in a nice location for some shops, central park, and eating in Hell’s Kitchen. It also felt like a safe area to walk around in at night.
We went prepared as friends had warned us the hotel rooms are tiny (which they are). As long as you go knowing this you can’t be too disappointed. Hotel staff on the whole were very good to excellent, with the exception of one rogue receptionist who seemed to be missing a trick, although she was always polite.
Corridors and rooms could do with a bit of a refresh. The gym was a reasonable with good equipment. There is no mini-bar in the room, nor a fridge to keep any food or drinks bought chilled – which for this type of hotel, should be standard. The safe was on a shelf six and half feet off the floor which made it very difficult (or dangerous depending on what you decide to stand on) to access.
With the expectation of a good 3* hotel with small rooms, I would be happy. On this basis, I would recommend.",Ben500,2011-12-01,223023,2011-12-28,False,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Style A+, Practicality C” Very stylish, fairly 'high design' hotel in decent location (block from Central Park South, Columbus Circle, Time-Warner Center). Although I'm seasoned in NYC hotels and used to small rooms, this place was extreme in that regard. The room was beyond small. The bathroom was similar to one you might find on a small cabin-cruiser boat.

"“""Modern"" Gone Horribly Wrong!” This place was built in 1928 as a dormitory for teenage girls and young women in New York. The average sized woman then was 4'11"" and weighed 82 pounds. That's what this dormitory was originally was built for. 
In 1997, Morgan Hotel company took over and added a new facade, paint, flooring, and some modern bath products and called it a ""boutique"" hotel. 
The rooms, bathrooms, showers, and toilets are miniature by today's standards. If you are over 5-feet tall, your knees will press into the wall in front of you when sitting on the toilet. I am attaching a photo of the toilet proximity to the wall. A coat hanger touching the wall is used for perspective. Note the tile is 4-inch tile. You have 10"" between the toilet seat and the wall. 
The front desk staff are friendly, but have no power to get anything done. Problems simply do not get resolved. 
I have always stated in previous reviews that problems happen at all levels of hotel. What sets quality hotels apart from poorly run hotels is the way hotel management deals with these issues. Unfortunately, the Hudson Morgan Hotel is apparently poorly managed because problems do not get resolved during one's stay. This is not atypical. If you read previous reviews, people who had a problem with this hotel were never satisfied with the resolution. 
Our problems included a thermostat that did not work and a bathroom sink that did not drain. The front desk said they would send an engineer to the room to fix – but three days later and as many calls later, nothing had been done. They also said they would relocate us to another room, but called us later in the day telling us that no other rooms were available.
One common theme among approximately half of the reviews is that rooms were not ready upon check-in. We arrived at 8:30 PM. Although the hotel states that check-in time is at 3:00, our room was not ready at 8:30 PM. We waited an hour and a half before our room was ready for us to check in. (FYI - it had been booked three months prior).
As you stand in the lobby and listen to the front desk staff speak to hotel guests, you'll continuously hear the words ""I'm sorry."" This hotel is so old and in such bad need of renovation that virtually every room and every guest seems to have a problem. They are unable to react quickly enough to satisfy the guests.
The renovation done in 1997 is showing its age. Additionally, it was a band-aid and not a deep bones renovation. This hotel still has the original 1927 plumbing, toilets, closets, and rooms. Remember, this was built as a dormitory for young women. When it was made into a hotel, it should have been completely redesigned. It wasn't, however. The structure/bones of the layout stayed the same.
This hotel is a glorified hostel with nice bath products.
Note that the hotel website shows lots of photos of the lobby, but almost no photos of the guest rooms.

First, the location was amazing; 1 block from central park and a 10 min walk to times square/rockefeller center. The staff was so friendly and helpful and the hotel is gorgeous! Spend the extra money and get a room other than the standard. That room is way too small so we upgraded and was well worth it.

"“Very Good Staff, Poor Infrastructure, Party-palooza” Our experience at the Hudson was mixed. Every time we interacted with the staff we had a good experience. Staff members were helpful, kind and friendly.
However, the hotel needs some work. It looks pretty, but we had issues with the drain in our shower, the shower made a horrendous noise, and we eventually had to change rooms because the compressor on our heating and cooling unit gave out, which made it 80 degrees in our room. The rooms are quite small, but if you've looked at other reviews you should know that.
The place is also tragically hip. There's no sign, which is fine if you know what you're (not) looking for, but Saturday is a big party night.

"“great lobby & bar, tiny rooms, flashlight neeeded” I stayed twice at the Hudson. First when in NY on business during Fashion Week. Had booked a single and yes, it was a single. Small room, tiny desk, but I was not there often so no problem. Bar was great, crowd too. Two years later, traveling from Chicago I booked a double for my wife and me. What a dissapointment. To my surprise the ""double"" was even smaller than the single. We were on a 2 week trip and had a lot of luggage, so hardly no space left to move. We also had to ask for another room on a higher floor since the noise from the patio restaurant was incredible. Couldn't sleep alt all.

"“TINY, but trendy and in a prime location” The room is itty bitty, but if you can get past that, you might really like this hotel! It's design and ambiance is super trendy (and so is the staff for that matter). It just has has a young, minimalist vibe. The location is prime -- It's right by Columbus Circle and a few blocks from the Broadway theaters, Times Square and Central Park. For $322 a night, it's a good price for NYC in December.
Back to the room though... It's a bachelor, can't be more than a couple hundred square feet. There's not much room to walk around, but the set up looks cool and clean (hardwood floors, white curtain room separator). The bed is very low (I know it would do damage to my parents' knees if they stayed there!). My big complaint is that the heater/AC is right behind the bed and makes a ruckus when it turns on and off. Its growling sound woke me up a few times and it's kind of scary.
There is no room service (if you like that kind of thing), but there is a restaurant and plenty of eateries nearby. Drinks at the bar -- forget it!

"“Really friendly and helpful staff conseirge very useful overall pretty nice place to stay” After reading some of the reviews of this place I felt very apprehensive after booking to stay for four nights. However upon arrival the security staff at the door took our bags to the bellman who took them to our room while we checked in. A good start we thought. Checking in was nice and simple although they wanted to take a $100 a night deposit and a credit card, tell them you have neither if you don't want to pay this as we did, they weren't too bothered, just means you can't charge anything to the room but don't reccomend this as hotel service is normally well overpriced anyway. 
The room on the first night was as expected enough room to fit a double bed and an en-suite and not all lot else, the room was however clean the heating worked the bathroom was newish and the tv had all the channels you could want there was free wifi but don't expect to stream a film only get limited bandwidth. Having said this didn't go to New York to stay in watching tv or a film on my laptop was good to be able to find places and to book things to do (recommend to beat the crowds). 
On the second day we were happily upgraded to a suite which was double in size had a bigger bathroom with a bath and again room was very clean and tidy.
As mentioned earlier the conseirge desk was very helpful and we were able to print out pre booked tickets using iPads they had at the desk they also told us where good places to go were whilst we were looking around.
Can't review the food at the hotel as we never ate at it. There is a bar which on Friday and Saturday nights gets quite busy and if you are on the lower floors can be heard but this wasn't that much of a problem as we were on the 11th floor.
Checking out is at 12 on the day you depart and was easy but as our flight wasn't until 6 the hotel was able to keep our bags in safe storage until we were ready to go to the airport they security guy hailed a cab and loaded our bags.

"“Rooms are too small” Nice hotel in a good location, short walk from times square. If you want to spend alot of time at the hotel when visiting new York this hotel is no good for you as the rooms are stupidly small. Staff are helpful and friendly. The inside is so dark you can hardly see anyone, several Guests tripped over stools because they couldn't see them as it was so dark. We mainly used the hotel as somewhere just to sleep rather than for anything this else as we spent 12-15 hours of the day out exploring and really only came back to sleep. For this purpose te hotel was good. However the rooms were still very small and didn't deserve the price they were charging for them. Overall, if you want somewhere sleek, fashionable with a close proximity to major attractions in new York and you don't mind having a tiny box room then this is the hotel for you.

"“What a disappointment” My wife and I landed in New York for the final leg of our honeymoon tour and very quickly wished we hadn't bothered. We were greeted on the street by a bellboy who insisted on taking our bags despite my assurances I could manage. The reason why was quickly evident. After checking in and arriving upstairs to be totally underwhelmed by the room, the bags arrived. We had been in the country for less than two hours and had virtually no cash on us at all. When the bellboy realised he wasn't getting a tip, he turned and stormed out of the room, slamming the door as he went. This is a place where the guys outside openly count their tips on the street and joke loudly about what they have, or haven't, been given.
A bottle of wine we had requested in advance to be in the room wasn't there, there was nothing to drink - not even water. The room was small, dark, dingy and depressing, full of Ikea furniture. Large cracks in the ceiling looked like they had been plaster-filled by an child with no arms, and huge strands of dust blew in the breeze from the noisy air-conditioning unit. The bathroom turned into an ice rink within 30 seconds of the shower being turned on and paint was peeling from the radiator, which was stone-cold and full of air.
But the best was still to come. The second night, I went down to the Library Bar for a drink while my wife got ready. I ordered a bottle of beer, handed over a $10 bill and was sarcastically told as I took my change that service was not included in that. Now, I've got no problem tipping anyone for good service, but there's something wrong when a surly 20-year-old brat behind the bar feels he deserves extra for reaching into a fridge and taking the top off a bottle.
There is a horribly-misplaced arrogance about the whole place that seems totally unjustified. The lobby area is beautifully designed but that quality just does not extend upwards to the rooms and is certainly not reflected in the attitude of the majority of staff (front desk excluded). The Hudson is a confused hotel, far too concerned with showing off at the expense of good customer service, which is a real shame because the location is excellent.

"“overpriced hostel” Would not recommend this hotel. It's a glorified hostel. I bought a package that came with a free upgrade if available. But the room styles listed on the website did not include the room we were ""upgraded"" to. The website lists standard rooms, studio, loft, apartment, and penthouse. I asked ""so if I book a studio and a loft is available we move to the loft."" ""Yes"" was the response. I got there and they put us in a ""deluxe studio"" which was no different than the studio and much less impressive than the website made it out to be. The heater didn't work and the mattress was brutal. I told the front desk this and I didn't feel we got a real upgrade so they switched our rooms to a true loft where the heater worked and a better mattress but no bigger or nicer than the other. They told us to pack and they would take the luggage to the new room for us. We were out for 6 hours and when we returned, we got our key and our bags were not in the new room. I called repeatedly and it took them just under an hour to get us our bags. This made us late to the concert we went to new york to see and gave us no chance to grab any food. I explained this to the hotel at check out as well as the fact that the shower in our room sounded like a woman shreeking (""its an old building and we are renovating"" was the response I got, no mention of renovating on the website). I also explained that the room rate on my bill was more than I was quoted at the time of booking. The concession I got for all the trouble and inconveniences was for them to give me the original rate I was quoted. They acted like they were doing me a big favor, Not surprising given how rude the bar staff was. The bars and restaurant were also closed one night for a private party which was also not on the website or told to me when I called to book. These are big selling points for the hotel so I think that should have been made clear before the day they were closed after we checked in. Horrible experience. Much better options in midtown and elsewhere. If you want a hostel type of room and experience with a little manhattan gift wrapping at the bars you might like the standard rooms.

"“Communal areas are great- rooms are TINY” My husband was on business so we decided to extend the trip and make it a family holiday; we brought our baby daughter and stayed a week. The communal areas are very nice- the lobby, bar and restaurant are very impressive. Rooms are incredibly small. My husband knocked his head badly against the TV while getting out of bed. The AC was very dodgy- it was too hot and when we complained, they 'fixed' it and it only blew out cold air. At that point, we were near the end of the week so didn't bother with moving to another room. 
In summary:
Good points- Great location; very clean room; friendly staff; communal areas; Malin & Goetz toiletries
Negatives- AC; tiny rooms; completely unsuitable for families; no room service; very expensive vending machines. Stock up on water, snacks etc at CVS and the Europan Deli around the corner

"“Smallest room I have ever stayed in, poorly equipped” 1st room allocated on arrival: had a gap the size of my hand between the window panes, creating cold draft in the room and terrible noise from the street. Shocking to find this in a room costing nearly $400 a night. Immediately asked to be moved to another room.
2nd room: light behind bed did not work, no TV channels worked, light by desk didn't work, iPod dock didn't work. Complained to front desk. TV fixed but lights and iPod dock not fixed for duration of my stay. Room was so small I smashed my head on the TV when getting out of bed leading to bleeding. Bathroom so small I could hardly sit on the toilet. Only 1 electrical socket in the whole room - so couldn't charge both laptop and phone at the same time. No room service and no documentation about the area. Outrageous that a room of this sub-standard was being charged at nearly $400 pn. Never intend to visit again.

"“My new favorite hotel” I got a deal online and loved every minute of my stay here. It's the perfect hotel for a solo traveler, but I wouldn't recommend it for families-- unless they have significantly bigger rooms available. For example, a huge window separated my bed from the bathroom. There was also about 2 feet around the bed on all sides (aside from the wall side. However, as a solo traveler this made no difference to me.) I also enjoyed the daily free water and champagne in the entrance from the street level.

"“Wow... this was THE worst hotel stay I have EVER had!” I really should have paid closer attention to the negative reviews here. They are spot on. From dark, dirty hallways, to chipping paint on the doors to the rooms to the inexcusably small rooms - this was a huge MESS from the get go. We changed rooms THREE times only to find each one more awful than the next. In all seriousness, the room is the size of a cell. The most clausterphobic experience I have ever had (and I've traveled extensively throughout the world). The shelves in the bathroom were coming off the wall and the grout was peeling in the tub. The cheap curtains throughout the room (?!?) were stained and torn. The 3 inch by 8 inch ""desk"" was broken as if they had pulled it out of the garbage. No room service. Nothing. I was shocked that I spent close to $400/nt for this. It was a complete rip-off and I'm obviously really angry about it.
It seems that this hotel is ready to be sold and not renovated as they have allowed it to fall into COMPLETE disrepair.

"“Glitzy public areas hiding cramped shabby rooms” As is the trend with hotels in Manhattan, Hudson has some really attractive public areas but rubbish rooms. The staff are the really attraction of this hotel though, reception and the concierge desk were very good, porters were even better. 
Frustratingly on our last day we tried to get a drink while wait for our car but were unable to as the bar was shut and the other areas had be closed for a private function. 
The room was minute, and the decor was boutique but was hugely let down by the poor condition -everything just seemed a bit tired. The windows didn't open and the ventilation was to noisy to have on. 
The worst part of the room was the bathroom, it had the charm of a public restroom, absolutely no concession to style or comfort while the window between the bathroom and the bedroom was interesting it was not a welcome addition as there are no circumstances under which I wish to see my nearest and dearest sitting on the toilet.",plc1976,2011-11-01,223023,2011-12-13,False,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“A tiny poorly equipped hotel room” When i booked this hotel for an evening out with my wife and i we were not prepared for how small the room would be. Especially after we had paid an extra $80 for a larger ""king""room.
It was not only tiny, but uncomfortable and poorly equipped. No minibar, no bottles of water, no coffee. There were vending machines on the floor that i used in the morning to purchase some juice. I felt like i had paid $500 for a motel in Newark.
I tried to call room service and got a message saying that there was no room service available, i then called front desk and there was no answer.
With the exception of the bell staff i found the staff in general to be far too arrogant for 20 years of age.

"“Trendy hotel but beware of the small rooms” Stayed at the hotel for a company meeting. Checking in was easy, as was checking out. Everything in between those two events wasn't exactly unpleasant, but then again it wasn't particularly nice... although the stay was definitely memorable. On first entering the room, I realized that the room was small... so small that it was described by many work associates as claustrophobic. The dark walls are about 2 feet wider than the bed. Note that another interesting feature of the hotel is the clear glass separating the shower from the bedroom. The window can be obscured by a thin curtain pulled from inside the shower. So yes - that brings up the bathroom... you can hardly move. Sitting on the toilet, your knees touch the wall. Interestingly enough, however, the amenities are pretty nice. Which brings me to the other point... once you get over the fact that everything in your room is small, you can have a fun time in the hotel. It is nice, clean, with trendy bars... steps away from the Time Warner center, Columbus Circle, Central Park, and lots of other sites in Midtown West. You can find nice restaurants, places to shop, and things to do. If you are looking for more of a gritty New York City feel (and maybe larger room), I might recommend going farther down into midtown (or lower) - even somewhere around Times Square or Rockefeller Plaza. Otherwise, the Hudson is a decent location in the area if you can deal with some of the down sides.",Chris B,2011-12-01,223023,2011-12-11,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“A little improvement, but many of the same problems” This was our fourth stay at The Hudson, due to their competitive constant availability in the discount sites and the great hotel location, in upper midtown west, close to Central Park, Bdway, etc. We had major problems with our last stay, like not being able to check in before 8 pm(!), what didnt happen this time(maybe because is was Monday and the hotel seemed quieter). But as it is usual at the Hudson, the first room they give you is always a wreck: this time it was a room with no locks(!!), what first did not let us lock the room, and thant has locked us out with all our stuff inside the room, what made us go back down and ask for another room. The next room was ok, small as we know all rooms are at this property, and we managed to survive with the lack of space for a long ten days stay. Another special remark is that The Hudson Hotel managers and even the Morgans Group personnel doesn't even bother to answer emails anymore, what makes me really perplex with the total lack of respect towards customers. The managers posts answers in the TA after they receive a bad review and than they couldn't care less if you are going back there expecting to have a better experience.

"“I should have followed other reviewers” Historically I had heard good things about this place but something must have dramatically changed. 
My room was paid upfront and on check in I was asked for a card, I was about to hand one over when I checked they would be ok with me settling the bill at the end in cash to avoid all the UK bank charges. At that point they admitted they we're going to put a charge on my card for $200, meaning that it would be unavailable to me whilst I was staying there. The worse this was there was nothing for me to spend it on, there's no minibar, room service and the bar was hired out for private use any time I wanted to use it. It was simply to cover any potential damage. As it was late at night I explained I would rather pay in cash to avoid the charges from my bank for their stupid poilcy and would drop it in the next day. Whe I did so I was told it was now $400, $100's deposit per night above and beyond the room rate. I explained that I had already been told $200 and wasn't prepared to give them $400. They finally gave way but it just seemed like a scam. This is an absurd policy for a hotel which charges $450 per night during the Christmas season, they should know better.
My first room wasn't clean enough for a family B&B let alone a city hotel. With someone's hair throughout the bathroom (in sink/shower/shelf/soap dish etc), a bath lacking about 25% of it's enamel/paint and yellow grout on most of the tiles to name a few. As everyone has said the rooms are minuscule and this is from someone who has spent a fair amount of time in Tokyo. My first night had no WiFi but as I was there for work I explained this wasn't good enough.
For my second to fourth nights I was moved to a room which was bigger, certainly a more reasonable size and seemingly cleaner. My first night in the new room the TV didn't work which was annoying. When raised with the front desk staff they were positively rude saying there was a problem with an upgrade of the service the previous day. No apology, I was simply expected to understand it didn't work, without a timeline for a resolution.
Beyond the above: chuck in a rude bar staff member, bars closed for private hire most nights leaving nowhere for residents to drink despite limited other options nearby and an overall scruffy dated look to the rooms left me far from impressed.
The only saving grace was the check out, some confusion about my deposit was handled competently and in a friendly manner (probably the first decent encounter with staff over my stay) a helpful bell boy/man and good door service with luggage and taxi's.

"“The Hudson was a lovely hotel, I'd stay again” We stayed for 9 days it was our first trip to New York, the Hudson was busy and sometimes waiting for the lift or to be seated for breakfast took a little time but I didn't mind, check in was a breeze she gave me a large room that I'd requested as the box rooms in the pics look awful it didn't have a view but in a city like that being in the room wasn't on my to do list, the bed was comfy, a tad harder than my own but ok, nice decor and lovely bathroom, the shower pressure wasn't great but mine at home is very high so I'm always disappointed with other showers, the food at breakfast was yummy, I had a ham and cheese omelete most days, which my other half was massively pleased about, I tried the chocolate pancakes also, again lovely, watching everything being made was a huge highlight, that and one particularly friendly waitress, she smiled and chatted like she enjoyed her job which I appreciated hugely. The location is great, 5mins walk from times sq 2mins from central park...

One problem with the safe, it broke and getting someone to come fix it was a pain and took forever but that's my only negative point and perhaps security was very busy at that precise moment you just never know!

- it is in a good location - minutes away from Columbus Circle and Central Park

- the bathroom is even worse!
- they have decided to stop room service now
- breakfast is daylight robbery!

- if you are staying here, then make sure this is just a place to sleep - make sure you are out most of e time
- I got a load of breakfast items from Whole Foods which is in the basement of the Time Warner Center - for three days stay, I got all I needed from there for less than what you would spend for just 1 breakfast in the hotel

We were on the 5th floor and heard street noise but it was not bad enough to keep us awake, but higher would have been better. Room was very clean and utilitarian in a European way with all of the amenities you would expect, except for free Internet, which was a little annoying.
We enjoyed leisurely walks from the Museum of Natural History (77th) to Times Square. The hotel is almost across the street (Columbus Circle actually) from Central Park.

I was concerned that there would be a lot of noise from the nightclub downstairs,as we were only on the fourth floor and the place was packed, but it was not disturbing in the least. We did not get a chance to enjoy the bar, which looked to be very popular! Next time... It did appear from the floor plan that our room was about twice as big as the standard room. Our larger room was the size of a typical hotel room so just know that if you book a standard it will be half the size of a typical hotel room. If you are coming to sleep it will be adequate; if you want to do more, be sure to get a bigger room. As two friends traveling together for the first time the added space was appreciated!

"“Cool Design..great location...let down by arrogant service” Having just come in from the Delano in Miami. I was keen to try another Morgan's hotel..and I was not disappointed. 
Rolling up to the entrance which has two escalators up to the reception it was certainly a world away from the traditional hotels of New York like The St Regis and The Pierre.
Intial greetings were frosty and there was no one around to carry my bags up and when I eventually checked in my bags took nearly 45 minutes to get to the room.. Was this a indication of what was coming later. 
The penthouse was delightfull with a wonderfull outside terrace and all the designer bits that i expected were there in full affect. The views over lower manhattan was spectacular, and the real fire was a great touch.
The various areas for drinks and dinner were packed with beautiful people of New York, although it was hard to find a space just to find your thoughts and have a chat. waitress service was a non existent in the library bar and we finally went to the Hudson bar and waited ages to get served. Weirdly I was unable to sign for drinks and food to my room and was asked to pay everything straight away which was a hassle. 
Dinner in the Hudson hall was slow and totally over priced. Service is a bit issue, questions went unanswered, food and drinks never arrived and the overall demeanour of the staff was that they could not be bothered. Which was a shame as the food is great and the atmosphere outstanding..
The rest of our stay was marred with non existent service from housekeeping to concierge.

"“24 Hours in NYC: A Royal Trip on a Commoner’s Budget” I did a lot of research before our recent trip to NYC. The Hudson had the best prices by far. And the ambiance was a great bonus. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. The hotel was immaculate and the staff was friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back! See my blog post below...
We departed Philadelphia on a Sunday morning and made our way up to New York on the Megabus ($11 per person). We arrived at the Hudson Hotel ($132 Standard Double) a little early. So, we checked in and checked out all that the hotel had to offer. The dramatic green illuminated escalator carried us to the second floor lobby.

"“Only worth it if booking the loft suite” I am a bit torn of this place because I did have a good and bad experience. The hotel in itself is very nice looking. It is close to the train station, Central Park, and the Time Warner building for shopping. The lobby, bar, and lounge areas are very nice... chic, unique, definitely very inviting. However, one can be easily mislead by the pictures on the website...because the standard room is not at all impressive. Clean without a doubt but very very small. The first time I was here, I booked a standard room, which is by far as small as my hand.... so I disliked my room. I like space in my hotel room and I would not recommend the standard room to stay. Especially for the price for a standard room, you probably could do better in a different hotel. But given the location of the hotel and the nice atmosphere, if you do not mind spending more, than I recommend booking the junior loft suite to stay in. It gives comfort and an ease of movement. The room is nicely decorated. Chiffon curtains that divides the bedroom and the foyer. Mirrors on the wall. Nice living space with TV. The bathroom was white and ever so clean. My boyfriend and I stayed here over night and needless to say, we had a very nice night. The downfall of the place is the slow check in and out. The waitresses in the bar are not attentive as I would like them to be.

"“Save being disappointed and look elsewhere...quick!!!!” I was personally recommended to stay at the Hudson and I can quite easily say it is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I feel the information on the website was misleading and standard perceived hotel service were not available. Such as No room service ( when asked I was advised we stopped it 2 weeks ago???) No Tea or coffee facilities available in the room. Everything at the Hudson is about taking the extra $$$ and not providing a service for guests.
There was also not a safe in the room or a hairdryer as standard. I think the biggest surprise was went I went to work in the Library bar at 3.30pm and asked for a coffee, to be told they do not serve coffee and that I could not get a coffee in the hotel until the Canteen restaurant open at 5.45pm???? What hotel does not provide such client services!!!!!
The Starbucks down the road is doing a roaring trade from fed up and disgruntled people staying at the hotel.
The food options were also most limited and highly over priced and the same every day. I loved the theme but the execution is very poor...$12 for a mini burger???
Too be honest a Hotel that does not provide, Room service, Coffee or Tea facilities in the afternoon, one set menu, can they really be called a hotel or should it be described as a highly expensive bed for hire!!!!!

"“Get rid of those old and harmful mattresses. Video” I spent three nights here recently. The place has the potential to be a great hotel for NY standards due to its privilage location, its interesting design and price range, but they ruin it all when they make you sleep on a very old mattress, the kind of mattress people dump in dark alleys.
We complained the same day we arrived but they didn't give us a solution until next day.
I can put up with the lack of space, but the main reason to pay for a room in any hotel is to have some rest. That will never happen with those old mattresses. 
Not all the rooms in this hotel have mattresses like the one you can see in the video I made (link below) but as long as they keep any, guests may be forced to sleep like fakirs, liying on a bed of harmful and noisy wires.
I sincerely hope this video encourages the managers to get rid of the old mattresses.

"“Traveling solo in New York City” As far as location is concerned, the Hudson Hotel is hard to beat: you are within easy walking distance of subways to anywhere, as well as any number of the dining establishments that grace 9th Ave. and with a little more exertion, MOMA and other cultural possibilities: Lincoln Center and the Frick are both within easy walking distance. But as someone traveling solo, it has been my experience that the staff at the Hudson, while maintaining the highest level of professionalism, are also genuinely themselves. There is no false pretense, only a sense of helpfulness and genuine friendliness that I have come to appreciate and look forward to as part of my overall New York experience. You want me to name names - OK then I will. I know when I ride up the chartruese escalator and see Jackie Vargas at the top, in full greeter mode, that everything will be fine. Ben, behind the concierge desk, will be able to answer any question I may have concerning events and what other things are going on that may not have crossed my radar. Hassan, the bell dispatch, is knowledgeable about far more than just your bags and has a keen attention to detail that extends well beyond his marble counter. And Eric, in the Library Bar, is again, both professional and personable and easily engaged. As someone traveling alone in the Big City, the fact that I know that those people around me ""on staff"" are genuinely concerned with making my time in New York the best it can be goes a long way with me.

"“You can do much, much better in New York” Pros: Groovy environment (an Ian Schrager retrofit of a Holiday Inn, done about 10 years ago, and the Holiday-Inn residue remains, barely disguised by purposefully low illumination--it's barely possible to read anything in the public spaces). Pseudo-hip place to meet up with your pals for a drink, etc. Convenient location.
Cons: Horrible room (a Standard Queen), barely big enough for the bed--you had to kind of lean over the bed in order to walk around it, being careful not to smack your head into the wall-mounted TV. Barely OK for one person maybe, though would feel like a prison cell, but terrible for two. Skip bringing a suitcase, there is nowhere to put it. (Fortunately, we just had a small overnight bag each, which we stuffed in the tiny closet.) The bathroom is tiny, which is OK, but it has a window into the room, and a chiffon curtain, which meant that if you turned the light on in the bathroom, you would wake the other person as the light would shine through onto the bed. No frills whatsover. Light from corridor shone through into room through crack between door and wall from floor to ceiling. Very noisy (woken by drunken guests coming home at 4am, shouting in the corridor, just a few feet from our bed.) Service is hit or miss, mostly miss: Long lines at Check-in, long lines for Concierge (who seemed very inefficient, devoting 20 mins to one customer, telling him all about all the restaurants in the whole of NY it seemed, while many others were waiting in line with quick questions). Forget about calling the Front Desk from your phone in the room--they never answer it. All of this for $335 a night (including taxes). We would never have chosen this hotel--it was booked for us by our host.

"“Think small!” The Hudson Hotel is in a fabulous location, if you can find it! There is nothing on the street that would indicate it is a hotel, but I suppose we looked confused enough and someone outside pointed us to the door. A sign would be helpful. Once inside, it's quite beautiful, although a bit dark. The room, however, was made for Lilliputians! Having once been on a cruise ship, our room at the Hudson was even smaller than that. In order to sit on the toilet, we had to move our knees sideways. Luckily, we are not big people because it would have been very embarrassing to go back to the desk and tell them that we were just too big to be comfortable in the room.

They were overbooked and there were no rooms. There were a lot of angry people and one person working behind the desk. I was eventually given a substandard room at 2 am. I had to work the next day. The front desk person gave me a comp night to compensate for this ridiculous situation. He said he made a note in the system under my reservation number. He told me when I was ready to use the comp night to call the hotel with this reservation number and they would give me the comp night. I called the hotel tonight and it took me an hour of being transferred to 5 different people, disconnected, transferred to voice mailboxes etc... No one seemed to really know what to do or how to handle this. I finally spoke with the assistant manager who told me I was told the wrong procedure. He gave me this ""song and dance"" about how he needs to send a request to the general manager who has to have his assistant type a letter to send to me which should take a week. Really?????? I guess it is an assembly line procedure for this very complex process of providing a customer with a previously agreed upon comp night because the hotel did not have a room for a confirmed reservation.

"“Not a Four Star” This hotel is definitely for the young. Upon arrival into their dark lobby all you can hear is the thump, thump from the bar/club directly opposite. They have mixed very modern with wood and ivy to create a unique decor, one that I do not think works. We were a group of 4 women travelling together and got this hotel by bidding through Expedia so we had no choice. I had called the hotel once I knew and requested two rooms with two beds each but upon arrival they did not have any available so we had to spend the first night in a very small room with a small queen bed where there was hardly room to walk around the bed and the bathroom shower had a window to the room with just a curtain to pull for privacy. We did get upgraded after that and the double rooms are very nice. However the hotel does not even provide coffee makers, half the light bulbs did not work and the use of space in creating these rooms is crazy. It is as if someone cut up a bunch of rooms to make the hotel rooms.

"“We took a chance - and loved it!” We tried hard NOT to stay at the Hudson because the reviews were Marmite-like, ie people love it or hate it. But the others we tried in our hastily-arranged trip weren't available for various reasons so we went to the Hudson for three nights with fingers crossed, and we were very glad we did. As all reviews say, the rooms are very very small, but they are manageable and stylish and have everything we want - in fact we didn't want a TV, which took up a lot of space, even though flat-screen - and how much time do you spend in a hotel room in New York? Any complaint about room size disappeared anyway as soon as we went to the Courtyard Bar, half glass-covered and half open - we stayed there all the first afternoon, wonderful, and visited whenever we could on the other days. The Library Bar is equally enticing, with an open fire that simply looked good on a warm September day, but was very welcome on the cold and wet following day. All staff were exceptionally helpful and the position, at the corner of Central Park and almost next to the Lincoln Centre, couldn't have been better - we didn't use public transport at all during our stay. It's also next to a subway station so we travelled from JFK to the hotel by subway. We only used the restaurant on our last evening, wished we'd gone earlier because it's an event in itself - we'd never seen a restaurant like it, maybe we've led boring sheltered lives! This was meant to be our 'last trip' to the US, but thanks to the Hudson, and the fact that there is a lot left to see, maybe not.....",Lancastrienne,2011-09-01,223023,2011-11-15,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“No issues but no WOW's either” I was hesitant after reading may poor reviews but I received a great rate through Travel Zoo. I had been to the Hudson many years ago but I was there for dinner I was not an over night guest of the hotel. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the hotel back then so when I had the opportunity to stay there I was looking forward to it. I had no issues with staff, I got there about an hour and half prior to check in time and my room was ready. The young lady at the front desk was pleasant and efficient and welcomed us to the hotel. There was no wait to check in we walked right up to the counter. As far as the room it was beyond small, but they do disclaimer that on their website. You can upgrade to a ""larger room"" for a fee, I should have done that. Its almost impossible to fit 2 average size people in the room. The hotel does need some major renovations, you can see the wear in the hallways and the rooms. It didn't bother me because I wasn't expecting a 5 star hotel. Overall the hotel met my expectations, it didn't exceed them. The rate I paid represented value in my mind.

"“Everything was good.” The check in lady was very helpful and profesional. There wasn't a smoking room on available on my room category and she upgraded me to the next level without any extra cost. 
The rooms are small but their dimensions are very well described on Hudson's website. So, I was aware what to expect. 
The Bar was very nice and gets crowded on Friday/Saturday nights but this is a good thing. All the guests can gain access via Concierge services. 
Overall it was a very nice experience and better from what I was expecting. I recommend it and I've already sent all my friends there. 
One thing that they got wrong, was that the concierge desk sent me to the Boom Boom. It was my first time in NYC and I asked the concierge desk to suggest me a place for drinks, they told me go to the Boom Boom room.
I went there and I realized that is a very exclusive bar that I had to be on the guest list. The concierge desk should have know that and either to arrange for me access to guest list of boom boom or not to suggest it at all. That was the only thing that got wrong for me as I was for business there and I had only one night out, which was ruined.

"“Not so nice New York!” I've travelled to NYC many times, for both work and pleasure, and nothing has got nearly as bad as staying at the Hudson Hotel. Considering this is part of the much venerated Morgan's Hotel group, this one is a real bad shocker! It started badly from the moment of arrival - after a long long journey from London, arrived to check in at around 8pm - on the check in desk, only two people were working, and a long line of new guests snaked around the lobby, waiting to be 'processed' - really not good enough for a hotel like this. The real nightmare started when i got my room - the old english proverb of 'not room enough to swing a cat in' must have been created for this place - imagine a dark wood lined cell, with barely enough room to edge around your bed, and an even more space-challenged bathroom - and you're somewhere in the ballpark of what its like to spend a night holed up at The Hudson. The worst incident however was dished up by the Concierge service, where i had the displeasure of dealing with one of the rudest people I've ever encountered - after a long afternoon shopping, i returned to the hotel to find every single bar or dining area in the hotel shut - which doesnt make any sense for a hotel of this size. After enquiring with the concierge i was rudely told there were too many staff sick that day to operate the dining/drinking areas in the afternoon, when i pressed the matter and tried to make him realise the absurdity of what he was saying, he actually raised his hand, and told me ""I'm done talking to you about this subject"", and went to walk away.

"“Worst hotel stay EVER will never stay here again!!!!” Uncomfortably small rooms - no amenities and for $350+ per room this experience was inexcusable and totally unacceptable. Standard room fits only the bed, no room for 2 pieces of luggage so we had to use the very narrow and short hallway for luggage and changing area. No mini fridge or water in room. No bathrobe or slippers. Window from bed into the bathroom - odd - cheap sheer curtains covering window. Bed linens cheap and uncomfortable - down comforter without a duvet, instead covered with a scratchy sheet. A/C unit extremely loud with air blowing onto our faces when in bed. 
Bathroom so small that knees hit wall when sitting on toilet, painted tub with peeling paint, terrible quality towels and space for barely even one person. No q-tips or cotton. 
Hotel hallways are dirty. Room service dirty dishes remain in hallway ALL DAY long. Carpet is tired and hallways are drab. 
After marathon only one bar open because the hotel didnt staff the other bars. Lines were inexcusably long and guests and runners were requesting they open other bars given the high demand. Went up to room and found a note under door saying the hotel was discontinuing room service beginning tomorrow, Monday 11/7 due to lack of demand. This is after this morning learning the hotel would not be offering room service supposedly because of too much demand due to the number of marathon runners staying at the hotel. 
Overpriced miserable experience. Would never stay here again. Oh and when we arrived we waited 20 min to check in - again understaffed. Common theme here all 3 nights 4 days. Do not stay here.

"“Enjoyable Hotel, But Getting a Little Tired” Over the past seven years, I have probably stayed at the Hudson ten times. The hotel has a great location, enjoyable staff and nice facilities. The Llibrary bar is a comfortable location to relax and the outside bar/lounge is one of the nicest ouside hotel spaces in NYC. The hotel is getting a little tired inside with rooms beginning to show their age with some rust stains in the bathrooms, a few cracked tiles here and there, and some skuffs on the furniture. An extra bonus for nightlife is the lobby bar, which turns into a disco late at night. Note that the lobby, hall spaces and elevators are quite dark and there is no hotel sign outside.

"“Are they kidding?” This is basically a one-star hotel going for a four-star price. Whatever interior designer thought they could create actual hotel rooms out of the closet-sized spaces in this building must have been on drugs. Let me explain how small the rooms are. Except for the side facing the door, there was no more than about six inches of space between the bed and the walls in the room I was in. On the side facing the door, there was maybe 18"". A large flat-screen TV was hung on the wall facing the bed. Even though flat, it still projected into the room about eight inches because of the mounting. So it was not physically possible to walk from one side of the bed to the other. I tried it once, kind of leaning inwards and twisting my body to get past the flat-screen TV, but I slipped and fell onto the bed. And as others have noted, you have to sit sideways on the toilet or your knees hit the wall. You'd think that would violate code. Whoever owns this place needs to take a wrecking ball to the entire interior and rebuild it with rooms that fit homo sapiens, not hobbits. On the other hand, if you're shorter than 4' 8"" then you're probably fine staying at the Hudson. The lobby and common areas are certainly very hip and trendy.

I would have preferred a more lively bar given the modern and swanky feel of the hotel, but we weren't really there that often anyway. One disappointment was that the outdoor area was ""closed"" and it wasn't even that cold out. It would have been nicer if there were outdoor heaters and the hotel made an effort to utilize the space.

"“Not for everyone, but fun.” I stayed here with a girlfriend on a girls' weekend trip, after reading all of the positive and negative reviews. First, the public areas of the hotel are well designed, hip, and fun. We received wonderful service, contrary to a lot of the reviews I read. They were very helpful holding our luggage, etc. We had been there before, so we knew that the bars/public areas would be very loud & crowded at night, so that did not bother us. Obviously, I would not stay here with children or if I was looking for a quiet weekend with my husband. 
But yes, the rooms are TINY. Luckily it was a GOOD friend I was traveling with, as there was NO room to spread out in the room (but we were just there to sleep). I am a 5'8"" woman, and when I sat on the toilet, my knees touched the wall in front of me. It was literally like being in a dollhouse. Also, the hallways could use some maintenance, they are a little dark & tattered (it's obviously a very old NYC hotel that's been refurbished, and a lot more attention has gone into the public areas). 
That said, if you are under 35 and looking for a fun place to stay, I'd recommend it.

"“Not for business” I can imagine if you were 25 and just needed a place to crash, the Hudson would be fine. I think there's a reason that everything from the lobby to the rooms is so dark. I get the sense that the place isn't terribly clean. The nasty polyester curtains hanging everywhere in the room only add to that impression. The hallways and doors look like a minimum security facility. I've stayed at hip New York hotels like the City Club, the Bowery and the Hotel on Rivington. Make no mistake, the Hudson is none of those. Being here on business is a disaster. The only lighting in the bathroom is a tiny flourescent bar around the mirror. Can't figure out how to really put on makeup and can't even imagine how a man could shave. There's some ridiculous, tiny excuse for an ironing board. And I'm staying in an ""upgraded"" room.

"“Good but very small, and be careful with discount sites!” We stayed on night at the Hudson while in NYC for business. The location was excellent and ate at a beautiful mexican place down the street that was amazing. Upon check in, the wonderful front desk person told us that our room was a very small room, smaller than the usual small rooms at the Hudson, and upgraded us as we were sharing and were two co-workers and would appreciate a bit more space. We were very thankful and went to our room. By the way, the wait for the elevators our entire stay was awful--at least 5 minute each way. Anyway, the room was the smallest room I have ever seen in my life, and remember, it was an upgrade. There was no way we could have fit in whatever room we were booked in, from a deal on priceline.com. So be careful--even though the price was better ($225 vs. their advertised rates of $350), the room category was obviously awful. The shower and bathroom was literally the size of a normal closet, and there was no desk, no where to sit but on the bed which was very low. Getting dressed the next day for our meeting was a joke. So, just be careful. The good side--the bar with the huge tvs was awesome and full of good people, the outside sitting areas and the lounge are beautiful, and it is cool to stay at the Hudson. Downside--do not even try to bring kids or fit extra people in your room,and do not pack a lot or expect to get work done as there is no where to sit.

I stayed there for three nights without complaining the hotel management on the issue, because it would have been too painful for me to try to pack two times in such a small room.

"“Like a parody of a trendy hotel” The name of the hotel is not on the outside of the building. The staff is young, beautiful, and dressed all in black. The rooms are only about two feet wider than the bed on either side. The lighting is so low that you'll be tempted to use your smartphone's screen as a flashlight. The restaurant is built around the idea that it's a high end school cafeteria. A bottle of beer will set you back $9 and a mixed drink $16. The floor markings in the elevator are confusing enough that two people in our party separately got out at a service floor and couldn't figure out how to get back into the public part of the hotel. There's one chair in your tiny room; it's a desk chair made out of shiny aluminum, which looks fun but hurts after a few minutes.
It has its pluses. The food in the expensive school cafeteria-themed restaurant was good, although so over-salted that you'll run up a bill on sparkling water. Some of the staff was good-natured and fun, although one of the bartenders needs to learn some customer relationship skills. The location is great.

The lobby reminded me strongly of my mental images of Tolkien's Rivendell, and the empty picture frames of the restaurant came to life with projected TV images, all creating a nice atmosphere.
The rooms are admittedly very much on the small side, and there is no closetspace for unpacking, forcing you to live out of your suitcase.

But the location was good. The hotel is not well marked on the outside. The Lobby is amazing...the hotel is really dark by design.

My biggest pet peeve - there were no people at the front desk at check in - if check in is at 3pm, maybe you shouldn't send 3 of 5 staff away on break. They didn't seem to care about the growing lines either.",kiki_caprice,2011-10-01,223023,2011-10-31,False,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Good Stay, Great Location!” I stayed at the Hudson Hotel for a week back in June. I rated the Hudson ""Very Good,"" but I would say my stay was actually ""Good."" It was definitely better than ""Average.""
The Hudson is described as a boutique hotel and if boutique is a synonym for small than boutique it is :). Yes, my room was small and I could almost touch both walls while lying in the middle of my bed (Come to think of it, I actually may have), but saying that, the room was meticulously clean and it offered every amenity that I needed. The bathroom was fantastic, loved the shower! The maids who cleaned my room were wonderful!
Other than the size of the room, my biggest complaint about the Hudson was the lobby. The lobby is nice, pretty, and spacious, but it is so disorganized! Everytime I entered the lobby and I needed to speak with the hotel staff, I never knew which queue to get in. There were queues all over the place and luggage all over the place as well. It just made for a disorganized scene and it doesn't have to be that way. But, once I spoke with the hotel staff regarding whatever question I had, they were very helpful and courteous.
Location, location, location: The location of this hotel is fantastic! It is practically across the street from Central Park. I woke up and went running in Central Park every morning of my stay. The hotel is next to Columbus Circle and the Columbus Circle Subway. There is a shopping center by the Subway entrance with a Whole Foods Grocery in the basement, great place to get food. Plus, there are all kinds of cafes and restaurants within walking distance. 
Other: The exercise room was good offered everything that I needed: Free weights, treadmills, bikes etc.
I found the elevators to be a bit slow, but it could just be due to the volume of people in the hotel. The hotel always seemed to be crowded. While in the elevator, I dug the music that was played and piped in throughout the hotel. I also like the fact the music that is played in the hotel is available online, nice touch. 
I liked the vibe of the hotel. There was a fun energy and it always seemed like there was something going on.
Very easy hotel to access a taxi, plus the doormen were very helpful.
All in all, a good stay at the Hudson.",padcrasher,2011-06-01,223023,2011-10-31,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Fun, funky decor, but smaller than shoebox sized hotel rooms” This cool hotel has a funky ,night club vibe, and is a HUGE party hotel, but it has a great Columbus circle address, and surprisingly casual, quiet and cool rooftop terrace! Very relaxing, but they kick you out at 11PM...and the hotel clubs rock til 4 AM. Rooms are quiet, but are the size of closets. NOTfor large men, tall people, or for anyone AT ALL claustrophobic. The bathroom is 2 feet by 4 feet. Warning, shower is visible by glass wall to beds!! Glad I was alone!! (Tiny half tub, toilet, sink, no place for the wash bag, and light so poor that I cannot put in contact lenses. I am 5'5"", 130 lbs, and I could not close the door to use the toilet, or dry my hair without both my elbows hitting walls. 
 Very clean, quite safe, hotel and the housekeeping, security, and repair staff are AMAZING! And the FAB Bell men are totally hot models. I know, cuz I met them. ALL!! No luggage, soap ,or hairdryer. I had a broken tub plug, broken A/C in 96 degree weather ,and best of all?? Locked out of my rooms by key card failure 3 times in 38 hours, and for 3hrs prior to check out, (lovely houseepers couldn't help, they called a great security man, he was embarrassed,the poor man was freaking out, cuz the key card unlock machine they use for the cops... wouldn't let me back in.....) and then I was charged for a late check out!! And someone else's 248$ charges landed on my Visa the following month. Room prices are OK, check in/out is a torment, and the elevators are impossibly slow, up to 15-18 minutes wait, one way. We walked down from the 16th floor....twice, both days.
This hotel was a dissapointment, and my only criteria for a hotel room are: clean, safe, and my own bathroom, at a fair price.

"“Small, noisy room in poor repair - location is only draw” This hotel has an excellent location and a very nicely decorated, roomy lobby. The staff were very friendly and responsive to requests. The room was very clean. That is really the only good things I have to say about the hotel.
They have the smallest rooms I have ever seen. The room is only slightly larger than the bed it contains. I have had hotel rooms whose bathrooms were larger than the entire Hudson's hotel room. The room size was fine for my purposes (I just needed a place to sleep when not out and about on my business trip) but could be a concern for the typical traveller who might want to spend more time in the room. If I had travelling with my wife, a sense of claustrophobia might have ensued. The staff obviously gets a lot of static about room sizes, since the woman at the reception desk began pre-emptively explaining it as a ""feature"" of being a ""boutique"" hotel. I let that go, but I've stayed at many boutique hotels and overly miniature living space is not a requirement.
My main issue was the extremely poor soundproofing. From the 4th floor the street noise sounded as though the windows were wide open. The hotel is obviously aware of the issue as it leaves complimentary ear plugs in the room. However, the noise level was bad enough that these were insufficient and I managed little sleep. I would strongly recommend that any guest insist on a room on a much higher floor.
Other issues were the shabbiness of the room. The built-in furniture had numerous dings and scratches that had not been re-painted or even sealed. The door had two holes that were patched but not repainted. This was in stark contrast to the public areas of the hotel.
My company paid about $400 a night which seemed excessive for what I received.",Northquarter,2011-10-01,223023,2011-10-30,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Very disappointing” I had a very disappointing stay at the hudson, which just turned into a comedy of errors. Cochroachs, broek hairdryer and safe, only a small porthole window (in some rooms) - i finally upgraded and moved rooms, only to find another broken hairdryer and safe. 4 of the 6 lifts were down but the room service guy still felt it was acceptable to turn one off so he didn't have to wiat on his way back (and informed the wiating guests who complained that it was off now and we should just wait). A colleague alos stayed there and she had to sit on the floor next to her door to get wi-fi. overall a pretty poor stay and given the price there are far better options in NY. If you want funky and trendy try the ACE or if you want to be near the Hudson try the Empire.

"“QUICK decline of a hotel” I've stayed at the Hudson in the past, and therefore when the opportunity to return to NYC surfaced, I did not hesitate recommending this hotel for my colleagues' and my 6 night stay. It looks like that in 2 years, things have started to decline, and the overall experience was pretty poor.
Before even returning, I had read the many poor reviews, and thought that people were exagerating - but it looks like people's issues have come to full fruition.
Issues:
1. Television did not work the 1st evening. Had to go to front desk to have it serviced. 
2. It took more than 60 minutes for my luggage to be delivered to my room upon arrival. 
3. There was no hot water during the 1st day and therefore had to take a luke warm shower at 7:00 am. As you can imagine, not the most pleasant experience. Again informed front desk, and was resolved
4. The phones were erratic. The message indicator light was going on and off for no reason. 
5. LAST morning, I took a bitterly cold shower at 4:30 in the morning!!! Not a sign of heat!!!!
6. Upon comparing notes, it sounds like my colleague's rooms did not have hot water as well!
7. Safe was missing in my colleague's room!?!
To be frank with you, for the price point of this hotel, the amount was unjustifiable. Basic services such as hot water should not be optional. I actually accepted the small size of the room, but when it comes to basic ammenities, that's when I'm a bit perplexed.
I am returning to NYC in December, and at this point I have no incentive to return to your hotel. I would live to hear the reasons behind my inconveniences. To be frank with you, I have read the poor reviews of the Hudson on tripadvisor. But unfortunately, if looks like your hotel is beginning to live up to its poor reputation. 
Sabrina from Customer Service contacted me, and informed me that there are a myriad of upgrades beginning in January. I have plans to return to NYC in December, and am very skeptical of the idea of returning to this hotel. For the price that you're paying, it might be better to really consider spending a bit more and bringing your business else where.

"“Good location” I stayed at this hotel in October for a business trip. Upon arriving, it was a little confusing where the lobby was (I also arrived late in the night). Going up the escalators, I was greeted by very loud club music, not realizing that the hotel has a bar that opens until late. The clerk was very nice and offered to move my room to another floor, away from the noise. I was grateful since I really needed a good night's sleep! The room was spacious and accomodating ( I stayed in a Junior Suite) although the bed was a little low on the ground. Room and bathroom was clean as well.
The only complaint I have about this hotel is that there needs to be more elevators to accomodate all 22 (or 23) floors. It looked like there are 7 but only a few were working the next day. Hence, every floor was backed up and it seemed like an eternity for the elevators to get to the 18th floor! Give yourself an average of 10 to 15 minutes to get an elevator and then stopping on every floor, until your actual floor. 
Breakfast was a la cart or you can order, very expensive, so your best bet will be to go to the Starbucks right down the street (across from the Time Warner Building). Hotel is within vicinity of good shopping at Time Warner's as well as walking distance from the shopping on Madison Avenue.
Overall, a pleasant stay except for the elevators!",fsu2001,2011-10-01,223023,2011-10-29,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great location, good base to explore” Upon arriving at the Hudson, which has several potted trees outside the unidentified door, we were taken by escalator up to the reception which is darkly lit. The reception 'desk' itself appeared to be dark wood and was as long as the reception area. Providing some of the lighting is a large chandelier which casts light onto what appears to be ivy creeping up the walls and onto the celing. It gave a sense of calmness and a haven from the heat/busy/neon lights Times Square has to offer! There is a garden bar directly behind the reception (which we didn't use) a 'Library' bar which provided a beer and a cocktail for $24 and the famous 'under floor lit' bar. We were on the 14th floor in a Queen Room. There was outside noise which could be heard-but we were usually exhausted form the day so this didn't bother us. The room was small, as others have mentioned. I'm 5'6 and didn't struggle but my partner is 5'11 and had to shuffle about a bit! The bed was very comfortable and the room came with air conditioning as standard which was very handy. The room also came witha safe which was practical and easy to use (with instructions). The bathroom, well, again it was on the small side. I didn't struggle but my partner did. The shower was powerful and the bath could be filled twice in quick sucession and there was no problem with the hot water! There was also a hairdryer supplied (handy for ladies to know before you go away!) and also an iron and ironing board. We found there was plenty of storage space for our taken items and subsequent purchases. The cleanliness of the room was of standard and I have to say we didn't experience a problem re the cleaners. We were usually out of the room for 0800 on a couple of occasions we stayed on later but put the 'privacy please' sign on the door and weren't bothered-although our room had always been cleaned by the time we arrived back! On each floor level there are drinks/snacks machines. I've also gotta say, although the door wasn't signed we didn't have a problem finding the hotel. The only dealings we had with staff were brief but we found them to be professional and polite. The hotel is a short walk away from Broadway/Times Square/Subway lines which was great!
Likes: the reception, atmosphere, distance to attraction/subway
Dislikes: occasionally one of the lifts wouldn't be working and would take what appeared to be 24+ hours to fix so the one that was would be choc full-the stairway from the 14th floor was occasionally walked as refused to wait!",Jena B,2011-10-01,223023,2011-10-27,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Fun place, but don't pay full price!” I really like The Hudson, but I don't think I'd pay the full price of $400 or so a night. Lobby very cool, I found the staff (esp concierge) to be very helpful. The room was pretty small but meticulously clean, and I love the high thread count sheets and designer toiletries! I was on the 11th floor so no noise complaints.
Only complaints: the air conditioning appeared to have three settings: cold, hot and off. The room did not have a safe and while front desk assured me one would be sent up, I was connected to security who apparently did not have ""any spare"", which was a touch annoying. There was also a glass wall between the shower and the bed, so might be a little weird if you were travelling with a friend rather than a lover!

"“Room with a view; almost!” Location of the Hudson is great. The grounds are fantastic. Rooms are no larger than a postage stamp. In my entire life of travel I've never stayed in a room so small; however ingeniously designed to appear larger at first glance.
The small bathroom was not very clean. For such a tiny space one would think the chamber maids could manage to do a better job. They do a great job at banging around the hall and door areas early morning.
The garden bar area is beautiful but the service is below standard. Brilliant restaurant concept but wouldn't burn a meal there. NYC has far better choices.
For the most part the staff are helpful. They don't seem to care or like their jobs. More like a transit stop to a bigger and better place.",Cynthia-LAX,2011-09-01,223023,2011-10-27,False,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great lobby & staff, dinky rooms” As has been said, the rooms are quite small. Our room had a queen size, low bed, the smallest bathroom imagineable and the entrance and hallway looked like it was sized for a submarine. Then again, this is New York, the bed was comfy and the water was strong and hot. We got a relatively inexpensive room through travelzoo.
The entrance to the hotel is a bit strange as there are no signs; just a bunch of cool looking guys dressed in black outside. The lobby is dark but quite attractive. Apparently, the building was once a domitory; they serve drinks in a room called the ""Library"". Nice, big leather chairs, pool table, shelves of books and a big fireplace. We had drinks there before our show and it was quite nice. They also have a wonderful outside area behind the reception desk that was quite a surprise and very pretty. 
The staff were very helpful and friendly. We had a great time here. The hotel is right near Columbus Square and all the subway lines which was very convenient.

"“Still an interesting place to stay.” I've been staying at the Hudson since early 2000 when it was a freshly renovated hotel.

An Ian Schrager hotel designed by Philipe Stark it's very visually interesting. The Library is quite cozy for a drink. Once upon a time the lobby bar was THE place to hang. It's proximity to Columbus Circle, the Subway and Central Park make it a desirable place to stay. Do I recommend it? For a price....yes. What is that price?

"“Small, Smarmy Rooms and Poor Service--Never Again” I was coming into NYC on business, and my company has a corporate rate (20% off lowest available rate) at the Morgan Hotel Group. The manager in our NY office suggested the Hudson, so I called to make a reservation. First, I was quoted a rate that was significantly ABOVE their ""lowest rate"" on their website. Huh? What happened to this great rate? I worked with the reservation agent (who, to the company's credit, was very personable and professional) and finally found an acceptable rate for a standard room. The agent also asked if I had any requests. I specifically asked for a QUIET room. He was happy to oblige.
So, I get to the hotel and there's no sign outside. I had to ask my driver several times if this was, indeed, a hotel. He chucked and said yes. I got out and was greeted by a guy in an overcoat. No uniform. I was thinking that this guy was maybe a bellman, maybe stealing my luggage. Whew. Bellman/Doorman. Okay.
So up the chartreuse escalator I go. I looked at my sickly green tinted hands (bad lighting) and had a bad feeling. I arrived at the impressive lobby--huge desk, indoor foliage...it looked like a park in the lobby. However, it was as dark as a park in the middle of the night. Small spotlights lit up the front desk personnel like eerie ghost-receptionists. I walked up to the desk and was greeted warmly. I then went through the check-in process and was duly informed that they would be charging $200 on my card as ""security"" for incidentals. Um, what? I was ""assured"" that if I didn't go beyond my ""expected"" bill, that the charge would be refunded. Um, what? You're charging my card for an amount I haven't spent and may not spend? Okay...
Anyway, I got my room key and went up to my room. I walked in to a very funky, tiny, wood-paneled room. I have stayed in NY hotels before, but this was small for even those standards. But okay, it was clean. Kind of tired and old, but clean. The desk? Totally Ikea, as was the rest of the decor. However, the issue was the noise. I was in a corner room on the 6th floor on a busy street. And the windows wouldn't close. This was about as far from quiet as one could get. I might as well have been sleeping on a balcony. I go down to the front desk, and they said that they would have to send engineering with a special ""key"" to close the windows. WhatHUH? Yes, people cannot shut a window by themselves at this hotel. You need an engineer.
So the engineer gets there. There is NO key. He has a hammer and a screwdriver and POUNDS the window shut. It was broken. But even shut, the noise is...well, pretty darn bad. So I call down to the front desk and state that I was specifically asked if I had a special request and stated that I wanted a quiet room. ""That's not guaranteed."" Okay, so did you check if there was a room on the inside of the hotel? No. So they check, and voila, there is! Would they send up the key? NO. We're too busy. Sorry, you have to come down and get it.
So I do. And when I get down there, the front desk has NO idea what I'm talking about and I have to explain all over again. And I'm again admonished for NOT knowing that a request is not something that they really can fulfill. And even though they had a quiet room, it wasn't really something that they could fulfill??? Okay.
So up to the 2nd room I go. I walk in. It's smaller than the first one, if that's possible. Yes, it is. But it's so small that there is NOWHERE to put my clothes. No bureau. NO CLOSET. NO HANGERS. NO IRON or BOARD. 
Now I'm angry. I call down and speak to a manager and give him HELL. WTF? No closet? In a hotel? What...do they rent this room by the hour??
I relay my disgust, dismay and total fatigue. I had been traveling all day, hadn't eaten and was about at the end of my rope. So he ""upgrades"" me to a larger room AND sends up a key. And who delivers it? The gal that was ""too busy"" before. HA.
So I get to the next (and final) room. It's quite (on the garden side of the hotel). It has two double beds and a small sitting area. Apparently, this is a gargantuan suite in their minds. To me, it's about the size of a NORMAL hotel room anywhere, and smaller than most in NYC. But it's quite, it has a closet and a TV and a safe. Finally.
So, I'm sure that others have had better experiences. I did not. I won't be back, Sabrina (Guest Relations Manager), so don't ask me to ""give you another chance."" I won't.

"“Lovely reception, but that's it!” The reception area of the Hudson certainly has the 'wow' factor and the bar area is very chic, but that's where it ends. Our room was TINY! Luckily we are both relatively slim people, but even then we had trouble squeezing into the bathroom. On our second night, we returned to our room to find it smelt like off fish. We couldn't trace the source of the smell and so called the front desk which promised to send a housekeeper - who never arrived.
We had a room facing the courtyard on the 7th floor. It was noisy. We slept with earplugs on both nights.
The other issue with the hotel which was incredibly frustrating and all guests were complaining about was that only one elevator (out of seven) was working. The wait for the lift was terribly slow and often when it arrived it would be already full and we'd have to wait for it to come back up - we'd jump in it on its way up to ensure we had a spot in it on the way down!

"“Overall experience did not live up to the majesty of reception area” We have always wanted to stay here, ever since we came for a drink in the library bar a few years back, and so our expectations were fairly high. Unfortunately, our experience did not live up to the majesty of the reception/lobby area.
The fact that the rooms are tiny did not matter to us, despite the fact that one of us is 6ft4. We aimed to spend very little time here anyway to explore the city and just viewed it as a place to get some sleep.
Here are the problems we encountered:
No in room safe. When we reported this, we were told that security were on their way up. An hour later we were still waiting, getting more wound up as we really wanted to get on with our day, and get out of the room (which as i mentioned above, we had planned to spend as little time in as possible). Someone eventually arrived and said it would be fixed by 3. We came back at 6 and it was still in the room, untouched. So we were moved to a different room, and guess what? That one didn't work either! We eventually got it resolved, but by then we felt let down by the hotel.
The lifts! Only 3 of the lifts work and if you are checking in and out of the hotel at busy times with luggage, allow yourself about 20 minutes just to get in a lift! I witnessed many people giving up waiting to walk down 8 flights of stairs.
No Wifi! Frankly very disappointing. I managed to log on in the lobby and paid $30 for the privilege, but couldn't get in either of the rooms we stayed in.
I would not recommend this hotel to a friend for these reasons, as well as the bar being too expensive and it being a quite noisy from the traffic outside. It's a real shame and put a bit of a downer on our trip.",Lurleen_Lumpkin,2011-10-01,223023,2011-10-19,False,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“The good and the bad MOSTLY BAD!” We saw the some poor reviews but it we decided to give this hotel a shot because of the Morgan name. WHAT A MISTAKE! I honestly would stay away from this hotel for a few strong reason. 
1. Confirmed price from website booking was not the price we ended up being charged. Reception refused to do anything and basically told us to eat the cost. It was more about the principle then the extra cost. 
2. No such thing as non smoking since they don't care if of other customers are smoking on a non smoking floor! Reception said they would look into it but through out the week we stayed there we can smell the smoke. 
3. After arriving we had to wait 4 hours before we were able to check in to our room. We arrived at the hotel at 1pm. After waiting the 4 hours they gave our rooms away and gave us different rooms on the same floor, why we had to wait 4 hours is beyond me especially if our room was given to someone else. 
4. Managers asked if we were happy and when we told them about our problem we were offered late check out by 4pm. Great our flight was for 11am so I'm not sure how that helps...
So on to the good:
1. cleaning service and room service staff were wonderful!
2. Great location
We booked 2 rooms with 4 adults, we've all been to NYC before and stayed at various other hotels without the horrible service received at this hotel by front desk and managers. We gave a negative feed back on the survey they sent to us but no response from management at all. So trust us when we say this hotel doesn't care about your or it's service level!

"“Mixed review” The Hudson is showing some wear and tear. The standard rooms are seriously tiny and too small for 2 people with luggage. The double doubles are fine. The hotel lobby is attractive but dark, in fact the whole hotel is rather dark. The bars are attractive, especially the outside bar, but expensive for a casual drink. The location was good for me and the staff was pretty helpful despite a slight mix up. One complaint - the elevators, it sounds minor, but they are so crowded and take forever. At near $500 a night for the double double I would suggest looking at some other options.",MimpiTX,2011-10-01,223023,2011-10-16,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Amazing Public Spaces” While the rooms were small-- I found that problem in many other hotels in NYC. What sets this hotel apart is the quirky and many public spaces.

Plus the location is extraordinary. Near public transportation as well as close to many restaurants of all prices.",ladybegood,2011-08-01,223023,2011-10-13,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Broken down has-been” Really disappointed - everything in this hotel is sub-standard. 
- The lifts are broken down (2 of 6 work, with the result that it takes forever to get to any of the Hudson's 24 floors),
- The beds are cheap skeletons (you can feel the springs through the sheets), 
- The rooms are tiny (so small in fact, that if you're over six foot you can't actually sit on the child-size toilet), and
- The staff are chaotic. 
The Sky Terrace, which should be one of the redeeming features of the place is closed ""out of season"" (Fall). The hotel is still trading off a reputation of being a bit cool - it might have been once, but the brick veneer and plastic vines in the lobby are looking pretty dated these days; the giant watering can in the 'park' is worth an embarrassed titter at most - Phillip Starck meets Martha Stewart.
As a fan of the Morgan chain's Mondrian in LA, I had high expectations of the service, comfort and design at this chain member in New York.

"“Outside hui, inside so lala” Just spend 4 night at the Hudson. The location is good, 5 minutes walk to Central Park and ca 20 Minutes walk towards midtown with Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Theatreland etc. The bars are beautiful furnished as it is the hotel. But unfortunately some of the staff thinks they are too cool/beautiful to serve. We waited quite long to be served and we saw even people approach the bar to get their own driks while the waitress was to busy to talk to the other waiters. The rooms are dingy and very small. We booked a standard room which is a queen bed (140 wide). There is no room whatsoever for the 2nd person although it says it is for 2 people. We switched to a twin bed room which is double the size and costs 100US dollar more per night. The bathrooms were somehow refurbished and cleverly decorated but it the end it was a old bath plus new and modern shelves. The beds are very comfortable. Although we were in the 19th floor we heard everything - means you need some oropax to get some decent sleep.

"“And now for something completely different” Was it John Cleese or Sophocles who said “to quote the bleeding obvious” New York – the city that never sleeps - is completely different from any other city. The Hudson Hotel, likewise. Having read the draconian warnings about the size of the rooms on this site, I was nervous, being built the size of your average polar bear, that I might not actually fit into a room. Worry not, yes, some of the Hudson rooms are not the size corporate America might like but they are plenty big enough to rest a weary head. Yes, you may have to practice your limbo dancing to use the loo, but this is not such a hardship. Anyone who spends time in their room in New York must be doing something wrong. There are many plusses – the design is quirky, interesting and at all times captivating – some may find it dark, I did not. The staff are, without exception, well-motivated and friendly – from Larry on check-in, to Duty Manager Megan and the staff who clean the rooms. I asked for a high up, quiet room and was offered one. I enjoyed the public areas – most of which I knew from attending functions over the years. Any negatives? Well, I was surprised that there were no tea and coffee-making facilities in the room but then there are shops for coffee and breakfast all along the block. And I was pretty horrified to be charged for bottles of water that appeared uninvited in my room on a couple of occasions (in spite of having a very obvious 5 litre bottle in situ). Would I recommend this hotel, most definitely; would I come again.

I mentioned it to the person at the desk the next morning and she said that the bars/clubs were only open from Wednesday until Saturday (or Sunday, don't quite remember). The logic was poor, as I couldn't justify making this only my Monday and Tuesday night option when I stay in the City.

"“The Hotel with a Hidden Gem” Arrival:
I stayed at this hotel with my friend on the 27th September to the 1st October and I was very wary due to some of the reviews below. This hotel is in an ideal location, a 5 - 10 minute walk to Times Square, with many bars, diners, shops and restaurants surrounding it. Upon arrival (around 4.30pm) we were served straight away by a friendly receptionist, who gave us our room card and my request of being on the highest floor possible (23rd) had been granted. I was asked to give my card to keep on record in case of damage to the room etc. I was not aware of this and did not have the money on my card, however, I asked if I could leave a cash deposit and this was fine. 
The Room:
Off we went to our hotel room, in preparation for it to be so tiny we couldn't move, I must of had one of the larger standard rooms and it was a comfortable fit for 2. however it is a small room, but your only there to sleep and get ready right? The beds were clean, the rooms smelt fresh and well aired and the bathroom was fully stocked with towels, toilet paper, soap, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and a small hairdryer on the back of the door (which came in useful when my hairdryer was too powerful for the voltage)The bathroom is VERY small though and I am not sure you can call the bath a bath, I don't think the Hudson do though. 
We used all the towels daily which were replaced everyday, along with any of the complimentary toiletries. 
The room is quirky but simple. One thing that did annoy me with the room is the humming from the air conditioning unit behind the bed, however, I did not notice this at all when I came back after a day of sightseeing and neither did my friend. 
The roof terrace: 
It took us three days to get here as we had been so busy experiencing NYC, however when we got to the terrace it took our breathe away. I highly recommend taking a visit here at night. The skyline of NYC is lit up. Try a cucumber cooler ($16 - But tasty), a Grolsch will set you back about $12 but this can slightly be justified because it is a large bottle. OK so the prices are Expensive, but grab your drinks look at the skyline and it is worth it. 
The Lobby and Garden Bar:
1st night, this was empty, glowing lights but no customers or staff. We did go back a second time however the barman was more interested in lighting candles then serving, so we went outside to the garden bar. Raining but comfortable as half is protected by shelter. Same prices apply here but the cucumber cooler was not as good :-(
13th Floor....?
There is no 13th Floor? I am still confused by this. 
Internet cafe/business center:
Fancy paying $7.95 by card only, for 15 min use on the net...I didn't either. However this allows me to mention one perfect helper at the Hudson. After walking out of the business centre, we decided to ask where a certain restaurant was at reception. We were welcomed by the most helpful guy ever called LARRY! He was able to hunt down the hotel for us, also helped us when it came to late check out. He was friendly, helpful and a true credit to the Hudson Hotel. 5*s just for him,thank you so much larry..... and also a thank you to MATTHEW at the concierge desk who called our transfer shuttle to locate them as they were late.

"“Great Location but get a room above 16th Floor!” This is the second time I have stayed at the Hudson and i must admit their Customer Service has improved hugely from my last stay, all the staff were helpful and very friendly, the door staff are an asset to the Hotel, they manage to conjure up cabs even in the middle of thunder storm!
Bedrooms are small but this is New York but ensure you get a room above the 16th Floor unless you intend to party all night and want the sound of the bar & music in your room!
The roof garden on the 15th floor is a beautiful space to go and chill with your ipad or a book

"“Love the hotel but had a bad experience” I'm sitting in the hotel room right now at 3am writing this review because I'm shocked at the front desk and management team for the night. We've been renting 2 rooms for the last 3 nights and just decided to extend our stay for 2 more nights. We went to the receptionist and asked how much to extend our stay. She gave us the rack rate, at $250/night and suggested we call Reservations or look online for a better deal. (We originally booked the rooms on hotels.com for $170/night only 1 day before checking-in) so we went upstairs to the room and began searching. Reservations quoted us $450/night, and we couldn't find any cheaper online so we returned back downstairs to book the $250/night. It's a Monday, so we were hoping for a better rate but oh well. 
The Front Desk agent tells us ""Sorry, the price has gone up to $450/night. There's nothing we can do about it"" Of course we requested to speak to a Manager since less than an hour ago she had suggested we call Reservations , only to lose out on the original price. Why hadn't SHE offered to call Reservations for us in the first place?! The agent called a Manager, and a quick ""no"" was the final answer. Why did no manager show-face? It's 2 am, he's on shift, I imagine not too busy...maybe eating a donut in the back?? It's in his job description to address concerns of all guests. 
Here's the kicker: When we asked if there was anything they could offer, the agent responded ""Well it's not like you come here often."" !!! Are you kidding me? It's our second time at this hotel, and we've just been told that we are not ""regulars"" enough for being considered a discount, which translates to we don't deserve good customer service. Did she forget how a clientele is created?? First impressions and keeping the customers happy. That's a no-brainer. Wow. Not to appear snobby, but I've worked in 5 star hotels at the Front Desk and that is definitely not how the management or the representative would handle this situation. A discount/different rate IS possible, and at the minimum a complimentary meal, or anything, for the inconvenience. 
Needless to say we've booked somewhere else.

"“Stay Away From This Hotel- You Have Been Warned” The Hudson Hotel is located very close to Columbus Circle. There are many restaurants in the area and if you go down 9th Ave you can find many different cuisines. If you want a quick bite right outside is a sushi place, Pinkberry, and Subway. 
You should also know the Hudson Hotel is known for its nightlife. If you are older then 35 and cannot handle a loud and obnoxious crowd in the evenings then DO NOT stay here. 
There many other hotels at the same price point that are far better then this old dump. Just look on this website and you can go wrong with the top 50 hotels listed on TripAdvisor. 
**If you can afford to stay at the Mandarin Oriental which one block away, do it if you want and you will have a much better experience. 
The Check-in took some time as there was only two individuals working the front desk. I had no complaints as the young lady was very friendly. As most have mentioned in other reviews the hotel does not brightly lit. 
The hallways look like they were painted by an amateur painting company as it looks very dodgy. The rooms were clean but small as most have mentioned previously. 
The bathroom was small and I am a tall man so it was cramped. 
The breakfast is mediocre at best, I can see why the place was rather empty. The breakfast is buffet style. After being seated the waiter was nowhere to be found as I wanted Orange Juice. I highly recommend going the to the Le Parker Meridian for brunch on Saturday or Sunday. It is excellent. Sarabeth's which is a short cab ride away is also solid, though there may be a wait if you don't have a reservation.

"“TINY, Tiny Rooms, Dark confusing Hallways” I booked here last minute, because most other decent hotels in NYC was either sold out or $700 + that night. I made a reservation direct for a non-smoking room, and upon arrival, they had mentioned the hotel was sold out and could only had one room to give me. OK, I understood the rooms were tiny from the get go, but the room they gave me was a smoking room on the 6th floor facing a brick wall. The room stunk of cheap perfume masking heavy smoke, and I am skinny and tall, when I went to tinkle standing, it was not really possible. If the room was not smelly, and facing a brick wall, maybe it would be OK, but the hallways are dark, dingy concrete hallways like a maze, and look like what I imagine a dungeon being.

"“an interesting place to stay” Very different -- no marquee or sign at all --- thought it was a club---the people walking around appeared very trendy and well dressed. Going in the front door you take an escalator up to the front desk. It is very dimly lit, again like a dance club. The ambience is interesting --- there are all kinds of areas to hide or get lost if you want to be alone with yourself or someone else. The location is great, near the subway, Central Park and restaurants and bars. My room was quite small, but was clean and comforrtable. Room service was great, they even ironed a shirt for me on short notice. The front desk staff is polite and competent unless you have a problem ( I did, my reservation and rate had been botched by Hotwire). To my surprise the two female clerks and one male manager hid behind the corporate curtain instead of giving true customer service (i.e. the computers are not set up for this and we've never done this type of thing before). For me customer service starts when the customer has a problem ( reasonable, not outrageous) and is taken care of in a expedient and reasonable manner. The personnel previously mentioned failed miserably and willfully, a solution was availiable, but they refused to take the time to deal with it. Finally, the second day I spoke to a female manager and she took care of my concern right away without any hesitation-- and she is to be commended. So if I am a ""guest"" with a reasonable problem, (which mine was) I feel I should be given a reasonable solution by any of the staff, after all thats what customer service is, and this is a 4 star hotel. Coupled with this issue, I found the bartender in the patio to be somewhat rude, In contrast, the ""cow library"" bartender was very nice and the concierges were very helpful and engaging.

Furthermore, in case you are overweight, believe, you won't be able to enter in the bathroom, which is unacceptably tiny.

Some irritations: - having an 18% gratuity service charge added in the restaurant...it's self-service!; charging $8 for 15 minutes on the computer; extortionate telephone charge - over $30 for 5 minutes to New Jersey...and be prepared to wait for busy lifts, particularly in the morning.

"“An ideal place for a couple of nights.” We stayed here for three nights whilst on a short break to New York. The rooms are very small but very clean and well appointed. Ideal location, just a short stroll from Central Park and Broadway. The hotel offers excellent friendly service and is very trendy with a good bar and restaurant, and the roof terrace is superb. We used the hotel purely as somewhere to lay our heads as we were out sightseeing from dawn to dusk.

We stayed there again in July, 2011 for 5 nights. On the first night I was surfing the internet in my room when suddenly the screen flickered and went blank. I was not able to revive it. 
I took it to Best Buy the next morning and was told that it had been a victim of a power surge and that the cost of fixing it was more than it was worth. I mentioned this to the concierge at the Hudson and he encouraged me to report this to security. Then they upgraded our room (to a very spacious one!) and comped us a meal in the restaurant. After I returned home, I received a check in the mail for the full value of my laptop. How amazing is that? That is what I call customer care, for sure.

"“modern and discreet, tiny rooms but overall very nice” Stayed here with work for 3 nights. Had read views from others and apprehensive of the tiny rooms- yes the room and bathrooms are tiny, but if you are on your own then you'll be fine. I can image that for two people with a little more luggage it could be a bit of squeeze (ie only person can be in the bathroom at any time).
the dark and moody lighting in the lobby is cool. my Mum would hate it as she'd say she couldn't see anything.
the entrance to the hotel is very discreet which I really appreciate.
check in and out all seamless. concierge very helpful. security at the door very helpful.
it's a shame there isn't a snack/ drinks bar in your room (there are vending machines on each floor), apparently the hotel are looking into this for the future.
there was a private party on two consequtive nights we were there which meant we didn't experience the use of the bar areas adn by the time we came back the sky terrace was closed (11pm)
 it's a shame that you have to wait for the lifts for quite a long time (esp at peak times!)

"“Like a nightclub!” We stayed at this hotel as part of a competition prize so we didn't choose the hotel or pay for the room. 
The hotel is very dark! Lots of dark wood panelling, low lighting and loudish music create a nightclub feel which is ok but probably not for everyone. The roof terrace on the 15th floor was beautiful but very disappointed that it closed at 10.30pm on a Friday night. The rest of the hotel was heaving with people so I don't understand why they closed this facility so early.
The room we had was tiny although this wasn't a problem for us as we spent all our available time sightseeing so only slept here. Bed was comfy and we got a good nights sleep. There was an iron, ironing board, hairdryer, safe and toiletries included in the room but no tea/coffee facilities.
Breakfast was included for us but I would definitely find a local cafe if it isn't included in your booking as I thought it was very expensive. The hotel staff were very friendly and in the main efficient.
The location is good, a short distance from Central Park and not far from the start of the shops and sights.

"“Wont be staying again!” This was my first visit to NYC for the last week in August. Rooms Very small, the only thing seperating the room from the also very small bathroom was a piece of glass and a see-thru curtian. Now i have travelled all over the world and seen many different types of hotels but this is the first time i have been using a hair dryer, the same time as my boyfriend using the iron and this has blown all the electrics in our room! Very dark dingy rooms and even darker public spaces. The staff overall seemed quite helpful apart from the women who ran the table service outside and the manager on reception. The women who ran table service at the bar only seemed interested if you were a group of guys or a middle aged businessman.Man times we had to go to the bar ourselves to get our $9 bottle of beer. The hurricane was supposed to hit on our last morning in NYC so our flights were cancelled. British Airways holidays were amazing in helping us rebook our flights and said they would call our hotel on our behalf to extend our stay, OR NOT as the case was (no fault of BA). The girls on reception we spoke to were lovely trying to arrange for us to stay the 3 extra nights we needed. however, the reception or hotel manager could have not have been more rude, any cancellations they were due to get would be for his staff and no waiting lists to extend stays. This may have been the case however there are ways of saying this to customers, and this was not the right way. The reception staff went out of their way to help us find another hotel in NYC, and i thanked them for this, they seemed slightly ashamed of there 'manager' and the way we were spoken to (millenium UN plaza was AMAZING!)

"“Worst hotel experience I have encountered. DO NOT STAY HERE!” I pre-booked the hotel in June with the intention of staying 2 nights at the end of August. We needed to come and stay at the hotel a day earlier due to the hurricane preventing us from going to Washington. Booked for the extra night and was told that we would just have to pay for the extra night as should be logical. However the hotel decided that it would charge us firstly for not turning up! They then followed this up with charging us for 3 nights! Unbelievable!!! We noticed this whilst staying at hotel and questioned several members of staff who displayed 100% incompetence in regards to sorting this out. When we left the hotel it still wasnt resolved and had to spend best part of £15 on british phone to find out they had refunded the wrong card! Again only spotted as we followed up.
Of all the hotels in New York I would strongly recommend looking at every other one first. We wouldnt have minded if they could have sorted this out on any of the several times we asked. At one point my girlfriend spent an hour talking to someone in reception to no avail and then realised that some brightspark had unauthorised our room cards whilst half way through stay.
Other things that was poor:
> Breakfast was pre paid and then we was told that it wasnt and had to get vouchers and redeem (breakfast is also massively overpriced)
> Had to ask 3 people for a plate for breakfast
> Room is tiny
> Hotel is really dark
I have stayed in 100's of hotels across the world and have never written a review but felt compelled by the worst service I have encountered to put this on here.

Tried to reach front desk for late check-out. The call was never answered. But since the phone was broken, maybe it never even rang at the desk!

"“do not stay here” I would not recommend staying here because of the headache of being over-charged. Here's what happened: We pre-booked and pre-paid 2 nights. We decided to arrive a day early (cancelled our trip to DC because of the hurricane), and were told that this would be an easy fix. It definitely was not. We noticed something wrong when we got an invoice on the 2nd day that was charging us for the 2 nights, when it should have been only for 1. We decided to speak to reception to fix it up. Instead of it being a simple issue, it took an hour to explain the issue and to have nothing resolved. We were also told that our pre-paid booking included breakfast, only to discover (after going for breakfast - OVERPRICED, no plates, coffee not so tasty) that it wasn't included. (To their credit, they did give us vouchers for it). We discovered that I was charged for a no-show fee even though we were in the hotel and in the exact same room. Then I was told I'd get refunded for the fee and then charged for the whole stay... the difference should be the amount for the 1 extra night that wasn't pre-paid. When we got back to the UK, I checked my visa card and found that they had then also charged me again for the no-show fee that they originally refunded me and gave my fiance the refund to his card.

"“Quite Happy” Booked into the Hudson for 2 weekends across August/September 2011. For the first weekend my flight into New York was cancelled due to hurricane Irene. The hotel was pretty helpful and had changed their cancellation policy to 'on-the-day' which was considerate and welcome.
We did make it there for the 2nd weekend which was for a wedding. The hotel turned out to be a great place to stay for a social event like this due to the excellent different social areas - the bar, the nightclub, the garden where we could all meet. Some people did mention the small size of their room. We booked a slightly bigger size (I think it was a superior queen) and the room was fine. They do have about 8 different types of room and yes the basic one is very small, but if you want more room book a bigger option for a few bucks more. I thought the value still pretty good for New York City. I didn't think Hudson Hall was great for breakfast, a bit overpriced. There is however a pretty good typical diner 50 yards away where we went on the 2nd morning (Flame coffee house). The rooms are perhaps getting a little bit tired and our bed was quite noisey.

“Given the circumstances...” We booked into the Hudson for two nights during Hurrican Irene. Given the chaotic circumstances I commend the Hudson staff for keeping a cool collective head and delivering good service at a difficult time. Because of a full shutdown of public transit there was no housekeeping and no room service available. Both good decisions given they were booked to capacity and everyone was stuck inside until the hurricane passed. I have no complaints. They did a good job. I would not however return to the Hudson because I think I'm simply too old for what the hotel offers. It is a nightclub with some rooms above.

however I spent there 3 days/2 nights . I did the reservation of my booking for the 1st night on the Hotel website and the second night on Trivago. At the check in I have informed about it the receptionist
The second day, returning back to the Hotel, I was really wet due to the pooring rain.. well I couldn't go into my room because it looked that I didn't left my credit card for the second night!! What?? I have already paid by credit card to the Hotel my first night.. so they had my details. It could be ok for meuntill in the conditions I was on line for more than 20 minutes at the front desk, full of people doing the check in ... but the final thing it was that the receptionist had to talk about my issue to the manager who was in charge to allow me to enter in the room. This last part took other 30 minutes-. So at the end for their mistake I stayed outside my room, waiting to get a shower for more than 2 hours ..........

"“Tiny rooms in a not-great location” We spent five nights in this hotel during the summer. The rooms were TINY. If you have any luggage at all, forget it - there isn't the space. Additionally, the common areas were quite shabby and smelled like cigarette smoke. 
Pros: it's right by the subway station at 59th St./Columbus Circle; Central Park; and a 15-minute walk from 5th Avenue.
Cons: You can't walk out your door and into a nice bar or restaurant; the tiny rooms!
And NOTE: they put a hold on your credit card of $150 per night in case of room damage which they didn't tell me about until AFTER I had made the booking - I was not impressed!",SheraDublin,2011-06-01,223023,2011-09-12,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“All the bad reviews are right” I stayed here for a week for my birthday. It was via a bid on Priceline who should be ashamed to send people to this hotel.

The big plus for this hotel is its location: a short walk to the subway and dozens of great restaurants on 7th and 8th Avenues.

"“Great location and ground floor. rooms were average.” So we were offered a four night stay at the Hudson as part of our wedding gifts. We stayed in a deluxe room.
As you get in you have to go up to the lobby by taking an elevator. the lobby has a great atmosphere even though there is poor light. The front desk is huge but is understaffed most of the time. anyway, our chek-in and check-out were made very quickly and we only had to wait when we had to ask the front desk to resolve some issues. so once you got your key you go up and i must say the corridors on all floors were a bit sad. the dark grey color is a bit unusual and you feel like being in a hospital, or a prison when you see these corridors and all the doors.
our deluxe room was of decent size, not that you could run around but neither was it a closet as read in some other reviews. that was probably due to the category. What stricken us was that the room was dark and ageing. the bathroom was kind of sad. the paint was clearly not white anymore, the drains did not work properly and the floor tiles seemed to be 50 years old.... another issue is the AC. we had to turn it off in order to sleep. but again, we europeans, are less used to AC in our bedrooms.
the safe in our room had a dysfunction and I could never get the front desk to fix it.
we received a bottle of sparkling wine when they learned we just got married and we were touched by the nice thought.
the concierge was very efficient and gave very good advice about restaurants. don't buy show tickets through them as their broker will rip you off.
we had breakfast once in the hotel. the restaurant is worth a visit.
we did not go to the club and we were never disturbed by it (we wre on the 12th floor).
there is a wonderful rooftop.
in the end the best thing about the hotel is its location just 3 minutes away from central park, close to broadway, close to a tube station. 
i would say that i was a bit disappointed by the rooms but hey, this is NY, so basically you're never in your room!! you can stay at this hotel and be out all day and then enjoy the restaurant and bar/club or the rooftop on a sunny day. you just need not to be too demanding on the quality of the rooms.",dlerital,2011-08-01,223023,2011-09-07,False,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Stylish but quite dim round the edges” I stayed here just before thanksgiving last year and wasn't expecting the Ritz due to reviews I read. The staff were really nice and helpful and the concierge helped us out alot. 
The hotel is very chic and stylish, however I feel that isn't enough to entice you back. The rooms were very small for 2 people sharing. The bathroom again is the size of a cupboard, and there is no storage space. Are all NY rooms like this? If so then I guess it isn't that relevant. 
The bed was comfy and cleaned daily but I feel the lack of natural light makes for a dingy and dull room! Event eh corriders are dull!
Location is the hotel's major plus point. Just a block from central park (if that) and lots of shops, restaurants and bars on your door step. 
It was about a 20-30 minute walk to time square, but we came to NY to explore on foot so that was fine with us, and it is a very pretty walk at night!

"“Style over content” We arrived just before the hurricane so the hotel was very full. We were given an upgrade but our room was in need of refurbishment, the ceiling was crumbling and the bathroom so small that my knees touched the wall when on the loo!!
We were on the 4th floor and our window didn't fit properly so we had thrumping music from the bar every night until 12.30 pm. The bar on the roof looked lovely but was closed due to the weather. I am sure that when open it would be a stunning place for a drink.
There was a little bit of hanging space for clothes but nowhere to put everything else so we lived out of our suitcases.
We tried to extend our stay as the hurricane was due to hit on the day we were checking out. The hotel couldn't accommodate us and were very unhelpful about where we could go. Luckily we changed hotels as we found an absolute gem at City Club Hotel.
They also messed up our friend's booking so they didn't have a room for when she arrived. Luckily they managed to fit a pull out bed into our room (just!) so she had somewhere to sleep.

"“Interesting hotel, small clean comfortable rooms” I got upgraded from a standard double to a superior king. The hotel itself was a bit of a rabbit warren, long dark narrow hallways.

I also got given a breakfast voucher when I checked in, but this hadn't been recorded in the system so my room number alone wouldn't let me have breakfast. This was frustrating.

"“Being greeted with a parking ticket was unpleasant” I arrived on Tuesday August 30th and the sidewalk in front of the hotel was being replaced so there was no where to park my car during check in. I parked just east of the barricades in front of the hotel. I returned to the car less than 10 minutes later after check in and there was a $115 parking ticket on it. I asked the front desk clerk if there was anything he could do but was told no. I travel in NYC very often and understand the parking problems but during the reconstruction in front, the hotel should have made some provisions to allow you to stop your car without being ticketed. I have stayed at this hotel before so I knew what to expect regarding room size but I had forgotten how nice the publc spaces are. The courtyard is breathtaking and the library and sky terrace are beautiful. Because of a change in my plans I had to extend my stay a third night. I moved from my original room to room 928. In the bathroom in that room I found the toilet was unusable. As mentioned in previous reviews there was not enough room between the toilet and the wall to allow you to sit on the toilet. Apparently previous guests that had wedged themselves on to the toilet had loosened it from the floor so much that it wobbled badly and was very unstable. Not wanting to change rooms again I simply used the restroom in the lobby. Overall I really like the hotel because of the design, staff and location.

"“Very small rooms but great outdoor spaces & conveniently located” We got this room as an Expedia Unpublished rate, so we didn't see the hotel name until after we booked it. (We only got to choose the hotel ""star"" rating in advance). Once we saw the reviews on it, we were very concerned. My husband is 6'5"" and I'm 5'9"" so we were worried about the comments we read about the rooms being VERY small. 
The rooms were indeed small, but were well-organized to make the most of the space. We spent 5 days in NYC and the location was fantastic. Very close to Central Park (only a block away) and close to Times Square so we had no issues walking all over the place. The location was great, bathroom was VERY small and my husband and I had to sit a bit askew to use the bathroom as our knees hit the wall as the toilet was that close to the wall. The best part were the two outdoor bar/lounge areas of the hotel. They were beautiful and very fun! Great seating spaces, not overly busy, and offered fantastic views of NY.
Pros:
1. Outdoor spaces were great. Two separate outdoor spaces for guests that offered comfortable seating, wait staff, and fun vibe.
2. Location: close to Central Park and easy walk to Times Square for those that like to walk.
3. Friendly staff, including housekeeping. 
4. Good housekeeping staff--kept amenities like shampoo/conditioner, etc. well-stocked for us.
Cons: 
1. disorganized check-in process. Just a huge open lobby so you're lucky if you hit it at a time when they are not busy as it can get hectic.
2. Club open to public on weekends: VERY LOUD club atmosphere in the lobby on weekends as they have a dance club open to public. We luckily had a room facing away from that area, so it wasn't an issue, but if you don't like that kind of thing, you may be turned off. However--best part of this was that they do have a separate entrance for the non-hotel guests so they do check room #'s/keys before allowing people up the escalator on those evenings.
3. Room size was small--VERY small. However, we weren't in our room enough for it to be a major issue for us.
4. Elevators are very, very slow. And once you got one, inevitably, there would be 14 people already crammed on it. They have approximately 6 elevators, but I think only 2 of them were working at any given time for all guests, and there are a TON of rooms in this place.
6. Hallways are very dark, to the point that it's a bit frightening. Seriously--this is like something you'd see in the movie Hostel. Very dark.
With all that being said, we WOULD STAY HERE AGAIN. The dark hallways and elevators were not enough to scare me away, and I thought they managed the club environment well. The great outdoor spaces and the clean rooms (albeit small) were nice enough to meet our needs, so we would go back to Hudson. Manager on duty was very nice and was pitching in on check-in frequently, so seeing that made me see that he was working to help some of the minor issues this hotel experiences.

"“Dark, small rooms, understaffed” Now let me first say that I stayed there during Hurricane Irene, so some of their staffing problems could have been (and probably were) caused by the fact that the hotel was pretty full and the staff couldn't get there. That said, the staff didn't seem eager to get customers into their rooms or checked out too quickly. I stood in line for 15 minutes while one staffer counted out money to a befuddled European tourist and the other was giving detailed directions on what to do and where to go in NY. All I wanted to do was check out!
The internet was non-existent, the restaurant expensive and not very good with long waits and uncomfortable seats that resembled cafeteria-style buffet service. Despite this they were ""nice"" enough to include suggested tips of 15, 20 and 25%. 25% for a guy who brings you a drink while you have to get your own food?
The room was nearly as small as the bed. The toilet so small it was hard to sit down. I felt like a giant in this place. Everything was dark with little seating in the lobby. The bar was a nightmare with tourists cutting the line and drinks that were priced at obscene levels. 9$ for a Heineken.
I will say the staff was friendly, if not very helpful or knowledgeable, the room was clean (although because of the hotel not made up on the 2nd day). The bed was stiff, cheap and uncomfortable but the pillows were feathered and fantastic. 
I would recommend staying elsewhere while in NYC. There are much better places.",Carbfree,2011-08-01,223023,2011-08-31,False,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Funky, noisy, dark.” We'd read the reviews and knew the rooms were small. As a family of four, we reserved a ""double-double"" which gave us two queen sized beds in a room with a small amount of additional space for luggage and a small bathroom. Basically, the size of a family room at a Premier Inn if that helps...
Various impressions....
We were on the 17th floor facing the courtyard. The room was VERY noisy from the 15th floor skybar. We expect some noise as we're in a city, but this was much noisier than we would have expected. 
Decor - all of the public rooms and bedrooms are very dark - lots of dark brickwork, dark wood etc. To this, the management have added little in the way of lighting - many corridors are almost totally dark. Bring a torch! Lifts and public area have a nice line in 1980s alternative music!
Maintenance - we had a problem with a bedside lamp which would not switch off. Reception/maintenance were useless at fixing it - we called three times to get someone to fix it - eventually fixed it myself and then had someone call an hour after we went to bed having told them not to call!
Bars, reception - excellent.
Staff - generally an excellent welcome and very helpful. Not nearly enough consierge staff as there was always a queue waiting for assistance....
Despite the above issues, we'd stay again, but bring earplugs and a torch - hotel was good though, location brilliant for subway and Central Park.",jockblue,2011-08-01,223023,2011-08-30,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Fab & funky hotel, good location.” Our stay at the Hudson was amazing and I've been meaning to leave a review ever since as many of the reviews we read before our trip were very mixed. This hotel is young and funky, there is a bar/club on site which is pretty expensive - $26 for a glass of wine and beer but it clearly pulls in a good crowd and for our first night, with a late arrival time, this suited us well. Good location, close by to Central Park and Broadway which meant we were in easy walking distance to most of the main attractions. Staff were always on hand and helpful, didnt experience any noise in the rooms either. Yes they are small but unless you have a LOT of money to spend, I'd say this was average for NYC. They were clean, contemporary and comfortable. Roof terrace beautiful but again expensive.

"“There are trade offs - but it's cool & the location is amazing” If a big room or an amazing view is what you are after - you won't be happy here. 
But if you are willing to compromise space & light for a super cool Manhattan experience in a fantastic location - then this is perfect.
We read all about the small rooms so ""upgraded"" to a superior queen - which was still super small but workable and I think the bathroom was marginally bigger and thus small but again workable! 
It is very dark - but that's OK as when in the room we were sleeping or relaxing anyway - and there are so many options in terms of bars to go and sit and enjoy (although the drinks are SUPER expensive).
We were on the 5th floor so at night there would be loud music from the bar on Level 1 - BUT - we were so exhausted from walking around all day - we fell asleep without issue.
The service was great - concierge were VERY helpful with restaurant recos etc - but we did wait a while each time (as they are thorough with each customer).
We loved the uber cool environment & bars - and the location was fantastic (a few blocks from Colombus circle subway / shopping mall & central park south west corner).

"“Great staff, not my favorite hotel” I would rate the hotel a 1 or 2 star and the staff a 4 or 5 star. 
I have to tell you upfront that I am really used to ""Marriott"" style hotels so I think you will have to take that into account in this review. Like other reviewers, I found the rooms to be incrediby small. There were a number of things in the hotel that I personally found odd and somewhat frustrating. First of all, I must be stupid or something because it took me quite a few minutes to figure out how to turn off all of the lights in the room. Speaking of light, I found the rooms and lobby to be incredibly dark for my taste. Also, the air conditioning was right at the head of the bed so I found that it was just too loud while I was trying to sleep so I had to turn it off which of course made the room really warm. The other thing that I found frustrating was the noise that came from the bar level in the center of the hotel. I would say about half of the rooms at the hotel surround this bar level and so the music went right into the rooms. The first few days I was here I did not find it to be a problem, but the second last night there was a DJ and it was really loud. 
The next day I asked about the noise and asked if it would be like that for my last night. Since it was going to be loud again, they were incredibly nice and offered to move me to a room on the outer side so I would not have a problem (in fact I have to say that every time I saw or spoke one of the staff members they were always very friendly). It seems as though the nights that have a DJ are really unpredictable so you never know if you are going to get the noise. In either case, you might want to try to get a room on the outer side so you don't have the problem. 
I don't think I will come back to this hotel, but I suspect there are a number of people that would enjoy this type of hotel.",Duffer467593,2011-08-01,223023,2011-08-29,False,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Great location, great facilities, great value A+” We were skeptical about staying here given the feedback on this site but we followed the General Manager's advice and contacted him directly at the time of booking. I'm glad we did as we have been looked after in every sense. Our party consisted of four adults (one couple, two singles so we had a single room and a ""double-double room"").
The common areas are unbelievable. Heaps of room, gorgeous hip decor, and enough people to create an atmosphere. There are older guests here but the place is perfect for young people wanting to party a little. The 15th floor has an amazing outdoor rooftop bar area that you can sit and read in as well.
We were told rooms in NY hotels were tiny but our rooms have been massive. Some have had small bathrooms but who cares if the other areas are good! The decor is very modern and is different from the usual staid big-chain hotel look.
The hotel is about 300m from a major subway stop and is easy walking distance to Central Park. You can walk to Fifth Ave etc but bring flat shoes.

"“Terrific Hotel in a Terrific Location” I really dont understand why this hotel has been given so many negative reviews, I just can't agree! 
The Hudson has a fantastic funky feel about it, modern design, pleasant staff and is positioned in the most ideal location of New York City! Just far enough away from the busy streets but only a short stroll to the main attractions such as Times Square and Central Park!
I booked the hotel for a getaway to treat the missus for her birthday and after reading what people has said, i understandably feared the worst! Maybe things have improved overnight here but everything we could have wanted was right there!
On the room front, if the sqaure footage is anything to go by then the standard rooms maybe small, but the difference in cost from standard to superior is small, and a stay in room 1850 will certainly leave you smiling! Too many moaners for me and lets be honest, how much time do you really want to spend in the room when you are exploring such a beautiful city!
Every member of staff I spoke to was more than happy to help from receptionists to luggage handlers!

"“Phenomenal Service; Tiny Room; Chic Hotel” Great service can cure a whole variety of shortcomings. In the case of the Hudson Hotel, the rooms are so small that they have to be part of the headline of any thorough review. More on the rooms in a minute. Upon arrival, we entered the unmarked door and took the escalator up to the lobby level. We approached a very friendly, inviting front desk clerk and asked if we were in fact in the right place. She cheerfully assured us that we were and began a first-class, professional check-in. She already had me on her team. I asked about the bed situation, since I knew from my Priceline.Com confirmation that we were booked in a double bed. We were promptly upgraded to a queen size bed at no extra charge. That was lucky, because I'm a big guy, and I don't think that both my wife and I could have used a double bed at the same time.
We headed up to the room and discovered that the reviews were right: the rooms are very small; barely bigger than the bed. Luckily we were only there for one night and had no luggage. If we had any bags, we would have been tripping over them, and there was hardly any place to have done any unpacking.
Also, there is a funky setup with the bathroom, where one wall of the bathroom is glass, fronting on the bedroom. When the shower curtains are open, all of the business that goes on in the bathroom is on display to the bedroom. There is a semi-sheer curtain on the bedroom side of the glass, another one on the shower side and a third one between the toilet and the shower. When they're all closed, there is a fair amount of privacy. When they're all open, it's an exhibitionist's dream.
Room size and glass wall aside, the room is quite nice and very clean. The linens are crisp white with no gross bedspread. Good selection of TV, including free premium channels.

"“Location, Location, Location!” We've got mixed reviews about the Hudson. The location, for us, was perfect. Located right near the southwest corner of Central Park and Columbus Circle, we were within easy walking distance from many of the tourist attractions that New York has to offer. Plus, the subway, with multiple lines, was only one block away. We stayed in their ""next to cheapest"" room and we were aware that the room would be small. If you are a larger person, pay for the bigger rooms as the bathroom, especially, was tiny. We stayed for 7 nights. The rooms were clean and air conditioned, the bed comfortable, and we had no complaints in this area. However, the elevators were slow and ""iffy"", our safe deposit box didn't work (we called about this our first day and were told that the battery needed to be replaced...it never was); the ice machine on our floor didn't work and were told by house keeping that it had been that way for more than a week. Food and beverages were expensive. Wi-fi cost $10.00/night unless you went to the Sky Terrace and signed in from there each day. The decor was trendy but a bit dark in the corridors. The staff was friendly and helpful but the bartender in the Sky Terrace was not adept in making cocktails...one tasted like watered-down kool-aid ( at $16.00/cocktail it was disappointing but we were offered a free drink afterwards).

Bed, well a camping bed is more comfortable. No room service and no restaurant for lunch.
Unless you are looking to drink your meals, stay elsewhere. And for the price, there are plenty of other options in NYC.

"“Claustrophobic and Pitch Black - Just what you want for a Honeymoon!” The Hudson hotel in New York City is classed as a 'boutique' hotel but with 15 floors and hundreds of hotel rooms all identical you can hardly class it as 'boutique'. We stayed here because it was close to our wedding venue in Central Park. 
On first arrival it is very hard to tell that it is the Hudson hotel with no visible markings or signs outside. Then you are greeted with huge glass doors which open the wrong way for pulling luggage through. Then the escalators and green glow of the paint and lighting which make it feel like you are entering a cinema or shopping centre.
The entire hotel lobby is cloaked in fake ivy making it incredibly dark, even in the midday sun. There are lots of little nooks and crannies and comfy chairs which always seemed to contain someone asleep in them (no suprise considering the consistent darkness!) The staff were very polite and helpful although my parents had to wait 4 hours for their room the be ready.
The biggest suprise and indeed dissapointment came when we got to our room. To say the room was shoe box like was an understatement. It consisted of a narrow corridor into the room with a hanging rail for clothes and then basically a bed, a small walkway around the bed with a desk at the end and then a glass wall which was the back of the shower! The bathroom was ridiculously small and it would be true to say that knees touched the wall whilst on the lavatory!. The shower consisted of a small tray and two curtains, one for the inside of the bathroom and one to cover the glass wall in the bedroom.
The whole hotel continued to be cloaked in darkness and whilst the bar lounge was a little more illuminated, the price for a bottle of corona or any beer left jaws on the floor. $18 for 2 drinks and then tip meant that each time $20 lighter in the wallet!
Then there was the noise from the disco on Fridays and Saturdays. To say we were on the 11th floor the music and talking was crystal clear!
Seems like I am complaining about most things but it was a very dissapointing experience for our wedding and honeymoon. The place was clean and tidy and the staff were polite and helpful and if you like living like a mole person in perpetual darkness then this is the place for you!
If you however like larger rooms, peace and quiet in the early hours and competitive bar prices, look elsewhere.

Please know your square footage when booking a hotel room, otherise, do not complain when you check in at the Hudson after booking a basic Queen bed room. It's NYC and space is limited. And by the way, the Hudson does a very good job with space management. Yes, the TV is high up, but are you staying to watch TV in your hotel room all day? I sure hope not. If you are in the city for a business meeting or for business reasons, do not stay here. If you are, pay extra for a bigger room and a high floor. We saw every age group at the hotel throughout the weekend.
We read reviews and check out websites before booking. Another tip would be to book with the hotel directly. Anyone, I have ever spoken to in reservations or at the Hudson has been very sweet.

The check in was slow and we had to wait for 2 hours for our rooms to be ready. The rooms were very small and only had a small space between the bed and the walls. The bathroom was also very small and the bath had the paint peeling off the bottom of it. 
We didnt dine in the restaurant as it was very very expensive. Luckly the hotel was near to some cafes which we ate in reguarly. (Very nice food and reasonably priced)
The bar area was ok the drinks a bit pricey but typical of hotels.

"“The Hudson (aka The Honeymoon Ruiner)” In early June 2011, my husband and I celebrated our honeymoon in NYC and we were excited to spend our time in the Big Apple at the Hudson Hotel. Our excitement was quickly diluted by the ineptitude of this hotel staff. At our check-in, they had lost our reservations, and we had to wait 2 hours before they could get us a room (mind you, after a full day of flying we were more than exhausted). The next day, after a day of tourning, we were locked out of our room. The front desk apparently had never checked us in and had given our room to someone else. After standing at the front desk for about an hour, the staff finally figured out and apologized with a voucher for 2 free drinks, (because that fixes their errors). 
In August, almost TWO MONTHS LATER, my bank account was drained and charged by The Hudson. When they were contacted they said their was no reason for this, as everything had been paid on Priceline in May; however, they did not return the funds to my account. 
All this aside, the rooms were terrible- small, dirty, dated. Nothing worked, and the hotel was absolutely unwelcoming. We were so disappointed and could not wait to leave.

"“Rooms like coffins” There are some good aspects to the hotel...if you don't sleep there. The pool room bar, outside courtyard, main bar area, and restaurant are all very unique and fun to explore.
However, everywhere you go it is almost pitch black! Some of the corridors are literally so dark you worry you'll bump into someone as you walk.
Then the rooms...wow, horrific. I paid for an upgrade to a Queen Delux. I shudder to think how small a standard room must be. Mine was the size of a postage stamp, with no hanging room, dark wooden floors, floor to ceiling dark wood paneling, and an air-con unit like a jet engine. The bathroom was dank, small, and grim. But the worst part was again the lighting. In the middle of the day it was so dark with just light from the bedside lamps and 2 ceiling spot lights, that I had to take my bag to the window to find anything in it. The bed was tiny and about 10cm off the ground too.
Overall, a horror show. I struggled through the first night, then checked out early and walked to a hotel up the road for the remaining 3 nights of my stay.",Tim C,2011-08-01,223023,2011-08-09,False,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“In the dark!” Our first experience of the Hudson Hotel was when we pulled up in a cab outside a building with no name/sign. Upon entering the hotel we went up the escalators and made our way, in the dark, to a desk with no name/sign where we were abruptly told we were at the wrong desk and promptly directed to what we both had assumed was a bar! We were swiftly checked in and when I enquired about the possibility of getting a doctor for my sick boyfriend I was told there would be a telephone number in the directory in the room. After searching in the dark fot the call button for the escalator we eventually made it to the 18th floor. This is when I actually started to worry as the decor was reminicant of a prison (dark grey corridors that badly needed re-plastering with white doors). As I open the door to our room, it hit the wall with a thud and bounced back at me. We entered the smallest hotel room I have ever experienced to find there was nowhere to store our clothes. As far as getting a doctor- the directory in our room didn't even have information on the hotel restaurant/ bars nevermind a number for a doctor! I rang the front desk and the man who answered clearly paniced when I asked could I get in touch with a doctor and eventually decided he would contact the manager. The concierge desk then phoned and asked for my boyfriend's symptoms. Several phonecalls later and a doctor was on his way. The only member of staff to enquire about my boyfriends condition during our 5 night stay was our housekeeper! We banged our shins daily on the corners of the bed. We had to reverse into the bathroom to use the toilet and had to dry ourselves in the bath as there was no space anywhere else in the room. The lobby of the hotel contained no tourist information.

"“The worst hotel stay ever” I spend about 80-90 nights a year in hotels. The Hudson by far is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Here's why;
The rooms are tiny, you are constantly bumping yourself on the furniture. 
The TV is mounted to high, which causes neck pain. 
The beds are in front of window & AC unit, you have to sleep with something over your head so you will not catch a cold. 
The bathtubs are old & dirty. 
Your knees hit the wall when you sit o the toilet.
In an emergency, two people heading of the door can easily get trapped as the hallway is not an arms length wide.
Hallways & lobby lightings are dim.
How NYC buildings dept allows this fire trap to operate as a hotel is baffling.",vatcpa,2011-08-01,223023,2011-08-06,False,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Exciting Urban Oasis” My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hudson in early July and what an experience. If you're into Chic - Urban design then this is the place for you, however, everyone from all walks of life will marvel at the undeniable beauty of this little gem, it's the perfect place to complete your NYC experience. It is situated moments from Columbus Circle and Central Park, which we found worked well as a base location. Our room carried the same urban motif as with the rest of the hotel, the space was comfortable and clean. The sky terrace on 15th is spectacular and the perfect tranquil place to put your feet up after a long day exploring the busy city, they even have bar service if you so desire. (note: our room was on 15th, just a couple doors down from the sky terrace, for added convenience try to get a room on this floor). The terrace/bar behind reception is just as beautiful and our understanding is that people come from all over just to enjoy cocktails in this perfectly designed space. Without question my next NYC trip will see me returning to the Hudson, it has everything you could ask for.

"“Friendliest and most accommodating staff in New York.” My daughter and I just left New York and we are both raving about the Hudson. The ambiance in the lobby and the bar was captivating. Our room was spotless and chic. Having Starbucks and Pinkberry right next door made us both so happy. But most memorable was how accommodating and gracious the staff was to us. From the moment our cab pulled up to the hotel we were treated like long lost friends from the bellhops, the front desk, the manager and even the housekeeping staff were engaging, helpful and friendly. They remembered our names and seemed truly interested in making our time spent there memorable and enjoyable. We will definitely make this our regular place to stay in New York.",Dziner27,2011-08-01,223023,2011-08-05,True,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Odd, but Fun” Took a getaway trip to NYC and stayed at the Hudson for 4 nights in May 2011. Booked the Hudson via PriceLine and was a bit leery due to the mixed reviews of the place on Tripadvisor. 
We are not picky and are used to having rooms in New York City being small. Rooms are small at the Hudson. I thought the decorating was kind of cool. The room was spartan in its furnishings and we would have like to have had a dresser for clothes. In this particular room, it might have been able to fit, too! 
The music was quite loud right up until 11:30 PM and the bass reverberated up to our 7th floor room, But, it is NYC, so who goes to bed early???
Reception staff was attentive to our needs and the Concierge was very helpful to give us directions to some of the local sites. We loved the location since we wanted to wander around Central Park. We had a great stay in the city and took in some of the cool local events. 
Don't miss the Jazz at Lincoln Center. That was wonderful as the Julliard Jazz faculty played for us at Dizzy's place. That was great. 
Overall, the hotel was adequate to our needs and the price was right via Priceline.
We visited Grimaldi's pizza via the subway-- a must for any visitor
We then walked the Brooklyn Bridge-- Also a must
We saw ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" -- wonderful
We also took the Staten Island Ferry at sundown-- Free!!

"“Great Location near Central Park & Subway” We stayed at the Hudson Hotel for six nights. On arrival we found the staff very helpful and friendly and check-in was a breeze. Our room was very clean although very small, but we were aware of this issue after we booked our 'mystery hotel' deal. Our bed was very large and very comfortable, the bathroom, although on the small side was also very clean. Our room was serviced everyday and we particularly liked the availability of the ice dispensing machine in hallway for cooling our drinks. The location of the hotel is a huge plus, located within 5mins walk of Central Park and the subway. It was also a very safe walk into Times Square area and for walking home from attending Broadway shows in the evening (approx 20mins). There is a pharmacy, diner and other amenities in close proximity and fab bagel stands within one block and across the road. 
The only down side to this hotel is the noise in the evening from the bar area which seemed to finish at midnight. We were not particularly bothered by this as we were out and about most evenings and did not get home to around midnight anyway-however, I could see that this could bother some people staying here. So if you are going to be tucked up in bed early in New York-this will not be the hotel for you! Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Hudson and thought it was good value for money and loved its central location.",Kiwifruitontour,2011-06-01,223023,2011-08-04,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great location and very clean!” We stayed at the Hudson for 8 nights. The rooms are indeed small but this is typical for New York. The washroom was the big thing I was nervous about but it wasn't as bad as other reviews might make it seem. Two people could fit in the showers just fine. Stepping over the toilet to get to the shower is not a hassle. While on the toilet my knees did not touch the walls, was mentioned by other reviews; then again I am 5'2"".
The hotel was very clean. On the third night we came back to our hotel and found a cockroach skittering away as we opened our door. My boyfriend killed the cockroach and we called the front desk. Although it did take them 30mins to get back to us, they were very accommodating to our concerns and gave us a free upgrade for the entire trip to a much larger room. As I mentioned before the hotel looked very clean so I don't think this is a common thing for them to have cockroaches.
The upgrade room was spacious and clean. We were very happy with the upgrade. The size of the bathroom was definitely a normal size =)
The location is most ideal! This hotel is walking distance (2min) from Central Park. It is also close to Columbus Circle Subway station for public transit users like myself. 
Overall I would definitely this hotel for anyone looking for a clean hotel with a great location.",Simplylulu6,2011-07-01,223023,2011-08-04,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Waiting, waiting, waiting....” Despite lots of staff around nothing seems to work here. Check-in is like being back in the USSR with long lines that barely move. Eventually you get to the desk and the standard response is ""sorry, room isn't ready!"" (accompanied by gleeful smile). They suggest you wait in the lounge behind check in. Unfortunately the bar there doesn't open until 5pm (even on a saturday). So you slepp to the library bar where the bartended promptly walks away when he sees you approaching. I have probably stayed in over 50 NYC hotels during the past 10 years and the Hudson Hotel is by far the worst.",ajb6210,2011-06-01,223023,2011-08-04,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“A Lot of Style and Not a lot of Substance” A cool lounge-y vibe permeates the entire property. That being said, I found it too dark and dank. The coolness extends to the check in desk, where you'd better keep your cool as you wait in line 30 minutes to hand someone your credit card just so they can hand you a room key. Seriously, management, why is there always a loong wait at the check in counter? If you think you're the hippest hotel in town, put in a kiosk and let us self check in and be on our way!
Now that you have your key, open the door to the tiniest of tiny rooms in all of NYC. Even the furniture has been imported from Lilliputian Land to fit into the toy doll house rooms. Your 7 year old might think it's cool, but wait until you lie on the bed, which is only inches above the floor. Throw me a rope and pull me out! Check out the image of the bathroom. It was so small that when I sat on the pot, I was forced to spread my legs or they would crunch the wall in front of me. I'm six feet, so anybody over average height and weight will have an issue. Here's my final take:
18-34 you might think this place is cool
35-49 you will probably not think this place is cool
50 and above you will wish you had booked the Holiday Inn Express
By the way, 3 calls to the front desk to try and get a remote for the TV.....I'm still waiting!",onedumgoy,2011-08-01,223023,2011-08-04,False,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Quirky Hotel probably best for couples” This is a very quirky hotel that is probably fine for some, but not everyone. The location is excellent. The public areas are very dark, and illuminated mainly by a weird yellow light. I suppose this is very hip, but it mostly seemed dark to me. I arrived at about 4 p.m. and no room was ready. The line at the check in counter is rather chaotic. I found the staff to be young and enthusiastic and fairly helpful. My room (a double double deluxe) was fine, but not great, with minimal furnishings. Parts of the bathroom were not well cleaned. Later I went up to the sky terrace. It is a fantastic space, though the bar service is outrageously expensive. There was a wide range of people staying at the hotel, many attractive young couples, many international, some families. Not so many business guests. My first night I did not sleep well. The AC was right in back of the bed and kept cycling on and off. When it was on I got cold and pulled up the heavy cover (no single sheet); when it was off I got hot. Why no single sheet guys! I was more comfortable after moving to the other bed. I was fine the second night. Our room had a nice view of 9th ave, but I can see that the courtyard facing rooms might be noisy, as there is an open air night club in the courtyard. So all in all, if you're looking for something really hip (or at least with hip pretentions) you might like the Hudson (especially if you can get a larger room); otherwise you might not. Finally, I gather that there is some potential for negotiating room rates in advance. Call and ask if there are any manager's specials, especially if you are getting more than one room.",57_Mercator,2011-08-01,223023,2011-08-04,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Different but we liked it” We got a very good discounted rate for a Queen Deluxe room. It was plenty big by NYC standards. Perhaps the Standard rooms are tiny, so I can't speak to those. Some people complained about the darkness of the hotel, but it was an interesting change! If you aren't open to something a little bit different, then you probably shouldn't vacation in NYC anyway. Olivia checked us in, and she was very helpful. The concierge and doorman were both good too. My wife thought the room needed to be brighter so she could find stuff in her bag more easily, but I had no issues with it. The bathroom was quite small, but manageable for one person at a time. The location was fantastic...one block away from Columbus Circle, Central Park, and a major subway station. The only serious drawback, depending on how you looked at it, was the music from the bar at night. However, it was over by midnight each night. You can ask for ear plugs if you're on a lower floor, but the sound from the air conditioner lulled us to sleep despite the music. Hey, it's NYC, so get with the groove! The rooftop bar area was a lush getaway, but the bar prices were a bit ridiculous. I think the hotel could actually earn more money if they lowered their prices so more people would eat and drink there. There was a good breakfast spot on the corner of 58th St, on the far side of 9th Avenue.",ry1nik,2011-08-01,223023,2011-08-02,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Nice hotel, great location - not a great experince though, let me tell you why” Hudson is positioned in a great location for discovering NYC. I absolutely Iove the building, the area and their terrace, although the bar is truly pricey and drinks variety and quality is not that good. 
There are a number of parties organized in the hotel (you will easily get crossed with one of them. Beware: most of these celebrations are very cheesy and frequented by white trash).
I booked with splendia and did not enjoy of room upgrade. On the contrary, my room was very small, there were tons of disgusting bugs and air conditioning was not working - so it was not a great room at all! I was not offered to receive any discount, drink or whatever (i didn´t like that!).
The bathroom was very very small and no view was avaialble from there.

"“Practical and utilitarian with the right degree of comfort, excellent location and connectvity” HUDSON HOTEL:
The Hudson is an excellent hotel for a quick business trip. It was my first trip to the US, and the hotel was on the conference website that I was presenting a paper in . It was my first solo trip and I was a bit apprehensive. 
The online booking was seamless , though I did contact them a number of times on phone and mail for a airport pick up but was unable to get the service. 
The check in time of 3:00 p.m was clearly mentioned , but for international travelers with flights arriving early morning , the 6 hour wait after a 20 hour flight is extremely taxing and HUDSON could make alternate arrangements . 
The location is excellent in the heart of the city with the metro station at walking distance and the central park so near I would take a morning walk each day before leaving at 7:00 a.m for the conference.
Service is satisfactory and unobtrusive. In fact you hardly see any staff. The completely unmanned business centre is a real eyeopener , especially in comparison to India where a dedicated staff would cater to the needs of the guest. 
The single room is too small and a solo guest is advised to take a double room. The room is extremely comfortable with modern interiors with warm wooden paneling on walls. 
the staff at the reception desk was extremely efficient and helpful attending to all my needs from changing the room after check in at a attractive rate, I only wish my request for an early check in was also taken care of , as spending 6 hours sitting in the lobby after a 20 hour flight was a torture. 
All and all if I were to come again solo I'd try this again , but if with family , I'd prefer a more cheerful and brighter property.",pokuban,2011-05-01,223023,2011-07-27,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Trendy hotel in a great location” We arrived in NYC on the hottest day of the year. Outside of the hotel young men dressed in all black were helping with bags and hailing cabs - you'd think the hotel would have let them wear all white when it was 102 outside, but oh well. The escalator up to the lobby was being repaired, so we had to enter at ground level, but there were employees inside with cold water and cold wet towels to cool us off. 
The room was smallish, with a 3/4 bed, but it wasn't too small, and the bed was comfortable, and the room was very cold when we walked in. The room was clean, with a small but nice bathroom and shower. Our view wasn't great, but the hotel has a rooftop bar with an excellent view. The room came with a desk, a flat screen TV, iron and ironing board, and a hair dryer in a bag hanging behind the bathroom door (my wife panicked a bit until we found it)
At night the lobby seemed more like a rave party, with loud music and strange green lights, but upstairs we were not able to hear any of the music below, so it wasn't an issue.
We paid around $125 a night, before taxes and fees, using Priceline. As I said, the hotel is trendy, perhaps overly so for our tastes, but in a great location, with clean, affordable rooms.

The rooms are small, but your in New York and shouldnt be spending too long in there anyway. they are clean and have a safe.
There is just enough room to walk around the bed. the beds are comfy though.
the bathrooms are tiny we travelled with friends and one of them is 6ft 5 + and he couldnt go to the toliet in the room so had to go downstairs by reception. 
Staff were friendly and did what ever we asked of them.
The skybar is nice and its big. i can see why the celebs go there. the other bars are nice too and are really busy on friday and saturday nights. 
i would say stay here if you like a clean modern hotel.

All this for the bargain price of only $350/ night including taxes. The room was nicely finished with wood floors and walls, but there was no closet, only a hanging rod next to the door.

"“A positive experience...” We recently stayed at the Hudson for 4 nights as we were getting married in NYC.
i must admit that i was slightly apprehensive after reading some negative reviews just before we flew out... but we loved it!. 
I had looked at the hotel website before hand so knew what the hotel looked like so the fact that it isn't signed outside wasn't an issue. 
I thought the escalator entrance, the lobby and reception looked fantastic as did the rest of the hotel. The room was fairly small but i had expected that with it being New York. The sky terrace is fantastic. We enjoyed many a cocktail up there with gorgeous views. Loved the great music that was playing...even in the elevators. We were on the 10th floor and it was quiet up there. so i can't coment on previous reviews of it being loud in the rooms. 
Every member of staff we spoke to was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were kept very clean, sheets changed daily and shower gels etc replenished daily.
Absolutely no complaints about this hotel and we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
So close to central park (which is where we got married so was very convenient for us) but also Columbus circle subway station is just at the end of the street :)",Weegem82,2011-07-01,223023,2011-07-22,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“DO NOT STAY HERE -- DO NOT STAY HERE” For openers, the hotel driving directions were in error. The hotel website noted to ""watch out for the bright green doors on W. 58th St.."" The doors must have been recently painted. This is the only hotel surface, inside or out, above, below or in the middle that has seen a paint brush, vacuum cleaner or sanitizer for quite some time. The darkened hotel lobby is a trip hazard for all guests that can walk. The hotel corridors remind one of a high security prison -- hot, humid and smelly. The rooms are more aptly described as medium size closets. If you are not a contortionist, moving about the room is dangerous to backs and limbs. And watch your head on the TV while getting out of bed. The bathroom cannot be entered or exited without brushing up against the toilet. Very pleasant. Our room AC stopped at 10 PM prompting a change of rooms. On the bright side, the location is great for a real hotel. Our room came with two free pitchers of mojitos. These would have come in handy around 10 PM. Also, free parking.

"“Just what we needed and location cannot be beat for the price!” Our room was on 12th floor. We bid on Priceline and won this hotel for $130 per night. My husband and I stayed here for three (comfortable) nights.
Yes, rooms are small but space is very efficiently used. Yes, some hallways and the lobby elevator area is dark but I could still see well enough to get along just fine. Almost every other guest we met here was from another country, especially a lot of British and French guests. We woke each day, went out, came back for afternoon nap, went back out, came back for a short time early evening, then went back out til late.
PROS:
Price couldn't be beat 
Prime location on Columbus Circle and Subway route
CLEAN
Great quality complimentary toiletries
Elevators plentiful and fast
Trendy and cool atmosphere
Flat screen tv and iPod dock in the room
Efficient use of space
Lots of hooks/ shelves and cubbyholes to store items
Large window with nice view
Free wifi in lobby area
Comfy beds with bright white clean linens & comfy pillows (four on the bed)
Nice ambient lighting in the room-perfect amount of light
Dark wood is beautiful and furniture is simple but sufficient
Beautiful lobby & elevator interiors
CONS:
Size is obviously small
Tub drained quite slowly
No a/c in elevators-quite warm!
No personal a/c controls in the room-was set to a default temp of ?
Little/no privacy between room occupants which wasn't a problem for us but might be for some
There is a charge for wifi if you want to use it in your room

"“I will not come back...” I love New York, and me and my boyfriend have recently spent a great week there. The only negative think about the vacation was the hotel. Nice design, great location, but tiny, tiny rooms (and even tinier bathrooms), very loud (we were sleeping with earplugs), and not very helpfull staff.
We asked if it was possible to swich rooms to get one that was more quiet. We would totally understand if it was not possible, but they said at it was ok. But in the afternoon when we came to pick our new keys nobody remembered about the deal. We had to unbpack our bags, wait to another day, and when we finally got new room it was even louder (just above the aircondition machinery for the whole hotel, I guess) and it smelled cigarettes.
I am so disappointed about this stay, next time in New York we will definetly choose a different hotel!",Villanden,2011-07-01,223023,2011-07-11,False,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“A little below average...wouldn't recommend it.” We stayed at the Hudson when our flight was cancelled and we needed a place to stay for two more nights in NYC. After ten hours in the airport, we were looking forward to getting back to a hotel. When we arrived at the Hudson, we weren't even sure it was a hotel. Take heed - the building that looks and sounds like a night club is actually the hotel. 
 The lobby and elevator area is very, very dark and loud. There is a huge front desk, but it seems only to be staffed by one or two people. The lines to check in and out were very long. The concierge desk was very helpful. 
 The room was tiny. Not small, tiny. My wife actually started laughing. If you are a bigger person, you probably would not want to stay at the Hudson. I'm not sure it would be possible for a bigger person to use the bathroom or shower. The room was decorated nicely. Though even with every light on, it was still a little dark for unpacking/packing, getting ready, etc. There was a flat screen tv mounted to the wall above one side of the bed, but even when the tv was pulled out from the wall, it was nearly impossible to see from the bed. The air conditioner was quite loud, but it turned out to be a good thing. If it hadn't been, the noise from the music from the courtyard or the roof would probably keep you awake. The room was very clean (except for the bathroom mirror). Speaking of clean, I was surprised to see doors with hand made ""do not disturb"" signs stuck to them. You will want to do the same. The hotel does not provide them. Each morning we were there, the door was opened by housekeeping while we were in bed. There was a brief knock, and then the door opened. Luckily, we had the chain on each time. 
 Okay, bottom line...I wouldn't stay here again. The common areas were nice (library, courtyard), but there are much better places to stay for your money.",aaronknueppel,2011-07-01,223023,2011-07-11,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
“Not what I expected” The hotel is dark which I like but at times it's too dark. The rooms are very small and we had a larger suite of the doubles. The line to check in was long. They have a club at the hotel however you have to get a bracelet which is inconvenient for guests of the hotel. They need to fix that problem. The club was not what I thought it'd be I expected way more it was like a bunch of people you'd see at the airport all hanging out together. Not really a club or lounge scene.,TropicalParadiseGOOO,2011-04-01,223023,2011-07-08,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Excellent Managers” My wife and I stayed here for our one year anniversary from 7/3-7/6. I made the reservation on Priceline, but could have booked for the same price via the Hudson website. Using the Hudson website, I emailed asking if would be possible to get a room higher up for our anniversary. I got no response, so I emailed again with the same result. I was expecting the hotel to say it was not possible, but to ignore me was impolite. I ended up getting in contact with a manager who went above and beyond expectations, setting aside room 1448 (on the 14th floor) and even sent an anniversary gift for us. 
Now for the room:
Everything was very clean (and my wife does check EVERYTHING). The towels each had small stains on them, which I didn't even notice, but my wife did and housekeeping promptly brought 4 new, clean towels. The room wasn't large, but was definitely big enough for the two of us and the two suitcases, neither of which would be considered ""carry-on"" size for an airline. There are modern, artsy ""reading"" lights on either side of the bed and a long light behind the headboard. There were mirrors on either side of the bed, with a flat panel Sony tv on one side. There was a small desk, chair and lamp at the end of the bed. And here's the interesting part - dividing the bed area and the bathroom is a floor-to-ceiling glass panel. There are curtains on either side, but if both are open, you have a full view of the shower from the bed. There was also a small closet with hangers, an iron, and small ironing board. We had free wifi in the room. It wasn't fast, but to quickly check email or find a phone number/address, it was great. There is an option to pay to upgrade the speed. Each time you connect it lasts 24 hours, but you can just connect again for free every 24 hours if you need.
The hotel:
We didn't do much in the hotel other than sleep and relax during the day for a bit. Everything was very clean and the bars/restaurants looked interesting. We did have a drink on the Sky Terrace one evening with each drink being $16. The drinks were fine, the view and chairs were great. There was loud music on the Sky Terrace probably starting at 10 pm (I'm not sure, I don't think we were ever there when it started), but it did end around midnight. The one night we went to bed before midnight, we had no trouble falling asleep with the music going. Although if you are a very light sleeper, maybe you ask for a room further from the Sky Terrace. Lastly, the hallways were a bit dated and dirty feeling, but I don't sleep or relax in the hall, so I didn't care.
Location:
We've never stayed on the West Side, but the the hotel is very close to plenty of things. The closest ""attractions"" would be the Columbus Circle/Time Warner Center and Central Park. There's a Whole Foods in the Time Warner Center and another grocery store about 1 block east if you want to picnic. There's a Duane Reade pharmacy also about 1 block east. There are plenty of subway lines available at Columbus Circle and there's another stop at 57th and 7th (N, Q, R I think - maybe just N and R). There's a Starbucks, Pinkberry and Subway all no more than 2 blocks east, and plenty of local places just as close, including Sushi Damo and a cafe or three (Coloseum, Europan).

"“Down the drain...” This is my third stay at the Hudson after Priceline biddings. Although it has a wonderful location, the hotel quality is going down the drain!  So:

If you want to have problems almost every day with your room card key, go to Hudson hotel.
If you don’t need your room telephone to work, go to Hudson hotel.
If you want to get a rude, unpolite treatment at the hotel reception desk, after complaining about all those absurd situations, go to Hudson hotel.

"“Great Hotel, loved it!” I purchased our room through Priceline. I was a little worried with the reviews I had seen on line. It is listed as a ""Boutique hotel"" which Wikipedia states is intimate, usually luxurious or quirky hotel environments. This hotel was all that and more! The rooms are very small but the design of the room and the use of the space available makes them seem larger. I love the hardwood floors in all the rooms, much better than nasty hotel carpeting! 
The customer service at this hotel was phenomenal ! I had read that the employees were worried more about looking good than helping the customers. We did not find this to be the case at all! There was always someone at the front desk to help and everyone went out of their way to make sure our stay was good.",wengard2414,2011-07-01,223023,2011-07-07,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Is this a pod hotel?” Trendy lobby and bar areas that maybe try a little too hard. Eighties theme in the hallways that is more tacky '80's than trendy '80's. And, as many reviewers have commented, tiny, tiny, tiny rooms. The internet was free though, so that helps a little. I thought my bathroom was pretty small but that's before I read these reviews--apparently I lucked out with a real tub, decent water pressure, and a toilet that faced into the bathroom so could be used comfortably. And, my A/C worked fine. However, on the 15th floor just next to the roof deck, it wasn't fun to find the deck closed to the public on July 4. The front desk was very accommodating when I checked in and the attendant thanked me for not yelling at him because of the long wait--I guess he's used to taking the crap for the inefficiency of the general front desk operation. Still, the amazingly small room was just too much to handle, so after three nights I moved to another hotel where I had just as good a location. Had to call the desk a couple of times, once to try to get housekeeping to come, and for a few other small issues, and each time the phone rang off the hook to no answer, so I had to make the trek downstairs to speak to someone in person.

"“Look Elsewhere” I wanted to like this trendy, Euro-Wierd looking hotel. I did not. I was there on business and it began with check-in. You are faced with a stunning carved long wooden desk in an atrium.
Despite its size, there were 2 people checking people in, no lines, just people milling around wondering what to do or where to find assistance. I stood there for 20 minutes while they checked in 2 couples ahead of me.
Then I found out that they charged both me and my client (who had made the reservation) for the same reservation. Several phone calls from me and my client is supposed to resolve the issue, we'll see. I'm sure it will be fine but a pain.
The room was tiny. A small rectangle, quite pretty with a good bed , good linens.
From the bed you looked at a small but adequate desk and a ceiling to floor window that reveled the shower and toilet, hidden by a translucent curtain.
Cooling was provided by a loud unit directly on the other side of the headboard. For me to sleep there were 2 choices, on again off again a/c fan or quiet and airless.
My knees touched the wall when I sat on the toilet. Sorry for the graphic but scale needs to be appreciated.

"“Perfect for me, but not for everyone” I love when a hotel isn’t just a standard room with the standard bed, lounge chair, and bathroom. I can see how not everyone would appreciate visiting the hotel only to lose creature comforts like a plush rug or a high, cushy bed. But that is what I love about it. I love the details that make your eyes wander around the lobby, made me curious to flip over everything in the room, and made me appreciate how different this hotel was. In fact, it felt like my bizarro New York apartment that was dark and smoldery, but had key design features like a window between the bed and bathtub, or a hot silver desk with a clear plexi chair. I’ve stayed here 4 times now and no two room layouts have been the same reinforcing the idea that this was an old New York building converted to a modern hotel. I really dig this contrast aesthetically, but psychologically, it also makes me feel comfortable because it feels more like a pied a terre. The location also works for me because I’m a regular in NY and I didn’t need a central location to the tourist spots, but its location is very convenient to public transportation making it easy for me to get around. 
However, while I love it, not everyone will. It is dark and minimal and some rooms are quite small even for NY standards. It also lacks the convenience of a fridge in the room and doesn’t have the best temperature control. While staying there in the winter my heater wouldn’t shut off making it unbearably hot. Surprisingly, there is such a thing when the temperature outside is in the single digits. Another gripe is that the sheets are not uber soft, or a million thread count with the fluffiest goose down feather pillows. The elevators are sloooowwwww. I will admit the hotel is not perfect.
For me though, I’ve learned to look past the imperfections because I’ve grown to like the hotel, its design, and its courteous staff. I definitely have no complaints in that department. Would I recommend this hotel to my mother in law? No. Would I recommend this to my friends?

“Another amazing weekend in New York and at the Hudson” I just got back from another trip to New York where I had another amazing stay at the Hudson - my favorite hotel in New York. I got in early Friday and although no promises were made they accommodated me with a check-in at 2pm. Found the room to be in perfect order when I arrived and enjoyed a nice afternoon nap on the comfortable bed. The energy of the hotel can not be beat where you always feel like you are staying at the most exciting place in New York. Within easy walking distance of Columbus Circle it was very easy for me to get on the Subway and head down to Chelsea for dinner with friends. The location can not be beat and after some long days of activity it was great to come back and enjoy a nice relaxing night in my room.

"“It was perfect for young couples on holiday!” After reading some of the reviews on here, we were very worried that it might turn out to be a dive, but we were very pleasantly surprised. We took the advice of others on here and emailed in advance to request a high floorlevel to avoid street and bar noise and we didn't hear a thing on the 23rd floor. We also had a superior queen, which meant that the room's size was not an issue at all, so we would recommend this. The bathroom was lovely and clean and every day they provided more toiletries. Room was cleaned every day and was decorated in a very quirky way! Corridors are dark, but it fit with the style of the hotel. The sky Terrace was gorgeous and very chilled, the outdoor area downstairs was cute, quirky and comfortable, and there was a pool table in the library along with chess sets! Staff were very nice to us. We didn't go to the bar because that's not our thing, but we heard very good things about it. We went to New York to be tourists and see all the sights and this hotel was in a fab location and very comfortable in the evenings, which was the only time we were really there. We even got a complimentary bowl of fruit! We were so impressed, we'd definitely stay here again.

"“Nice hotel, small rooms, TERRIBLE STAFF” This is my very first time ever writing a review for any hotel, restaurant, etc. We stayed at the Hudson this past May. Our first room was SO small that we upgraded to a large room, which was very nice. The front desk asked me to pack up our belongings and the bellman would move our luggage while we were gone during the day. I left a $10 tip for him on the bed. Later in the day I realized I wasn't wearing the necklace I wear every day. I remembered I left it on the small counter that the sink was on and forgot to pack it. Right away I called the front to let them know I left it in the room. They said they would check with house keeping and get back to me....never happened. I called again and they said they would check with security and get back to me....never happened. Right when we got back to the hotel we spoke to the front desk and they said they would have their manager call me.....never happened. Over the next 3 days of our trip I spoke with the staff numerous times and no one would help me. It was a very expensive and special necklace to me. I understand it is my fault for leaving it by the sink but no one would even help me and they were rude about it.

"“Would NEVER stay here again” I unfortunately cannot leave a positive review about this hotel. First of all, the desk staff is not very personable to say the least, second the hallways are long and dark, very unsettling in a large city. Lastly, the room itself... The only good thing I have to say was the bed was comfortable. The room is so horribly small you can hardly move if you have 2 people in it. No exaggeration. With our luggage out we had to hop over it to get on the bed. I have never been one to feel claustrophobic before I stayed here, this was my first time feeling that way, ever. The bathroom has a sheer curtain dividing the bed/sleep area and shower- you can see everything thru it. No privacy whatsoever in this room. I felt horribly cramped whenever I was in here and could not wait to get back outside. Because of this, we stayed out late every night of our stay. We also woke early and left right away to get out of this cramped space. I would never, ever stay here again, unless it was a free stay. Very uncomfortable hotel. On the plus side, when you walk up to the lobby area, it is very pretty and the celling is covered in greenery. Judging by this I would have thought the rooms would have been much nicer.

"“Honey, I Shrunk The Room!” We were ""lucky"" enough to ""win"" this hotel on Priceline. That said...
CON (there is only one):
-The room size: Our room (#729) was ungodly small. Calling it ""cozy"" would do all other cozy things injustice. Smaller than any room I have ever stayed in, smaller than any room I have ever slept in (some closets and bathrooms included). I am cheap, that is why I Priceline rooms; HOWEVER, I would've gladly paid an extra $100/night to stay anywhere else. 
The bed is comfortable, but it encompasses 80% of the room space. There is about a foot on either side of the bed, so in order to move on the side with the TV hanging off the wall, one has to do their best version of the limbo to get around. By the end of our stay, we were just walking across the bed to get around- it becomes the practical thing to do, even if you haven't walked on a bed in your adult life. The bathrooms are even tinier- if you are overweight, don't bother trying to get around in there. 
PROS:
-The service: The service was quick, even if it was a plate of $40 bacon and eggs. Our maids did a good job, too, because has to be tough to maneuver around a tiny room, but the room was spic and span every night. We requested 2 towels and they were there in five minutes. The bellhops were quick to help as well and get a cab if you needed it (even if it meant running into the middle of the street to hail one down).
-Proximity to key points: The hotel is a block from Central Park. It is also very close to the subway and a Subway.
-The ambiance: The hotel is super trendy, you'll see that the minute you walk in. 
-The patio: We weren't able to spend time on the patio, but we wished we did. The patio is well-shaded and would be the PERFECT place to relax and enjoy an assuredly $10 beer.
All in all, we wouldn't recommend it because of the room size, but everything else about it was pretty nice.",parforethecourse,2011-06-01,223023,2011-06-14,False,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

Same for a simply dressed bed--just sheets--that get laundered after each guest. No duvets, no shams, etc. Staff was very helpful. Venues (bars, terraces, etc.) were fun and interesting.

“Not for senior travellers” We are two couples in our mid sixties and found the rooms in this hotel too small and unsuitable for older bodies. The beds were very low with minimal room around them (very hard to find space for two cases) and the bathrooms tiny and difficult to utilise. It was also quite dark in the open areas around the reception. On a positive note the guy on the front desk at checkin was most helpful and the garden bar was pleasant and very groovy. In addition the rooms were clean and ours not too noisy although the couple we travelled with had a room on the street and needed earplugs to sleep.

"“It wasn't as bad as the reviews we had read!” After reading some horrible reviews we found ourselves pleasantly impressed. YES, it is small. Think of a small room, then think smaller. We had the standard queen room and pretty much all that was in the main room was a bed, tv and a small desk. Don't expect to do yoga in the room, but if all you're going to be doing is crashing there after a busy day in New York it will work just fine. The bathroom is miniscule. You can peak out the bathroom door while you're sitting on the toilet, but it worked, it was clean and I didn't care. The people are pretty nice at the hotel. It is loud - as far as hearing sirens and traffic, but it's New York people, what do you expect?
THE WORST THING about the hotel is the outrageous charge of $10 a day for internet access. Really? That is ridiculous and of course, I still paid it because i needed to get some work done. But I'm still bitter.

The lobby and corridors are really dark, the rooms are pretty small (although not absolutely ridiculous as some people have said) and the service, although on the face of it is ok, is actually awful. There isn't even a sign on the front of the hotel - we had to guess where it was. It has more of a feel of a seedy club rather than a hotel. The room was comfortable and clean, but was quite small, had no bath tub, and the air conditioning was really loud. There was also quite a lot of noise from the streets (although this wasn't too bad). The staff appeared friendly and helpful but whenever you actually wanted anything done they couldn't have been less helpful. Possibly the worst thing of all is the wait to see someone at reception - massive lines are commonplace, and once my wife waited almost an hour to see someone!

"“Small rooms, noisy and lack of staff, but great for Central Park” I was very excited about staying in the Hudson as I had the impression that i was a chic hotel. However on arrival on a Friday evening, there was terrible tacky music coming from the bars and club. It was very noisy as we waited in the long queue for check-in and when we took our 7th floor room, we realised that all the music was funnelling up from the internal courtyard and it was very difficult to relax especially with the rooms being so small. The hotel was unable to move us to a quieter room even though I had requested a quiet room in the booking. We were offered a room change the following day, but we had too much baggage to want to move. 
The hotel had a serious lack of staff the weekend that we were there. At times there was only 1 person at the front desk and several people waiting to check-in. There was also no one at the concierge desk. We called from our room with a request for the concierge but we just got the voicemail and finally we had to come down ourselves to the desk. There was still no concierge available and we had to queue at the front desk for assistance. The hotel needs to resolve its staffing issues. 
Another negative point about the hotel is that the wireless internet is not free. Surely modern hotels should know by now that customers expect free wifi. I find it surprising that it's often the most expensive hotels that charge for the basic service of wifi. 
The greatest positive about the Hudson is the location. It's just a short walk from Central Park which is great in the summer and perfect if you want to go for a run around the park or just walk around soaking up the atmosphere.",PurdeyHJ,2011-06-01,223023,2011-06-06,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Less than impressed” My wife and I stayed at this hotel over the weekend, as we were attending a wedding that was taking place in the hotel.
Our experience started off very poorly - we arrived at 3pm, the stated check in time, and were told that our room was not ready (and if this was a 15 minute wait I'd not complain, but we had to wait over an hour). It was not just us, most of the guests in the lobby were being told the same thing, with the excuse being that ""the hotel was full last night"". Ummmm, aren't hotels supposed to be able to plan for that eventuality and staff accordingly? I've checked into sold out hotels many times and never had to wait for my room for this reason. And the front desk staff were very rude about this, and in general - during our visit my room key stopped working and I went down to the front desk to have the issue corrected, and was told by the clerk that I was mistaken as to which room I was staying in and that's why the card wasn't working (turned out I was right and she was just an idiot).
The hotel works hard at being hip and modern, and I think they cater to that crowd. I noticed a lot of the other guests were european tourists (with the accompanying hygiene and personal space issues). There isn't even a sign out front letting you know where it is, kind of an ""if you don't know we are here, we don't want you here"" kind of thing, very funny and very New York hipster. 
Now, onto the room - we paid $250 per night for the privilege of staying in a closet big enough to hold a bed and a bathroom. Now, I get that this is NYC so prices will be up there. Also, if they are catering to the tourist crowd, it makes sense to have small rooms since they will mostly be using the rooms just to sleep and get cleaned up (or not, see the ""european tourist"" part). So, if you are looking for a place in the city that provides a room you can relax in, don't stay here. If you like effective air conditioning in your room, don't stay here. If you are looking to avoid be condescended to by the front desk staff for daring to ask that your room be ready at check in time, or your key stops working, and would like to avoid treated like you should be grateful for being granted the privilege of spending your money in the hotel, don't stay here.

“Great bar and Restaurant” Was staying at the Hudson for two nights last April.

"“Just Visit the Bar do not Stay” I expected small rooms considering the price and location this is what I got . However the poor service and not my fault attitude from the staff is not reflected in the price tag.
The hotel looks great however after a long wait to check in , an exploding hair dryer and no wine in the bar ..the list goes on. The cost saving was simply not worth it. 
 As for bringing the issues to the managers attention he blamed it all on the rain !
He offered a breakfast which when we arrived at the restaurant the next morning we were informed the restaurant was closed for a private function.

"“Don't think you're different to those who didn't like this hotel, it's awful” My husband and I ignored the reviews and desperately regret it. We figured that we're young and cool and live in London so this sort of place would be fine for us.
The public areas are lovely. The rooms are small but they're fine. However, there's no quiet public area, only lots of loud music and loud people and the rooms are so noisy it is beyond a joke. It's like being in a nightclub. My husband had some really important unexpected work to do and it's just impossible to do anywhere.
But the really serious issue is the amount they pre-authorised on our card. Hundreds and hundreds of dollars more than the room and tax, including a second transaction on day 2 of our stay which they had no right to take, which seriously impeded our ability to have fun in New York. And the staff whenever we needed anything whether it was help with lost property, demands to get our money reimbursed or just a coffee were mostly rude, unhelpful and at one point practically lied and treated us with no respect.

"“Worst stay of my life! AVOID IT...” Singular worst stay of my life, and I have had some bad experiences. Not only was experience terrible they still have a pending charge on my credit card from when the room was booked 3 weeks ago. I paid for my stay in full on the 21st when I left. This was a very nice touch in addition the the stuff below.
Here is what I wrote to the hotel when they asked about my experience (shocker they haven't responded):
To whom it may concern,
I have stayed in your hotels over 15 times for various work and personal trips and this was the first horrendous experience. I am not sure if this was a reflection of the hotel or the company but it was not enjoyable. To begin, I booked my hotel over the phone, and made it clear 3 times that I did not want a smoking room as I do not smoke. I also had to call back twice to re-register my room as I would not be arriving until 2 pm because of work, even though I said I would be coming and paid for the room (it should be held for me). When we arrived at 2 am after a lot of traveling, I was shown to my room. The room was a smoking room (see above). I called the front desk to explain the mistake and he said they had no other rooms (pushy with this). I would not take this answer, so after 15 minutes of arguing he finally found another room . The next room, not sure if this was better or worse was the singular loudest place I have ever stayed. The room was located on the 6th floor (643) and was directly outside from the ventilation shaft, I am not exaggerating when I say it sounded like we were sleeping in a helicopter. I woke up with a massive headache and did not sleep much that night due to the noise. The headache and sleep deprivation greatly affected my meetings the next day. When I woke up in the morning I tried to use the phone to get breakfast/ switch rooms, but it didn’t work? After that I gave up on what seemed like futile effort and spent as little time as possible in your hotel. Luckily for the front desk they did not bother to ask me how my stay was.

"“Amazing hotel, very trendy” I planned our trip as a suprise for my fiance for his birthday (and joint engagment present). I have always wanted to stay at The Hudson, from seeing The Sanderson in London, another of Ian Schrager's hotels.
Once booked, I checked the reviews on here and was a little nervous about all the negative comments about room sizes and as I wanted our trip to be perfect I emailed the manager Fady in advance of our trip. As I hadn't had a reply to my email, I wasn't expecting to be upgraded on arrival, but thats exactly what happened. Fady greeted us personally and upgraded us to a larger room, which was lovely. It was a great size for New York, and the hotel itself is in a great location close to central park, and its bar/club is one of the citys hotspots for nightlife (outside the meatpacking district).
The staff at the hotel were amazing, and we used the concierge service extensively, from recommending and booking restaurants for us (getting us great tables at very short notice in some of NYC's hippest venues) nothing was too much trouble. We booked our bus tour tickets through them and they recommended a great venue for sunday brunch, breakfast and even sorted our boarding passes when the sad time came that we had to leave.
The skylounge and other bars were amazing and overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.

"“Airplane bathrooms have more room than the bathrooms at this hotel. Seriously.” My man surprised me with a trip to New York and told me that he had booked this hotel before we left. He wanted to make sure that I would be happy with it - he liked what he saw on the hotel's website and admittedly at first, so did I. However, after reading the many posts on TripAdvisor, I learned the reality of exactly what to expect of the hotel but I didn't ask him to change the reservation, which ended up being a mistake. My worst fears were realized upon check-in despite the effort of emailing the hotel manager before we left (fady.awad@morganshotelgroup.com) who had replied to some of the TripAdvisor posts advising people to contact him prior to their arrival to make arrangements for an appropriately sized room. I never heard back from him so we did end up getting stuck with a room that was the smallest I've ever seen, with a bathroom that my 6'3"" man couldn't even turn around in. He ended up having to use the facilities down on the main floor for all 5 days we were there because he simply could not fit into the bathroom. The only redeeming quality about the room was that it was clean. They didn't have any other rooms available except for a smoking room, which I won't stay in because of the smell.
Another undesirable part of the hotel is the constant loud music and partying taking place in the bar, lobby, elevators, even outside in front of the hotel. If I was in my early 20s, sure, it probably would be fun. But I'm not, so it wasn't. Their website shows a tranquil looking ""Private Park"" located outside the lobby... in reality it's loud, crowded and very dark. 
The staff was rude for the most part, except for one helpful guy at the concierge desk. And after spending $80 on 4 drinks (yes, FOUR drinks cost EIGHTY dollars with tip) in the Library, we would expect to be able to relax and enjoy them rather than being told shortly after that they were closing and rudely being asked to finish up and leave. Seriously. It was rather unbelievable and beyond disappointing.
So in short, don't bother contacting the hotel manager before you go because based on my experience, it's an exercise in futility, and don't go by what their website shows or you'll be very disappointed. There are plenty of other hotels with bigger rooms and better service, in locations that are just as good.

“Awful” Escalator didn't work. Elevators packed. Dark corridors with matchsticks preventing the fire hose box from opening. Doors obviously mended after being in kicked in. Tiny room. Tiny bathroom.

"“Hudson, not so groovy!” So, this is how it was. The first room we had was 1257, and after a flight from the UK we were looking forward to catching up on some sleep. However, though the room window was obviously closed, it might as well been open, as the noise from the street was unbearable. We got through the night to the sound of constant traffic and sirens (which are the sounds you expect, just not so amplified whilst trying to sleep!). In the morning, after inspecting the window we found that it was not sealed properly. We moved rooms but that obviously meant packing all our stuff etc and going to 1627, that process lost us a couple of hours.
The second room seemed fine, no issues on the noise. But the air con was not working. Called the front desk and said we were going out, but they said they would have it sorted when we got back. All that was sorted when we got back was that our room keys weren't working! So complained about the air con again and someone from engineering arrived, flicked a switch outside apparently and bingo, it was working. Went out that night, came back, no air con! Called front desk, said they would send someone up but no one came, slept okay, but a bit hot and humid. So the next morning complained to front desk abot this and he said ""will get it sorted"", I said, ""heard that beore"" and he said, ""it wont be my fault if it isnt, cant speak for other staff or engineering dept."" Blameless Bob! Anyway, cut a long story short, this went on for 2 days, we gave up ringing, crap!
The quoes at reception are not fun either. And the shower was half hanging off!
Overall, it seems to be the place to be seen, just not such a great 'actual' hotel/",nick186299,2011-05-01,223023,2011-05-18,False,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Disappointing...” I am a frequent traveller, and stay in many different hotels in major cities around the world. I can't beleive this hotel is Morgan (doing damage to your brand). 
My summary: A thin, hip veneer on top of a shabby run down hotel.
Dirty....hallways not vacuumed, mould in bathrooms
Poorly maintained....tv not reliable, A/C noisy. Walls dinged, and not recently painted. Shabby. 
Sleep.....Not good. Bed lumpy...can't beleive I actually had a spring sticking into my back. Outside noise + A/C noise. Ouch.
Service spotty...except the concierge, and curb-side help. Easy to get a cab, very efficient and on it. The one positive point.
Crowded...always lines at reception, very difficult to get attention
Noisy....make sure you get a room facing onto the courtyard!!! Even then, bring your ear-plugs. They really need double glazing. We changed rooms due to the noise, and beleive me I don't do this often!
Can I get a drink or something to eat?....they closed the one good bar for a private event the evening we came back to the hotel after a long day, looking for a cold beer. The roof-top bar? A joke. Both times I stopped by for a cocktail, they were closed ""due to weather""
I come to NY often, and will never stay here again (this is my 3rd stay here). PLEASE Go to the Ace, Standard or W instead.

"“Good value, good NY location” Arrived at hotel 8pm long check in line, probably 20 min wait. Looks like all rooms weren't ready and had to check what was available.
Saw reviews prior and expected small room- yes is small but clean and great bath products.
Restaurant is great I ate there several times- it's buffet but dishes are cooked fresh in single serves.

"“Massively over-rated - AVOID!” Well, despite a lot of mixed (and negative) reviews of the Hudson, I thought I'd see for myself what the hotel was like. Having stayed in other NYC hotels over the last 10-15yrs, I was aware that New York hotel rooms are (on the whole) small and very pricey. However, given that the Hudson is part of the Morgans Group - the same group that own the Sanderson and St Martin's Lane in London - I had good expectations.
Sadly, the expectations didn't last long. I arrived and had to wait almost 20 minutes to check-in. Given there are over 800 rooms in this hotel (yes, you read that correctly), the fact they only had 2 staff working on the front desk is just ridiculous. Clearly this is an issue as this complaint comes up time and time again, so you would think the management would read the feedback and employ more staff - clearly not.
Room was bearable, but only because we upgraded to a junior suite, which was passable in size. That said, it's the smallest suite I've ever stayed in!! I know others who stayed in the regular rooms, and they are TINY! If there are over 800 rooms, the hotel should knock some rooms together and give people more space.
In terms of the amenities in the room, the storage space was minimal - one rail, and a storage stack unit with 4 compartments. Hardly adequate for a suite with two occupants. Also a mini-bar, but no fridge........HUH?? No tea/coffee facilities either - for a hotel of this standard, that is rubbish! Maintenance of the room was poor - the light stand didn't work, some of the wood panelling was coming away, and the cleanliness of the room was poor also- LOTS of dust. Bathroom was small also, with a tiny bath/shower. Putting a shelf unit over the WC basin is NOT a good idea, especially when things fall off - clearly the designer of this layout didn't consider this.
The hallways of the hotel are very dark, poorly maintained/decorated and look in serious need of a refresh. The lobby and entrance are made to look glamorous and certainly have a bit of the ""WOW"" factor, but once you're past the Reception area, it's all downhill.
I avoided the restaurant - $29 for a breakfast isn't exactly my idea of value - and the club on the lobby floor level turns the venue into a nightclub at weekends. Great if that's what you're after - not so great if you want something a bit more refined and stylish.
Staff in the hotel - cleaners didn't do all the tasks I would expect daily (empty the bin, replenish tissues, etc), so that was poor. Reception staff were slow and unhelpful. Concierge was the only highlight - decent service, and knowledgable. Maintenance/engineering staff were useless - totally incompetent, and unable to fix issues with the poor TV signal. 
Not much I can say in the way of positives I'm afraid. OK, it's cheap, but so is the Best Western in Midtown, so go there instead - at least the rooms are marginally bigger.",kobebryantLDN,2011-04-01,223023,2011-05-04,False,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Never, ever, again!!!!!!!!” I realize that all NYC rooms are going to be ""cozy"", but nothing could have prepared me for this room. It is actually smaller than the smallest cabin on any cruise ship. The bathroom was so tiny that getting ready to go out was frustrating. Sleeping accommodations were as bad....a very uncomfortable queen size bed with a ridiculous wall mounted t.v. on the side of the bed. Also, the acoustics were a real challenge as sleeping was nearly impossible due to the doors slamming in the halls, the traffic (heard on the 10 floor) which I am sure is due to a vent behind the bed which must open to the outside directly. I admit the lobby and bar were visually attractive but do NOT be fooled by this as the dingy hallways and shoe box size rooms will make you miserable. We travel often but have never been so uncomfortable in what one would expect (as seen on their website) to be a high end hotel.

"“didn't have a room for us after we confirmed the booking” We were running late doing touristy things in NYC I called them about 3 times to ensure that it's ok to check in about 11pm ... they told us not to worry and that the reception is open all night and that our room will be held ... BUT when we got there, apparently they gave the room away to someone else! 
OMG being tourists and so tired we were apalled. They made us wait in reception until about 1am they offered us drinks but all we really wanted to do was go to sleep. At about 1.15 they ""Found"" a room lol it's more like a box than a room ... you had to dive into it as it was too close to the wall and I guess it was made for very skinny people ...

"“Cheap and Clean But Really Really Small” I traveled to New York with my grown daughter and we booked this room through Priceline. At $135 per night it was quite a bargain for New York. My minimum standard for a hotel room is that it be clean. I have no complaints there. The room was spotless. However, I have never experienced such a small room in all my travels. There was literally just enough room around the queen size bed to stand up. The TV is hung on the wall and my daughter kept hitting her head on the TV when she stood up out of bed. The closet is ok but the bathroom is basically 3 feet by 6 feet, including the shower, toilet and sink area. A very large person would have trouble maneuvering in there. Sometimes I could hear dripping water at night which was annoying but the bed was comfortable enough. The main desk area is dark but nice with an arched roof and ivy growing up and across. Once you go up to the rooms the halls are dark gray and the carpet is in bad need of replacing. The rooms are hardwood floors so they are easier to keep clean. If all you're looking for is a clean room in a decent location at a cheap price then this is the place.

"“Enjoyable experience at Hudson but reviews are pretty accurate” Traveling with a friend for a weekend in NYC. Having never been to NY, I wasn't sure what location would be best. After looking at tons of hotels, reviews and prices, I booked this hotel via Priceline. I became very leery after reading all of the bad reviews, but I have to say, upon arriving, that I was pleasantly surprised. This hotel is very close to Central Park and easily walkable to Times Square. There's a great cafe right around the corner where we had delicious croissants and coffee. Granted, most of the reviews are based in truth but you have to take everything with a grain of salt. Yes, the hotel lobby and hallways are very dark, but you can see the numbers in the elevator. The hallways could definitely use a renovation - carpet is old and stained and looks dingy. We found the hotel staff and the doormen to be very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. We asked for a later check out and had no problems whatsoever. The guests did appear to be mostly european and younger and there is a nightclub with very loud music, but we were on the 12th floor, so it didn't affect us. I would definitely have been upset if our room were closer to the club noise. The room is indeed tiny, but we managed just fine. I read some postings about the window from the bathroom to the room - there's another curtain you can close and it blocks your view and gives the person complete privacy. We had no issue with that at all. We had a closet to hang our clothes, but no drawers. For our needs, it was fine. I wouldn't want to stay in the room for a long period of time; it's very small. Applying makeup was a little difficult outside of the bathroom (I agree the hairdryer was fabulous -best one I've used!)
For us, the bottom line is - we came to NY to see the city, not to sit in our hotel room. The hotel is in a great location, the garden area/bar was beautiful to sit in and have a drink, the staff was very friendly.

"“Ok - Indifferent was my experience” Stayed here for 7 nights in room 2302. Read lots of reviews online about this hotel and generally the reviews were ""its ok"" and this was very much my experience.
We arrived at around lunchtime, check in was painless and pretty quick and we were welcomed with a smile.
The reception area is a bit dark but it goes with the whole atmosphere of the place. We got into our room on the 23rd floor (highly recommend getting as high as possible to ensure you manage to get some sleep). We got into the room and on the face of it seemed clean and good. The bed was made nicely and was well equipped with TV, small desk and air conditioning. Problem with the AC is that it was rather loud, if it was summer I wouldnt want to try and sleep as it was that loud!
On further inspection of the room there was quite a bit of dust under the bed, also on the desk chair and it could of done with some tidying up of cables and general freshening up. As we were on the 23rd floor no window to open and it did smell a bit musty when we first got into the room. Downside of the room is that there is no wardrobe, there is a rail to hang things but having no door on it seems to me to be an oversight.
The shower room was not great, again on the face of it the seemed clean but on further inspection the grout on the tile floor in the shower area was cracked and the last time they used sealant on the joins it was done belry messily and wasnt to the standard I would expect of any hotel.
The biggest problem was fruit flies or bar flies that were in the shower area. No more than half a dozen, we told the guys at reception and housekeeping was sent up. The next day the flies were back and I killed a couple every morning. I guess they came from the drains. When we checked out they did wipe of some charges for internet and phone calls which they didnt have to do so that was a plus. 
The location was great, 15 mins walk to Times Sq, 5 mins walk to Central Park and a subway station (Columbus Circle) 5 mins from the hotel as well so you are no more than 30 mins from Financial District. Also for the locations and price it was one of the cheapest in the area.
Overall as I didnt spend all that much time in the Hotel the stay was fine, but no better than that. The room was on the small side but the bed was comfortable. We were there to see the sites and we did loads of walking, by the time we got back to the hotel we were too tired to check out the bar so if you are looking for a hotel with a cool bar next door this might be the place.

"“Just a step away from personable, but service what should be expected.” Our stay at the Hudson was on recommendation. We were not disappointed however we weren't overly impressed. 
The room was clean and the beds comfortable. The room wasn't quiet, the noise from the street everpresent. We turned the air con on at night, the white noise effect, but the unit groaned and rattled. We were charged for our internet which cut out continually. We called to complain but no followup inquiries ensued. When we checked out we where told we could have moved to another room for better reception but that solution was not offered by the tech staff when we made the initial complaint. It might have been an issue if one needed to conduct uninterupted online business during their stay.
Not impressed with the state of the hallways on our floor. Dirty rug and scraped walls. There were cracks in the caulking and some major battering had occured around our door.
The lobby and elevators were dark, the light levels day and night could only be classified as moody. Must have been on purpose, some sort of trendy signature effect.
Cocktails were expensive on the terrace. The patrons were all definetly hip and cosmopolitan, so maybe it was just us.

"“Style over substance!” Based on the fact that it was designed in part by Phillipe Stark I had high hopes for the hotel. Upon arrival you realise how dark the hotel is however you initially forgive it as it is undeniably stylish. At check in we arrived early (pre 3pm)and did the paperwork and checked in our bags leaving us time to explore NY whilst we waited for our room to be ready.
When we arrived back to collect the key we had a small wait as reception was busy but we got the key and peceded to our room to meet our luggage, one of the many bug bears I had with the hotel was the amount of time I seemed to spend waiting for the lifts to arrive whether we were going up or down we seemed to spend a great deal of time waiting and trying to anticipate the lift that would arrive to prevent the inevitable scrum for the lift as by the time it had arrived there was a crowd of people waiting.
The trip to the room is through dark and dimly lit corridors that have no natural light to them, with the grey decor and grey carpets its quite depressing.
The room is incredibly compact and again very dark due to dark wood flooring & panelling, there is little to no natural light (despite haviing a window they have somehow managed to build a hotel that supresses natural light!) so felt like the evening all the time, the lighting whilst looking stylish is impractical (no central ceiling light!!), you cannot do anything in the main area of the bedroom (which when I talk about the bathrooom you'll understand why it is so annoying) due to it being so dark which in our room was compounded by the fact that the desk lamp didn't work.
The bathroom is frankly ridiculous, it is so small that it is borderline impractical. You have a shower that has a shower curtain on each side which sticks to you as you shower, you step out onto the toilet area and have limited space to towel dry without running the risk of breaking your neck, If you are 5ft 11 then your knees touch the wall when you are sitting on the loo and with the sink on your right if your right handed then good luck when it comes to wiping, our toilet had a cracked bowl as all the storage shelves are above it (quick tip put down the the toilet lid - I nearly lost my deodrant when it fell off the shelf!!) & something has clearly fell off the shelve and into the toilet causing the damage.
The sound proofing is poor and you can here next door clearly (suspect that is due to the fact the rooms are so small), ended up whispering for the most part, the doors slam shut and when a neighbour comes in you honestly think someone is trying to gain entry to your room.
We ate in the hall of the hotel (tapas style where you help yourself), we arrived at 9pm with last orders at 10.25pm, of the 20 or so dishes that you should be able to self select there must have been 7 or 8 available, at no point did the 3 or 4 chefs who are behind an open counter cook even one of the dishes (all in all hugely disappointing), the courtyard was unavailable for 3 of the 5 days to to roof work being undertaken (shame as the weather was so good), the bar that the guide books rave about didn't even open during the 4 night duration of our stay (we were pushed towards the hall or the library), due to the bar being closed the library was full we ended up having to sit in reception with our cocktails - limited list and not very good to boot but expensive.
The staff were pleasant throughout but the location isnt the best if you want nightlife and restaurants - would recommend Soho or Tribeca as apposed to Midtown West.
As this is my first stay in NY I cannot comment on it versus other hotels in the Manhatten area but what I can say is that I won't be back there.",soundbites30,2011-04-01,223023,2011-04-28,False,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Don't stay here, this place is a seedy dump!” This isn't somewhere you want to arrive when you've just got off an 8 hour flight. When I saw where the taxi was going I thought it couldn't possibly be the right hotel, but it was. The entrance area was like a ghetto. The lobby's OK in the daylight but at night you can't see where you're going. The majority of the staff were friendly but check-in/check-out took forever because they were so slow. My daughter felt intimidated by the way one of the male staff was leering at her when she was alone.
I knew people had said the rooms were small - but nothing had prepared me for the fact that they were TINY. You can't move in there. The bathroom was ridiculous. Neither of us are tall or overweight and we couldn't move in there. Please do believe the people who say you won't be able to use the bathroom - it's not an exaggeration. Perhaps that's why the toilets in the lobby are so well used, because it's almost impossible to use the one in the bathroom. The shower was so dirty we were reluctant to use it.
The only good thing was that the sheets were clean. The rest of the room was dirty and battered. It was all very seedy and everywhere was badly lit. The area outside wasn't nice, I was worried about walking back at night. The corridors were smelly and like a ghetto. Even though there were several lifts, they were all very slow and seemed to have minds of their own. The walls were so thin you could hear everything.

The only place to store clothing such as underwear was a 12in x 12in tower (5 shelves), open to the front at the front entrance so that anyone entering the room would first see your private belongings. There was not a single light adequate for reading, not even in the bathroom which did not have enough light to see one’s face for shaving or make up. 
The room we were assigned was at 85 degrees, and when I called to ask that they fix it, they said they would but never came up. I finally went to the desk and asked for a different room. The desk clerk was rude, and when I stood my ground asking to see the manager was told the manager was busy – she finally came and gave us a better room (only because we had a wheel chair which clearly could not fit into our room!!).
On returning to our room I could not enter it because the key would not work. A security guard came to open the door and said he would fix it within half an hour. We left the room for a day of sightseeing but when we returned the door had not been fixed and again we had to wait for a security person to open the door. After this person “reprogrammed” the door lock, rather than seeing to it that we would get new keys, I was asked to go to the desk to get these keys. I did so, only to find that there were only two desk clerks to handle some 12 patrons, which meant waiting 10 minutes.
Oh yes, and on arrival, the door personnel were asked to bring up our luggage. They lost one of the bags, finding it only after about 30 minutes.
As in some other hotels, WiFi access was not free. However, this was the first hotel we had been to in many years in which there was no free WiFi or internet access in or near the lobby for printing out a boarding pass. 
This is not to say that all was bad: The concierge was helpful, the cleaning staff and security people were extremely courteous, and the location was ideal. The room was immaculately clean.
What seems obvious was that this hotel was meant for young kids traveling only with a knapsack, who preferred loud (very loud) rock music in the lobby and elevator and preferred nouveau décor to functional facilities.
As I said, Motel 6 would have been preferable and certainly less expensive.",rauerbac,2011-04-01,223023,2011-04-23,False,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hotel aimed at weathly, trendy, young party-goers.” There are so many pro's and con's for this hotel.
Pro's - The location is great, being so close to broadway, cental park and the subway. 
Our room was very clean, a fair size for a NY city hotel room and was cleaned with no problems everyday. We found the room cleaverly designed with good use of room for storage of items. 
This may sounds silly but the hair dryer in the room was very good! Unlike most hairdryers in hotel rooms it was powerful!
Con's - Expensive! The lobby was a bit odd because it was so dark, you could barely see where you were walking. 
Although there were about 6 lifts, it was always a long wait for one to arrive.
The room was very noisy because of the traffic, thankfully we had ear plugs to use because we needed them! Also there was no fridge or mini bar in the fridge, (being a diabetic, a fridge is always useful for safe insulin storage)
Overall, this hotel is great for who it's aimed at - weathly, trendy, young partyers. If that's not you then it's just a over-priced, dark but ok and well located hotel.",urbansoulpie,2011-04-01,223023,2011-04-23,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Too hip for us” Very relieved this was a husband's business expense. Great location near Columbus Circle, but you can not locate the hotel except for spotting bellman in the street out front hailing cabs. Relieved we had no car. A long, steep escalator up to the lobby. Many Euro guests. Extremely loud twenty-something atmosphere.
So dimly lit, I wondered what they were trying to hide...so dark in the elevator we could not see the buttons and hoped other guests would ask what floor we needed. I realize it was very rainy during our stay, but the hallways are so dark (lit only with art work type lights shining down over your guest room door number) you have to feel your way down the hall. I kept thinking someone was going to jump out from the dark around the next corner.
4 star room decor and lovely wood trimmed walls made to look like the interior of a classic ( 20's?) cruise steamship. Extremely small with no closet or dresser. We're still not sure how they got the standard bathtub in the bathroom? The dressing area with large mirror located outside the bathroom was the only place we could stand with out stumbling over one another and we had an upgraded room! No place to put your one piece of standard airline carry on luggage without falling over it. Hooks on the wall.
Great looking gourmet cafeteria style restaurant that I'm sorry we did not get to try. Lobby bar music so loud at night with the boom of the base, we tried to have a cocktail at the ""library"" bar. Music even louder in there!

"“Tiny, noisy, shaky room, cheap furniture, expensive food” nice decoration of public areas but tiny room with minimal, cheap furniture. staying at 2 floor above lobby where the club is - the music was so loud that the whole room was shaking due to the bass. and it went on whole night. extremely poor sound isolation. extremely limited choices of food was at four seasons pricing but of fast food quality. e.g. 10 dollars for cookies + surcharges.",y4k,2011-04-01,223023,2011-04-22,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“NYC Health Dept should investigate & most useless staff ever” Every bad review you've read about this hotel is true. I don't know what was wrong in my room but I could not breathe after spending 10 mins in it. I tried to call the front desk but that was totally useless. So I went down to the front desk and to my surprise there was another guest complaining of the same problem in his room. The only thing I can think is that beneath the aging contemporary exterior is utter filth and decay causing unhealthy air (mold, dirt, bugs, and who knows what else).
The manager on duty was so rude and his attitude so unacceptable it made my blood boil. However, after thinking about it I realized the manager isn't empowered to satisfy guests and he is just another working stiff having to listen to irate customers. The real problem is with the ownership and executives managing this hotel.

"“What a poor hotel assignment from Priceline” This hotel is so bad on so many levels I am not sure where to start. I admit, I am an old fogie. I am not a college age traveler. I have traveled the world and continue to do so. Stayed in lots of hotels, including NY. My wife and I were assigned this hotel by Priceline. It was my first experience using Priceline. It will be my last. I will recommend this hotel however to any college age kids wanting to party in the Big Apple.
 If you are over 25 and not falling in bed after a night at the club, or not a 22 year old college student tired from running through the halls banging doors, don't come here. Loud doors? Wow.
If you are expecting a bathroom that you can actually move around in, do not come here. But the soap is awesome. My wife brought it home. If you are expecting to be able to see the map you are trying to read for the days activities in the lobby, don't come here.
The room size? There is no size in these rooms. Silly small. But don't worry, when you check in they tell you it was a girls dorm or something 60 years ago so you should feel ok. 
This is my first review ever on a website. But, now I know why people write these things. I tried to get my money back from Priceline but nothing doing. Oh well.",eyelovetwotravel13,2011-04-01,223023,2011-04-18,False,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Terrible experience, very rude staff” Where to start......when trying to check in after an international long-haul flight, there I waited 25 minutes, was ignored by the woman at the desk, who left the desk without any explanation to the 6 people in the queue waiting to check in and didn't return for about 10 minutes. No other staff came to assist. There was no offer to help with our bags and we were given a room at the very end of the corridor (which was dirty with marks all over the walls and the carpet). The window in the room was broken and would not close properly. I had to ring the front desk three times before some one answered and sent a maintenance man up. He tried his best to fix the window but couldn't and a draft continued to come in through the window not to mentione the noise from the street which mean no sleeping pretty much. Luckily I had ear plugs from my flight however who wants to have to wear earplugs to sleep when staying at a hotel? There is absolutely no soundproofing whatsoever so if sleep is a prioirty, definitely stay elsewhere. There is also no concept of customer service at this hotel, for some reason, the front desk staff seem to think they have better things to do than be available for guests. The overall attitude was extremely obnoxious and as if they were doing us a favor by just answering the phone! The nightclub was really terrible and might have been an in crowd type place 5 years ago but was full of try-hards. The rooms are extremely tiny, even by NY standards and they are in need of an update (as well as the corridors). Go somewhere else!!!!!

"“Wow factor at entrance, but room far too tiny, uncomfortable and far too noisy” I went to that hotel during a one day business trip in New York.
First bad surprise at arrival, when the front desk lady (who was very nice and obviously trying to help so I would not blame her) explained to me that my room category was not available anymore. Instead of offering an upgrade (as most hotels would do almost systematically, especially for a first stay), I was given two options: complimentary breakfast or room discount. None of them being suitable to me (I was leaving in the following morning at 5:30 AM), I was offered a drink at the hotel bar. 
Having explained that I was looking for a quiet room, I was assigned room 975, which is stuck between two others. The room was exceptionally tiny, shabby and moderately clean. The window did not close properly, the heating system was incredibly noisy and the room door does not seal, so you can see the bit of light (there is not much though, the hotel is so dark!) from the corridor. 
Shower exceptionally tiny and uncomfortable too. 
In summary, a poor, overpriced hotel. Would never stay again.",Zenlam,2011-04-01,223023,2011-04-15,False,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
“Painful” I am amazed they can make a room this tiny. You are greeted on entering with painfully loud music. Service is for bar drinkers - not hotel guests. This is no place for rest.

"“Extremely Disappointing Experience” Flew in from London, arrived at the Hudson Hotel jet lagged at 10:00pm and tried to check in. They didn't seem to have any rooms available. We had called the Morgan Hotel Group directly and made our multiple night reservation with them. They could not find our reservation and even had the gall to question that we had even made one. I had to pull up their e-mail confirmation to prove it to them. They then left for a long period of time and came back with even more questions. They eventually called their Canadian call center and were finally able to confirm we had actually made a reservation. They then left again as they now needed to find a room. We had requested a quiet room on a high floor away from the elevators. Forty-five minutes after arriving, we were finally given a room right next to the staircase and the entrance to a patio with a lot of noise and foot traffic as people attempted to go outside. The patio was presumably closed due to winter even though it was April and the weather was beautiful outside.
The room was extremely small and the hotel is saving a lot of money on electricity since they don't seem to use any light bulbs, but that was not unexpected and we were okay with it. However, the room was very poorly maintained. The bathroom sink was cracked, the bathroom floor tiles were cracked, the bathroom shower had a coating on it which was peeling off, the television set did not work (their engineering department finally came to fix it on the third of our four day stay), the bed springs made a terrible noise every time we moved (our apologies go out to our neighbors since the rooms do not have any sound proofing at all). What can you do?
Given the challenges with our reservation, we should not have been shocked when a hotel employee knocked on our door at 6:00pm on our second day of our stay and asked us why we were still there. Our reservation was for three nights and four days. Thirty minutes later, another hotel employee showed up and did the exact same thing to us. Fifteen minutes after that our telephone rang and someone hung up after we answered it. We speculated it was a third hotel employee checking to see why we were still there. The next day both of our key cards stopped working and we had to go back to the reception desk to get them reprogrammed.
The library was closed since they were re-painting the ceiling all weekend. Their beautiful outside decks were still not opened for the Spring season. The escalator going up to the lobby was broken for at least 24 hours. Theoretically they could have allowed us to manually walk up to the lobby, but they blocked it off and the line at the elevators was extremely long. We attempted to print our boarding passes in the business center prior to our departure but did not want to pay the $7.00 it would have cost us to do that.
We paid $227 a night for the room including taxes which seemed reasonable enough. However, we expected more and would not go back.

"“Party hotel, not for sleeping” Impressive lobby (once you find the entrance, which is not hotel-like) and first look of the room is impressive (with see-through into the shower from the bed...), but the sleeping quality was pretty bad and the staff was not very helpful.

I called again and said that I was tired and would very much like it fixed. 20 mins later I called again, and finally the engineers came up and unplugged the lamp (from beneath the bed). No excuses for this taking so long.
The hotel has three restaurants (at least) and one of the outdoor ones play party music which is heard into all rooms.

"“Never again.....” Just arrived at this so called hip and happening hotel and to be frank, it's awful. 
The rooms are beyond small and with an arthritic mother, it's not an ideal situation to be in. Also we have been given a queen room, despite requesting a twin at booking over a month ago. 
The room itself is small, which having been to NYC before I fully expected, however, this from cannot fit two adults' suitcases without one of us falling over it. There's an ironing board, goodness knows where to put it up without being double jointed!
The bathroom is beyond a joke. Hardly any room whatsoever and it's filthy. Otter people's dirt which turned my not so sensitive stomach several times. 
The owners of this property have concentrated with putting mod-cons in the room such as stereo, HD TV ( which I walked into too many times to mention) iPod dock and a clock radio, however the essentials in my opinion are not here, eg tea/coffee facilities (brought a travel kettle, asked for cups and spoons only to be charged $5 for the privilege which is normally free in most hotels).

If you are looking for a traditional look and feel, then this is not the place for you. 
The rooms are tiny, but provided everything that we needed for our 3-day stay. This is not a room that will accommodate more that 2 people, and time in the bathroom can not be shared due to the limited space. Larger people may feel cramped in these rooms. I believe that they have larger rooms, but we didn't need anything more than we had for 2 people for 3 days. We had been advised to ask for a room on a higher floor, and on the 11th floor we had no problem with noise. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised that I never heard hallway noise, or even heard people in the rooms next to us. 
We splurged on a $17 martini and enjoyed the late night scene in the library bar. The atmosphere was great party scene and was very energizing for adults. For families traveling with kids, this hotel would not be where you, or your kids, would want to stay. It is definitely an adult atmosphere.
Our room phone didn't work and the tv remote didn't have numbers, but this was obviously unique to our room. Our friends on the same floor had a phone that worked and their tv remote not only had numbers, it had a lot more channels than ours!
The hotel is conveniently located close to Columbus Circle and the subway. The taxi drivers all seemed to know where The Hudson is located, so the lack of an outside sign wasn't a problem. Just know that you will not see any indication that this is a hotel (inside or outside), and just trust that you are in the right place.",SaltyGirl2,2011-04-01,223023,2011-04-04,False,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great Location near Central Park and subway.” We got our rooms on Priceline for a very good price. We had been warned in reviews that the rooms would be very small, and they were. But they were fine for sleeping. The queen bed was very comfortable. The shower was wonderful. The staff at the front desk were friendly and very helpful.",JNTravel35,2011-04-01,223023,2011-04-03,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Very hip hotel....10 years ago.” We stayed for seven nights and got very good value booking as a package via Virgin Holidays and feel that at the rate we paid was good, however if we'd paid the amount charged when booked seperately we wouldn't have been happy.
The rooms are way beyond small, there wasn't enough floor space next to the bed to lay a modestly sized suitcase flat, and scarcely enough storage to put both our cases out of the for the stay. The bathroom was adequate, but again tiny. But this is New York, you're not there to hang out in your hotel room. The worst thing about the hotel is just how gloomy the whole place is, we were meeting friends in the lobby every day and every day found ourselves peering into the dark trying to spot them. I know it's meant to be atmospheric, but having the whole place dimly lit 24 hrs a day is just rubbish, and in the case of the tatty corridors I suspect it's to hide just how tatty they are. Speaking of the corridors, the one our room was on absolutely reeked of weed! 
The whole place feels very dated, like it was cutting edge 10 years ago and they have since done nothing to it at all, which I believe is the case. The bar becomes a club in the evenings, full of people who seem to have come to try and spot the stars that apparently used to hang out there when it first opened.
All in all, if you get a cheap deal it's worth it, the staff are very helpful and friendly, the location is good and it's pretty clean, as far as you can see through the gloomy lighting!",Manofstraw,2011-02-01,223023,2011-04-02,False,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“It Suited Our Purposes” We have stayed at the Hudson twice for day trips into the New York to go to the Metropolitan Opera. We were looking for an affordable hotel near the opera for this trip. So in my mind the pluses were the location because we were able to walk to the opera, the parking garage is near by and the bakery on the corner is great for breakfast. I also like the Malin & Goetz toiletries in the bathroom. The downside of the hotel is that the rooms are small and dark but I think that is probably normal in NYC unless you pay a lot for your room. For some reason the hotel is always hot when we got into our room the heat was cranked to 80 degrees. It was a little too hot for my taste. The other thing I didn't like is that nothing is really marked, while I understand that it might be hip and cool it can be difficult to navigate the hotel unless given directions or reading the brochure in your room. However, for our second stay it wasn't an issue because we already learned where everything was. The lobby can be noisy at night but we never had trouble sleeping. The beds are OK. I have slept on worse but I have also slept on better. On our first stay the hotel held our bags for us after check out which was nice because we still wanted to spend some time in the city after check out.",MosaicofThoughts,2011-03-01,223023,2011-03-31,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Compact and not bijou” This is a strange hotel. It's pitch black in the lobby in the middle of the day - like walking in to a nightclub, which of course it is at night.
The corridors/halls felt like a student halls of residence and were as shabby. The bedroom was ok, but the shower room was tiny. There was less than one foot between the front of the toilet bowl and the wall. As there were wooden floors in the rooms, I could hear the person above me tapping around in heels - very annoying at 4am!

“Home away from Home” We stayed at the Hudson for 3 nights and had such a great time. The hotel is wonderful and the service is what I had imagined it would be...if not better!!!..we had a great room..fresh and clean. The bar is great..very lively and has a real local atmpsphere as there were people from all over New York there.

“Always a great place to stay” Had a great time as usual. I stayed in a great room and it was very quiet. The restaurant was great able to watch the NCAA tournament.

"“Good Location” I was in room 875. I couldn't open my door but the front desk sent someone up in less than 5 minutes. He was very friendly and helpful. The door knob was backward and had to be pushed up instead of down.
The only two free outlets were in the bathroom and neither worked. I didn't notify the front desk, I just unplugged the desk clock and light and used those outlets.
The noise outside was louder than I expected and there seemed to be some thumping music which I assumed was from the club downstairs.
The size of the room is very small but is fine for just one person. The bed is very low to the floor which was weird and not too comfortable. The room was very clean.
The entrance to the hotel is obscure and I walked past it on more than one occasion. The lobby is really trendy and and nice looking. The outside patios look like they would be a nice place to hang out in the summer. 
The location was fantastic. It's across the street from the Time-Warner building and the Shops at Columbus Circle. It's close enough Lincoln Center and not too far of a walk to Times Square.

"“This Hotel Gives Both an Escape and Provides Energy” The rooms, bed and service offer a wonderful escape at the end of the day and also an escape from the buzz of New York. And on the flip side, a visit to the lobby, bar, etc. are a dose of energy that are New York at its best.

"“Never, EVER stay at this hotel” The Hudson Hotel was horrible. Not one thing went right during our stay. The air conditioner was broken in our room and the room was stuck at 83 degrees when we arrived at 8:45pm. The hotel engineer took 45 minutes to come up to respond, but then did nothing but say ""it takes time."" The room was still at 79 degrees when we woke up in the morning. The lamp next to the bed was broken. The ironing board was broken, when they brought a replacement it was about two feet long and one inch off the ground. Not exactly useful to iron my silk dress for the wedding we were in town to attend. The shower was incredibly narrow, and they have those super cheap shower curtains that aren't heavy enough to hang flat and instead blow against you and constantly stick to your skin while you are showering. And if all this wasn't bad enough, the room is clautrophobically small. About one foot all around the edge of the bed. I get that New York standards are different, but I have been to NYC dozens of times, and for over $200 a night, you can get far better, nicer, and bigger rooms.",Barbara60713,2011-03-01,223023,2011-03-28,False,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“A unique and unforgettable hotel” You’ll find plenty of plain hotels (in New York and in the rest of world), which are decent places to stay, but nothing particular and nothing to remember. Hudson Hotel is not this kind of hotel. It’s an unique and unforgettable experience, which you should consider giving yourself when visiting New York. Yes, the rooms are pretty small and the prices are pretty high (look out for good rates at hudsonhotel.com). But apart from that, every detail - from the escalators to the bathroom sink - is so cool and trendy. We stayed 10 nights at Hudson Hotel in May 2010. After the first night (in a room directly above the noisy Private Park courtyard), we asked for room with a better view and without problems, we got a room on the 23rd floor instead. From this room we had a fantastic view towards the Hudson River, and it was a great place to stay - despite the lack of space (which wasn’t a problem as the interior was very well organised). The hotel has a great location, friendly staff and some really cool features such as Private Park, Sky Terrace and Hudson Bar. Especially Private Park is a really cool spot to have a drink (just a pity that the prices are so high). All in all, if you want an extraordinary and excellent hotel in New York, then Hudson Hotel is the place to stay.",morregard,2010-05-01,223023,2011-03-28,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
“No heat/ no hot water/no food/no hot beverage” We arrived at the hotel a hour before check-in and the lobby was freezing cold. We were told there was no heat nor hot water until 3:00pm. We then Inquired about lunch/snack/hot beverage and were told none of these were available until 5:00pm. How is that possible? Only cold beverages are served in the library.

The dissapointment came when even the guy at the check in desk said their rooms are even small in NY terms. I knew this was going to be bad.

"“I was worried after reading reviews but it was a good experience.” I read a few reviews saying the rooms were small and that people had other issues, but I had a positive experience overall. I booked the room through priceline (naming my price of $190 a night, which worked out to about $220 after all taxes and fees and for memorial day weekend, I thought that was a pretty good price).
The room was a little small but it's New York and that's what I would expect. We didn't spend much time in the room though (it was a beautiful weekend and obviously wanted to get out and see the city). The room was also modern and clean. And you can't beat the location- right off Colombus Circle and close to subway and central park.
The staff was nice and check in/out was a breeze. The garden bar was nice but prices were pretty high (gin and tonic and a Makers Mark were $31 for the two). We stayed on 10th floor and had no problem sleeping- couldn't even hear the noise from the club in the lobby.

"“Never in my life I´ll go back to Hudson Hotel” I got there at 5 am and they have sold my room to someone else, eventhough I had a guaranteed late check in by the travel agency and also my client, who got to the hotel early at night (8pm) told the clerk that I would be coming late (later found out that the person at front desk forgot to include that warning on the system).
The person that they had in fornt desk was a college boy with no authority or interest to find a solution. He even made me fill in the forms and hand my credit card before he told me that they had no rooms available.
After that he called his Supervisor, a very arrogant and rude guy that had only one answer: I can´t help you because you didn´t tell us in advance that you were coming in late. So according to hotel policies we sold your room to someone else and we are charging you no show fee.
Also, he said that they had no business with the travel agency (it was not their problem) and I should go and complain to them. 
It was only after one hour of screaming and waiting that he gave me a room, but that damage was already done: I had a meeting at 8:30 am and lots my precious time of rest arguing with a couple of rude, incompetent and useless clerks.
So next time you are amused by this trendy hotel, do not fall for the fancy hotel lobby or the modern restaurant.

"“Rooms not ready on time” We stayed here on two separate occasions in October 2010. Both times at check in we were advised our room wasn't ready (this was after check in time). Reception couldn't commit to a time by when it would be. Both times the wait was in excess of an hour and we were irritated the first time, furious the second time. There appears to be some serious managerial incompetence going on at this hotel. We demanded a discount when it happened on the second time which to their credit the hotel provided. Had we not complained so strongly we would easily have been kept waiting for 2 or more hours which is what happened to other people who attempted to check in around the time we did. But for this problem I would have been prepared to recommend this hotel. 
Our room was very quiet and the bed was exceptionally comfortable with good linen. We slept well. 
Rooms are indeed exceptionally small, so it's hard to feel like you're getting value for money here, but that's the norm in Manhattan. For tall people the toilet is so close to the wall that your knees collide with it when sitting down. However the design throughout compensated in my opinion. It's at the edge and although I didn't agree with every elements of it I did appreciate it all. The reception, first floor bar and skybar are all very well executed and I would recommend the latter with its lighting and hammocks particularly.",Dirk_London,2010-11-01,223023,2011-03-24,False,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Not bad...” We visited New York for the first time recently as our friends were getting married in Central Park...it was the last stop on a hectic 4 week holiday in the States and we were pretty exhausted by the time we got to NYC which probably has a bearing on how we found our stay...
The foyer to the hotel is, as many have said before, more like a fancy nightclub than a hotel...the staff are all gorgeous and the whole vibe is 'trendy'. The outdoor spaces were beautiful and the sky terrace was a great escape from the city that never sleeps - the huge hammock was a godsend after one particularly busy day haha! The only complaint I have about the sky terrace is the absolutely extortionate price of drinks - we visited other wedding guests at several other hotels in NYC during our stay and never encountered such ridiculous bar prices anywhere else! We would have spent alot more time here if it hadn't been for that!
We knew the room was going to be miniscule so no surprises there (in fact, our expectations were so low we were actually pleasantly surprised by the room!). We only slept there anyway so really cant see why so many people have such a huge problem with the rooms.
Overall, this hotel offered everything we needed in New York and was near to Central Park which had been our only ask... would we stay here again? probably not...in a city with so many accomodation choices, i'm pretty sure we could find better for the same price.

The rooms had a more European feel, which was a relief from typical American chains. I slept comfortably and heard no sounds from the hallway or neighboring rooms.

"“Beautiful lobby under a horrible hotel...” I had the misfortune to stay at the Hudson. At first, i was impressed with how beautiful/trendy it is, amazed with the friendly staff and i didn't even mind to wait in a long line to check in. 
I knew in advance that rooms at the Hudson were tiny, which for me was acceptable. What was unnaceptable about that room was a malfunctioning air conditioner (which couldn't make the temperature drop below 73F) and the very unconfortable bed, with a dirty old conforter.
After a stop at the frontdesk that ended up in apologies, free drinks at the bar and a promise that the AC would be fixed, no work was done (from what i've been reading, unkept promises are fairly common at the Hudson). 
However, the worst was just about to happen. When I lifted the griddle that hides the AC to see what was happening there, I found the most disgusting/unsanitary AC ever, full of dust, hair, no filter, like it has not been serviced in years. No wonder it doesn't work.
In resume, this is a beatiful Hotel that will suit you well if you like to sleep in a sauna and have no respiratory allergies. Or maybe if you want to impress your friends at the lobby. The rooms there have nothing in common with the luxurious/trendy common areas nor with the friendly staff. 
It probably was a nice place when it was well kept, but it is a shame that maintanance is not among their priorities.",ViniciusCastro,2011-05-01,223023,2011-05-31,False,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Poorest service ever” The hotel is stylish and the location is great. And they life of the fact that this is NY and they do not depend on returning customers. Otherwise clearly the would improve their service.
Our rooms were not ready at 4 pm for check in. We got asked to refresh in the restrooms which were in a appalling state. And we had asked the concierge to better have it cleaned for the next guests. 1.5 hrs later our rooms were still not ready. We then finally got rooms, but the luggage took 30 mins to find as the bell boys were all gone and with around 50 customers waiting for either rooms or luggage it was chaotic. Next day, my colleague tried to go to the fitness room. The lifts were blocked (as we later learned due to a large function the night before, they block the lift as reception level and do not serve lower. My colleague was asked to take the fire stairs. On the 2nd case the doors were locked and no inside handles. She had to wait until a security passed by to lead here the way. We later also learned during one of the many excuses from the staff that normaly after a function the fitness does not open until later in the morning and we should have been told that. At this point, one must remark that if you cannot open doors on the fire exits that this might be dangerous...That day, we needed to get ready for a customer meeting and my colleagues hairdryer exploded. As it was smoking she called reception - potential fire hazard. 15 minutes later when I left, I found her still standing out in the doorway with the hairdryer in hand. Nobody came to collect the faulty hairdryer or to replace it at all. Finally after all this, we came back with our customers late at night and went to the amazing bar outside. After the first round of drinks we were told that beer is out and when we tried to order wine, there was 1 bottle of red left. We asked the waitress if she could get it from the other bar inside and she told us she cannot as they get upset...(same hotel, same management!). As we complained to the manager on duty, we had been offered a complimentary breakfast, only to learn the next day when we went down to eat that there was an event and no breakfast could be served to us therefore. Now - all staff went out of their way to tell us it was not their fault. The staff has been very friendly, but not helpful at all. We have been told that the rooms were late ready because the housekeepers and bell boys lived out in Jersey and had a difficult way in due to rain (and it normally never rains in NY does it?).

"“Avoid! Trying to be clever, but failing.” We decided to go to this hotel based on the review in the Taschen book (usually on the money) but this really is a case of all style, poorly executed, with no substance or service.
I am a huge fan of America but there are two things that annoy me - the universal claim to do food and hotels better than anyone and yet the Hudson proves again that America can do neither of things well. 
As others have said the rooms are stupid - not just small, plain stupid. In our first room you sat on the bed that took up nearly all the floor space and looked straight through a glass window into the bathroom directly at the loo, so you can watch your loved one taking a dump. Delightful. 
The hotel reminds me of that Family Guy episode where Stewie and Brian open a club called pLace (small 'p' big 'L'). It's pretentious cr*p in short. These were the list of complaints:
- Rooms are miniscule - we even upgraded to the deluxe suite and still relatively small
- The Lobby is insanely dark that you literally cannot see - and the same for all the hallways
- General level of service very poor
- Pay $10 wifi and they then expect you to pay an additional $10 for every additional device in your room (inc iPhones etc)
- $17 for two coffees - $75 for breakfast (OJ, Coffee and cereal)
- Room falling apart
- Bathrooms look like they are from the Stasi HQ, not luxury showers rather decontamination blocks. Absolutely terrible.
- Don't get me started on the pretentious, w@nky food in the 'Too-cool for school College-style refectory'. The food was badly cooked and none of it went together. 'It's like Tapas man' is what we were told. When will Americans learn how to cook. Tapas, is Tapas. I do not want a new take on Tapas where you mix Bacalao with a Snickers bar and think you're cool because you're 'owning it'. The 'cooks' prepare one dish at a time but you have to go up and get it, so if you want fries with your steak (unseasoned, overcooked and with a weird jus) but the fries come first, then you're on the edge of your seat hopping up and down checking on the steak, which eventually comes 10 minutes later, once you've eaten your fries. Dumb beyond belief. 
- Tap water (from the bar too) tastes like it is stagnant and out of a hosepipe - undrinkable
- Common parts were stained and dirty
- Level of cleaning in the room each day was extremely scant
- Did not hoover once during the week we were there
- Also when enquiring with staff about numerous problems - which included having their laundry service ruin two of my shirts - we were met with an abrasive attitude
- Checkout is at 12 noon but when we arrived after a long flight at 5pm our ROOM WAS NOT READY - is this a joke?

“Excellent service and equally as impressive room” Spent Thanksgiving weekend at the Hudson Hotel and was very happy with the overall experience. The Bellman was extremely friendly and remembered my name throughout the weekend. Great location and a 5 minute walk to Central Park.,csinger,2010-11-01,223023,2011-06-13,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Horrible stay. Don't even bother to come here. Service is awful.” We only stayed for a night but it was more than enough. Our rooms were an hour delayed upon check in. Then we get to our room and we realized that the Tv does not work. There was a light on the screen that resfused to shut off. We tell our bell man about it and he said they will send someone up. Wait for an hour, no one comes. Call front desk and they said they were sending someone up. Wait another hour, and no one comes or calls. We then decide to leave for dinner. We also tried to figure out how to shut off the AC as it was like Siberia in the small room. Could not find the thermostat. We come back later that night, and stop by again at the reception asking for help with the tv and the AC. Again they say someone is coming up. We had to pretty much disconnect all the wires to the tv ourselves as the light on the screen was so bright we could not sleep. After nearly an hour of trying to locate the shut off valve for the AC, we found it hidden behind the bed. My husband was so furious about the lack of service that we had. The rooms are expensive and tiny. If we had gotten someone to address our concerns, that would have been a lot better. Addressed the issue the next day to the guest relation manager and knew she was only giving me lip service. Will never ever stay there again.

"“Loved this hotel would stay again” This hotel gets some really strange comments and I wanted to say that it was a lovely experience. The rooms were quite nice, the location perfect, the staff very friendly and professional and the setting quite nice. I liked the huge lobby and the crowd in the lobby was very elegant. I had no problems sleeping in the very comfortable bed, and although the bath is more like a European bath (a little small) but it was perfect for me. The room was very clean. The amenities (stereo, tv, hair dryer, iron, ironing board, toiletries) were excellent. There are also vending machines on each floor. I would stay there again as it was very reasonably priced.",AshtonNewOrleans,2011-03-01,223023,2011-03-20,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great stay at the Hudson” I had stayed at the Hudson more than 5 years ago, so I knew the rooms were small. But after reading Tripadvisor reviews, I was nervous when we got it via Priceline. At check-in, we received an upgrade (from Sabrina, who was very friendly & helpful behind the front desk). The room was small, but about average for boutique hotels in NYC. The room was clean, the staff was helpful. I brought earplugs after reading reviews about the noise, but we had no problems at all! The Sky Terrace was great for after-dinner drinks. And there are many subway lines right down the street.
Overall, it was a nice trip. It may not be a place where I'd stay in the most basic room with a family, but perfect for two people to rest after a busy day in the city.",Tallulah13,2011-05-01,223023,2011-05-29,True,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Poor” The hotel is great. The design and style absolutely great. But....the service was the worst ever. We arrived late afternoon, rooms were not available. They asked us to wait for 45 minutes, we came back after 1.5 hrs - still no rooms. They sent us to refresh in the rest rooms which were in an appaling state. After that we tried to get ready for a customer event in the evening during which the hairdryer from my colleague next door exploded. The device was smoking so she called downstairs and asked somebody to come up and get it as it is a potential fire hazard. 15 minutes later I left my room to find her standing outside with the haridryer - nobody had arrived. The next day the lifts did not go down to the fitness center - we were explained later that this was because they had a large event the night before - and my colleague was sent down the fire stairs. In the middle she was in front of a door without handles - which is slightly scary if you consider this to be the fire exit. She had to wait until some security came the other way. This not being enough, any time we raised a complaint, the staff, being very friendly, went out of their way to tell us it was not their fault, but were all not able to offer help. 
The manager on duty even told us that the rooms were not ready as it was raining and the housekeeping and the bell boys lived outside NY city and were delayed getting in...(well, it normally never rains in NY, does it?). That night, after the customer event, we cambe back with a crowd of people and we went to the wonderful bar outside. However, after the first round of drinks, we were told that they were out of beer! and when we ordered wine, we were told that they had exactely 1 bottle of red left. 
Finally, the manager on duty offered us a free breakfast for the last day. When we came down that day we were told by the lady that unfortunately, there was a closed party for breakfast and that no breakfast could be served to us. At this point, we could only laugh. 
Yes, the hotel is stunning, but in reality, they live of that and the fact that they do not have to worry about returning guests - the service is the poorest ever.",pemigi,2011-05-01,223023,2011-05-28,False,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Never never again” Whilst I like boutique hotels, this one goes too far. As many others have said it's dark. Very very dark. Is this trendy or just hiding dirt? I upgraded to a suite which spared me the micro room, but it still wasn't generous - I would estimate 350sq ft, and there still wasn't enough room to walk around the bed without bumping into the wall mounted TV.
The worst of it is the noise from the partying downstairs. Even on a Wednesday night it's unbearable until the small hours of the morning.
The room service menu is thin, and the food of average quality.
Lots of small things bug me - why no robes? Limited number of power sockets in the room. Internet access expensive and won't allow more than one device.
Back to the TriBeCa Grand next time - boutique is nice, but it needs to be done well.
What I really don't get is that the Morgans group hotel in San Francisco (the Clift) is so good and this one is so bad.

"“Spend fifty bucks more and stay at a real hotel!” The Public areas at the Hudson Hotel Look nice, but the rooms are pathetic. My 235 dollar room was tiny, and I do mean tiny!! There was hardly space to put down my suitcase. The room also lacked any natural light and several of the tv channels contained static. Like many Morgans/Ian schrager hotels, the hallways were dark to create a hip feel, but you felt the if they turned on the lights the place would just be depressing. On our floor, the hallways AC was leaking, so the staff had put down a towel on the floor....hardly inviting! Checkin was chaotic and took too long....to make things worse, my room wasn't ready when I arrived.

My friend needed a safety pin and when we inquired about one, the consierge sent an employee to our room within 5 minutes with a whole handfull of them in various sizes! The room was a lot bigger than I expected, considering all of the bad reviews on the small rooms. The thing you have to realize is, that it is NYC.

"“All fur Coat and no Knickers” This establishment needs to decide what it wants to be; a hotel or a nightclub. The hotel plays extremely loud music in its central atrium, onto which a large number of rooms overlook , and whilst this may appeal to to some, the word is, if you want to sleep/be functional during the daylight hours of your trip then do not stay here. In order to sleep I had to bury my head between two pillow and use my noise cancelling headphones. If you call room service then you are put into an answering loop that never picks up and eventually goes dead - but there are numerous eating options on the block and around town. . BTW - if you are reading this review and like the idea of a loud hotel - the music playing - Stevie Wonder/Human League. All greats in their time! - been here all week - sounds like a loop. 
Try calling reception and they never answer.

"“Dreadfully pretentious hotel, surviving on its 'image'” This hotel, is without doubt, the worst hotel that I have ever had the misfortune to stay in.
Yes, that's a harsh opening statement. But it is also a true one. If you get the chance to read the other reviews for this hotel you'll notice it is a common theme, so isn't just me who has had a bad experience.
First off, I'll start with a positive. This hotel does have the odd redeeming feature. From the outside it looks smart. You enter through the door and go up an escalator into one of the most amazing (if dark) lobby's I've ever seen. It's smart. Trendy. It's dark, so you may feel like you are walking into an Abercrombie store.
The Library is fantastic. Amazingly flash room. The Dining Room (apologies if I got the name wrong) is brilliant. They project sports onto the walls in the morning - lovely touch. And the outside bar is great with oversized plant pots and plenty of seats to enjoy a beer whilst taking in NYC.
OK. Positives out of the way. Let's get onto the meat.
1. Check In
Massive queues with no staff to open more lines. And not just on the day we checked in. Every day, without fail, there would be queues of people 6/7 deep waiting to check in.
The group of people I was with checked in at 3.30pm after a long flight from Europe. Despite check-in advertised from 3pm, there room wasn't made available until after 5pm. Oddly they made us wait in the bar without any complimentary drinks! Cher-ching to the Hudson.
2. Lifts
It's a big hotel with 23 floors, but the lifts are woefully inadequate. Expect to have a good wait, especially when heading down to the lobby. Obviously I don't expect them to build in a new lift shaft to help with demand, but it's worth being aware of.
3. The Rooms
This is the biggie. I've been to NYC a couple of times before and I don't expect big rooms. Not at all. This is New York after all.
HOWEVER.. the rooms in the Hudson Hotel are ridiculous. I didn't take a tape measure with me.. can't think why, but I'd estimate the sleeping area (with bed, desk & chair) to be 3m squared. The bathroom is the worst. Good luck trying to sit on the toilet without your legs squeezing between the toilet and wall. Sure I'm a guy and I'm tall. But my wife isn't and she had to sit at an angle just to use the facilities. 
The shower and basin however are nice and the overall aesthetics of both rooms are nice.
4. Noise
Again this is NYC so I was expecting noise, however the windows offer very little protection from the outside noise. There was little persevable difference in noise level with the window open or closed.
Thursday, Friday & Saturday nights are the worst. One of the bars downstairs turns into a club open to the public. I'm sure it's lovely and trendy. However the noise gets even worse with music and people audible until after 2am. I was on the 7th floor but colleagues were on the 15th and could still hear the noise.
5. Service
The staff are rude, unhelpful and care little for the residents of the hotel. One example, even though we had left our towels out to be changed, it didn't happen for 3 days. We even went to reception one lunchtime and asked them if housekeeping could send new ones. They said yes they would be sent straight away but no towels arrived until the following morning.
The staff continue to have conversations with each other, rather than helping out.
We even had someone chase after us because they weren't satisfied with the tip we had give them. Sure, I could probably have tipped more but I tip when I receive good service. 
6. Food
The food we had (breakfast) and room service was nice. The room service number didn't pick up one night when calling for 20 minutes. We called the front desk and was told someone would call us back. They didn't. No surprise.
The pizza on the room service was deliciousness, however breakfast is incredibly expensive for what it is. Breakfast for 2 cost us $73. Just pop outside for a Starbucks instead.

"“Much better than anticipated.” We ended up here as a result of ""pricelining"". read the reviews at trip advisor and thought this didn't sound much like a four star (what we had put in for our priceline bid). we were particularly concerned because, at the moment because of physical limitations, we need a walk-in shower, and priceline is pretty minimalist about what needs you might expect to be met (you pretty much get a basic double and take your chances). I called and spoke with the desk clerk: I'm so sad I didn't get her name because she was a doll. I explained my need and that the reservation had been made via Priceline so I knew she might not be able to help. Instead, she said she'd find me an ADA accessible room at no additional cost. When we arrived we found she had put us in a deluxe double queen size bed room with a marvelous walk-in shower, far more luxurious than we anticipated.

"“Not the trendy, ""current"" hotel I had hoped it would be” Back in the day, I visited Hudson's bar as a New Yorker. At the time it felt sophisticated and cool. So when I booked here for a business trip, I assumed the rooms would capture that same vibe. Mmm, not so much.
First, the positives: the service is efficient. I arrived early and a room wasn't ready but reception quickly checked me in anyway so I could save time later, helped store a bag and hooked me up with wifi. When I returned after my conference, I was also quickly served and given a room. 
Alas, the room. 
I don' t mind small rooms at all. This is New York City and you should be outside, not in your room anyway. This small room, however, had seen better days. Chipped accessories, poorly spackled walls, an overall dated feel. The trendy aspect to the Hudson feels limited to its bar. The hallways also felt a bit dorm-like and the ""mood"" lighting just felt sad.
Back on the pluses, the location is fantastic - Central Park and Columbus Circle are steps away along with many subways.
It's not that I wouldn't recommend Hudson altogether. But having stayed at Gansevoort, the W, Crosby Street, Soho Grand I don't feel like this hotel is at all on the same level.

"“Triumph of style over content” Four of us stayed at the Hudson Hotel for 3 nights at the end of March, but it felt like much, much, longer... The reception area is amazing - buzzing and spacious - but upstairs it's a different story. This hotel feels a bit sorry for itself and seriously needs a make-over. I had a broken window, 2 broken phones, broken AC, a banging radiator and a broken bed in the three rooms I was moved between, amid promises from the night manager, which came to nothing. Eventually upgraded to a bigger room with a bottle of water by the bed - thought this might be complimentary - but oh no, $8 added to the bill (twice by mistake - 1 eventually refunded after a fuss). Beware breakfast too - $47 for a help-yourself cooked breakfast - wow! This hotel trades on its style and good value rooms (or that's what our company thought), but both are an illusion - beware the extras, lack of space, dim (green) lighting and noise.

Never accept a room facing the inner courtyard on the lower floors. The music from the lobby and bar come right through the wall. On my last night I was able to get about an hour of sleep before my 5AM wake up call (the Bar closes around 3:30 AM)
Nothing really worked in the room: TV remote dead, AC/Heat did not work and when it did had a lound knocking noise. Also the window was sealed shut (I could not even open it for the approved inch or two of fresh air)

"“I HEART HUDSON - Cool, Funky and Quirky place” Me and my boyfriend's (20-somethings) first time in NYC (May 2008) and we decided to do it in style and stay at the Hudon Hotel on West 58th. 
Its a great location, right beside Columbus Circle and just on the South West corner of Central Park (where all the buggies line up to offer you a ride). 
The Hotel is essentially a nightclub. There were people standing outside (smokers) as we rocked up in our cab on the first evening and as we went up the illuminated yellow escalotors into the lobby, house music pumped throughout. Very fun atmosphere and fabulous music!. 
The lobby is a glorified conservatory - there is ivy covering the ceiling and the reception desk runs along the back wall. The staff were very friendly (although had to wait about 40 mins for our luggage to be brought up to our room once we had checked in). 
Be warned! Everything is very dim-lit in this place! (a common theme in NY it seems). Our room was on the top floor. We had a deluxe room (basically 2 double beds and a bathroom), Do not expect to have much space, we paid top dollar to have this room as we had heard that the other rooms in this hotel (and everywhere else in NYC are teeny tiny). It was definately worth spending that bit extra. Lovely soft linen, comfortable beds, lots of mirrors but so so so dark. The bathroom was basic. It was jazzed up by the modern sink but the shower was aged and needed a re-vamp. But the water pressure was good and it was clean and thats what counts. 
We could hear quite alot of noise from the room next door at night. People who had obviously spent their evening in the bar downstairs and had come up to carry on their drinking. Not great but it was ok. 
We did wonder why everyhting (even in the corridors) was so dark and we concluded that it was a good mask for the peeling paintwork and pretty drab corridor decor. But the rest of the hotel and the City make up for the couple of bad points this palce has.
We didnt drink grab a drink at the bar as there were so many other places we wanted to hit in Manhattan, but it looked great and was heaving on Friday and Saturday night. Great music also!
The terrace bar looked very lovely but was just thatt little bit too cold to sit out while we were there. 
The Hudson was a great place to stay. It is very cool and had alot to offer. Very New York. We would definately stay there again.",Ted-the-Traveller,2010-05-01,223023,2011-03-14,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Stay here..if you're 5'5 and 150 lbs only and can see in the dark” The Hudson is a boutique hotel which is code for small rooms and expensive. This room was booked using Priceline.com, otherwise I would have booked elsewhere after seeing the hotel website. The hotel thinks poor lighting is atmosphere, the hotel lobby is dark - low lighting, the furniture is dark, the front desk is dark. Looking left and right - dark. The elevators are small, thankfully they have 7 elevators, because maybe 4 people with luggage can fit in one. Step into the small poorly lit elevator and every person I rode with did the same thing: bent over and ran their fingers up and down counting to locate the floor number - BECAUSE the panel was poorly lit. Step off the elevator into poorly lit small hallways, painted a depressing taupe brown and as a solo female traveler the hallways caused some concerns due to dark corners. My first room was so far from the elevators the housekeeping staff had to show me back to the elevators, so that I could change rooms. The 2nd room was closer to the elevators but next to the housekeeping laundry drop !! The room was a deluxe king - really? Since I'm not 5'5"" and 110 pounds the small bathroom was tight, sitting on the toilet I could rest my head against the wall in front of me!! The tub drained slow, the fix was to remove the stopper. There's no dresser so u live out your bag. The bed had good pillows (4) and the heat/ac was working, I used the A/C (early March) because the hotel was HOT or felt hot to me maybe it was the tight hallways but I would break a sweat getting to my room. I was able to open the one window to get fresh air. I know it's NY and I shouldn't be in my room, but as the maid said ""you pay alot to stay here"" so I was expecting a lot more. The hotel is pretencious and poorly lit with small small rooms. The lack of lighting made me uncomfortable several times going for ice or coming back to my room, so if you're a single female traveler stay away. I didn't use the bar or library but I did use room service..the food came quickly and was prepared as promised but was nothing special. If you want a luxury experience with pillow menu, large comfortable bed and decent sized bathroom stay at an American chain hotel - Doubletree, Hampton, Omni, Sheraton ...your paying the same almost but they have well lit hallways and amenities for regular people.",rosforme,2011-03-01,223023,2011-03-13,False,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“First Impression not great but pleasantly surprised” Arrived late Friday night when club in full swing! Check in difficult as you can not hear your self think the Hotel is lit only by the iluminous green escalator that takes you to the lobby, my first impressions were Dark, Loud and BUSY lotsand lot of people hanging around entrance which has no sign outside you could go past it with out noticing its a hotel. 
Every where in this hotel is dark the lobby the bar the library the hallways all very very dark but on entering the deluxe double double room I was pleasantly surprised two double beds in a dark wood panelled room mirrors either side of beds and flat screen tv and stereo bathroom nice and clean emaculate white bedding comfy beds very nice.
Hotel is located near central park its quite convenient for travelling around. 24 hour shop nearby selling most things you may need. Vending machines on each floor with drinks food and ice not too over priced either.
Lovely place for breakfast Cascade on 54th street at 8th Avenue very friendly and food delicious. 
travelling around on metro quite easy and most people who we asked were extremely helpful. hop on and off tour bus was ok but some of tour guides were slightly strange! telling you more about home life than new york!

"“In and out” Hudson offered a great rate of $159 w/ breakfast for a last minute business-trip to NYC. The public spaces are very attractive with a lively social crowd (this is a nightllfe-oriented hotel scene). Travelers looking for a respite should look elsewhere.
The room was roughly cruise-ship sized with room for a queen size platform bed and my overnight garment bag. The tv connection was weak but I tinkered with it to tune in to CNN. The hallways are quite dark to hide their simplicity.
The breakfast really impressed me. I know that sounds crazy but I had Fage yogurt with fresh fruit, pastries, juice, and coffee. Not bad for a free meal and a quick, healthy start to the day.
I checked in at 7pm and ran out to dinner. I then came home, crashed, had a quick morning run in the gym (very mediocre - get an Equinox pass if you really want a workout), and checked out right before breakfast at 7:30am.

"“I wouldnt stay here again” it was my first trip to New York with my wife and we chose the Hudson for its location. The location was the only positive that I could count in my review of the Hudson hotel. Situated by Columbus Circle near the entrance to Central Park, the hotel is in a really good place for hopping onto the subway or bus.
The reception staff were very welcoming, Matthew on reception was really helpful. We had upgraded from a standard room after reading reports on here after we had booked the hotel. No real complaints about the size of the room although we're used to having drawers and a wardrobe to put our clothes etc in, and there was just a rail for hanging stuff on in our room.
The lighting throughout the hotel is strange and very subdued, but having no real bright lighting in our hotel room was a bit off putting for my wife doing her makeup and hair.
The bathroom created our main concern. We werent too bothered about the toilet roll holder hanging off the wall or the mould around the bath seal, but on the third day of our stay the toilet blocked up at 8am and started to overflow onto the bathroom floor. We immediately phoned reception who said they would send up an engineer straight away. We went out for breakfast, came back after an hour to pick up stuff and the toilet was still blocked, no one had been to it and the bathroom was in a state..and it stank. I went down to reception, told them again and they said that they ""were on it"" and an engineer would be right up. We went off into the city and returned at 4pm. Guess what..the toilet was still blocked and overflowing. The housekeeper had cleaned the bathroom and put bath towels around the toilet to soak up the spillage...gross. we phoned down to reception, they again said the engineer ""was on it"" and would be there straight away, half an hour later my wife went down to reception and complained, they said the engineer would be at our room before she was...half an hour later, and needing the toilet I went down to reception and really had to lose my temper with the staff who thought it was a big joke that I had to go down eleven floors to go to the toilet. I demanded that the duty manager came out, which he did and he promptly came to our room to look...only 9hours after it had been reported. The maintenance manager then dashed into our room with no word...cleared the toilet leaving half the contents on the bathroom floor and merely said..""you need housekeeping now"".
the duty manager was really apologetic and could give no reason why it had taken so long to fix the toilet...and offered us a free cocktail!!
If this is the level of service offered by the hotel, well I'm afraid you can stick your cocktails mate.

"“An excuses orientated hotel when you have a problem. Stark design with poor maintenance” We checked in at the Hudson yesterday 19th February after a 12 hour journey from the UK. We had contacted the hotel 2 months in advance confirm our booking with a request for a bath tub. The request was clearly stated for medical reason and we assured that this would be no problem.
Once we got to the room we found the bath tub to be 2/3 the size of a standard tub when you can just about sit in it. The guest experience team told us all rooms contain the same bath size but other hotel staff claim to be untrue. 
We have had to change rooms due to a faulty window and draft in the room to now being in a room with a faulty shower head. After a long journey and a bad start to our trip, we have no choice to accept these poor standards.
The hotel have offered a refund via British Airways which will take another of weeks but this would mean we would have book another hotel. We have 5 days and a full itinerary so this isn't an option. However, if we had known about the tub, we would have booked elsewhere 2 months ago.
The air condition comes on with a racket in the middle of the night than switches off and the blinds mangled on the window.
Don't be fooled but the Pillipe Starke design. This hotel is poorly maintained and managed.

"“New York chic” I stayed here 5 nights recently for business at the tail end of a cold New York winter. The unassuming entrance led into a gorgeous lobby that you might mistake for a club front desk, complete with the dimly lit sitting area and huge chandelier. 
The room was big enough for 1 but if you're a pair, it might be a squeeze. The toilet and bed was adequate, and toiletries were replenished daily. There is no fridge but there are vending machines outside and an ice machine. Despite the blistering cold outside the room was toasty and I managed to catch some decent sleep every night. The TV was not working on my first night and it took 3 calls for front desk to send the repairman.
The location of the hotel is a stroll away from Columbus Circle (where there is a fab supermarket on the lower level) and Central Park. Breakfast can be found in the nearby diners and takeaway Japanese available at Teriyakiboy just around the corner. The Business Centre on the 3rd floor offered 2 computers, 2 printers and a photocopier which required your credit card if you intended to print or copy. The photocopier and stapler was not working and I had to ask a hotel staff who was nearby to send someone up to fix them. Wi-fi was available at US$10 for 24 hours.
I would recommend this place only if you're traveling solo or if you're into tiny boutique hotels with a personality. Don't expect any friendly service from the frosty front desk - it must have been part of the New York vibe(?). The bellmen were much nicer and friendlier though.
All in all it was an OK experience here, the only reason my office booked here was the attractive rates. It would have been an otherwise pleasant experience had it not been marred by a taxi tout at JFK that tricked me into paying a crazy exorbitant fee on the ride into the hotel which I later discovered was only US$45 on the meter!

"“Dark, Dirty and HORRID service” My business partner and I booked at the Hudson for a trip to NYC based on its amazing website and the story that it tells. At face value, its a modern, young and hip place in the heart of Manhattan. Dig a bit deeper and its a dirty, dingy, dark, obnoxious place with absolutely terrible service.
Now take this with a grain of salt, because I'm in the hotel business, and have very high expectations of hotels, but when I come to NYC and book at a 3 star property in Manhattan I expect it to be better than a Holiday Inn. The truth is that I'd rather stay at HI than Hudson.
We had four main experiences with the staff that leads us to believe that their service is all around terrible and not limited to one person or incident.
The rooms are small, dark, and the ceiling was falling apart in ours. The shower...well the shower curtain is a piece of papier-mâché that wants to wrap itself around you whenever you're in there...and if you think about that - it does it to everyone that showers in the room, and my bet is that those are cleaned once a year. GROSS.
The beds - I woke up at least 3 times and my first thought was that I was sleeping on a box spring with no mattress. YES - they are THAT bad.
I could go on and on and on about how bad this place is, but I wont. Just take your money elsewhere unless you like to be ripped off.

"“Pleasantly surprised!” We stayed at the Hudson for four nights during our first trip to NYC. The hotel was recommended to us by my partner’s colleagues, due to its location, however , after booking the trip and reading the reviews on TripAdvisor I was apprehensive (to say the least!) about our choice of hotel. My main concerns were the bathroom with glass wall (I value my privacy), and the stories of loud music coming from the club throughout the night.
Following an early morning and long flight, we arrived at the hotel almost spot on 3pm and went to check in- we were advised that check in was currently unavailable but to wait, and we would be called over 5-10 minutes later. 10 minutes later we noticed plenty of other people checking in without any problems, so my partner queued again and was successful in securing our room key. There were many others waiting around reception with their suitcases in the same predicament. 
The (standard) room was a very pleasant surprise- we were on the 10th floor, with no noise audible from the club (and relatively little from the street), the room had plenty of space for suitcases etc. and felt compact, rather than claustrophobic. The bathroom did have a clear glass wall, but when using the curtains outside and inside (there is a sheer curtain outside and two shower curtains on the inside) you couldn’t see a thing. My partner did struggle slightly with the size of the bathroom (he is 6ft 4in), but not enough to make it an issue. The bed was comfy, and the room was warm.
There are a number of great restaurants within walking distance from the hotel- our favourites were Eatery, El Centro and Sushi Damo- along with a great Whole Foods Store at Columbus Circle. Most of the time we walked around Manhattan (a slow walk from the hotel down to the financial district took a couple of hours), but the subway is easily accessible at Columbus Circle. We didn’t utilise any of the hotel amenities (e.g. gym, bar, cafeteria etc.) so can’t comment on those. The hotel doesn't offer free Wi-Fi so my suggestion would be to visit the Starbucks very close by (<2 min walk) and use theirs.
The only negative comment I do have is in relation to the staff at the reception desk, and I agree with other reviews that they can be very rude- in addition to our problems checking in, an example is one morning my partner wanted directions to a well known toy store, which happens to be round the corner from the hotel- we went up to a well staffed, empty desk and after eventually being acknowledged by the guy behind the counter were told (rather rudely) that we would have to go and ask the concierge. It would have taken him seconds to answer our question and we would have been left with a much better impression.

"“We really enjoyed our stay - but it's not for everyone” The good:
Good location - close to the subway and Central Park. Great vibe, slick design. Amazing foyer. Nice (but expensive) bars. Whilst the rooms are small, they're well designed, so it didn't bother us too much. The vending machine in the lobby was pretty funky.
The bad:
You'll have trouble in the rooms if you're very large or tall. Although it didn't bother me too much, the rooms are small and the bathroom is tiny - only the teeny shower bothered me a little. The room had a very loud radiator that would turn on at 5am and wake us up, and the powerpoints seemed to have trouble if we plugged in more than one thing at a time. The work table is tiny and lamp very dim. No mini bars in the room.
The verdict:
We really enjoyed our stay here. It has a cool vibe and it's quite a unique stay - but it's not for everyone. The hotel is dark and has a nightclub vibe. If that doesn't appeal to you - or if you are very tall or overweight - I wouldn't recommend staying here. If you are a single traveller or young couple - I'd highly recommend this hotel.

"“Dark, ""trendy"" over service” Tiny rooms; we were told by reception staff that as we were staying for 5 nights, it would be best if we upgraded as rooms very small.

Very dark room, too. No hospitality tray for tea, coffee or water.

"“Fun for a weekend, but NOT a business hotel” Spent 10 days here in May 2011 (working in NY).

Negatives - NOT a hotel that you would want to spend more than a weekend in. Tiny rooms, very slow service at both Concierge and Front Desk. And nowhere to get quiet dinner.

"“Has potential but not going back” My wife and I stayed at the Hudson to celebrate our first anniversary, and while there were certain things we really liked about it, we have decided we are not coming back. The location is great and the sky terrace is both beautiful and well designed for accommodating individuals and groups. It was nice to spend some time in the morning just lounging up there. The other bars are also quite nice.
But the front desk area is a poorly designed. Its an incredibly wide check-in desk with little direction. Even though there were only several people waiting, it took surprisingly long to get through check in and everyone seemed generally confused about how to form up and where to go. Not really a good impression. Then, for whatever reason, only two of the five elevators were running, so the back was ridiculous (add at least one wedding reception to the congestion). Thankfully we were only a few floors up so we walked it, but I felt back for those on the 20+ floors. When we finally got to our room (a deluxe king), we turned right around because it was a smoking room. Not only did it reek of smoke, there was also an ashtray on the night stand. Later we found out from a doorman that the fifth floor is smoking. With the only remaining availability left, they upgraded us to a deluxe studio that still needed to be cleaned (so we didn't get into the room till after dinner), but they did give us two complimentary drinks for their bars which was nice. So despite the wrong room, the front desk handled it well. 
The room itself was alright. The wood walls are beautiful, but the furniture (two chairs and a sofa for the studio) is clearly for decoration only as they are ridiculously uncomfortable. Also, its odd that there were no lights (overhead or lamp) in the living room section of the room. So while I probably wouldn't have spent the morning reading on the couch because of how uncomfortable it is, I couldn't have simply because of poor lighting. I also thought the bed was pretty uncomfortable. 
One last thing. The fire alarm in our room started making very loud noises about 2am. I called down to the front desk to explain that it wasn't flashing but randomly beeping very loudly, perhaps because the battery was dying, and they said they'd send someone up. At 245am, after no one had come, I called back down and they reported that apparently someone was setting off false fire alarms on several floors. Thankfully it stopped randomly beeping, but it was frustrating that they neither came up to check (after they said they would) nor that they called back to explain the situation. 
Overall, the interaction with the staff was generally good. The front desk and the bellmen did what they could. It would've been nice if the guys working in the luggage storage would have told us they close up at 9pm and you have to use the bellmen out front (since we had to drop our bags off when we headed out for dinner). Also, I was a bit surprised to see two of the guys working in the luggage storage argue in front of a number of guests instead of dealing with their disagreements more discreetly. 
Since working at a luxury boutique hotel in Seattle, I recognize that sometimes things happen, but in this case, too many things did. So we wont be heading back, which is a shame, because the sky terrace is fantastic.",jps81,2011-06-01,223023,2011-06-22,False,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Nice Hotel But Wish There was more light” My husband and I stayed for three nights at the Hudson to attend a wedding. The room was nice and clean but small, which we expected so it was not a surprise. However, the lighting was very poor in the bathroom. Since I was getting ready for a wedding I wanted to see myself in the mirror. I had to take my mirror and set it up by the window in order to put on makeup. There were two big mirrors on the wall but none was a full-length mirror so I could see how I looked. The dim lighting is carried throughout the hotel--the hallways are dark, the lobby is dark, especially by the bank of elevators, the dining room is dark. My room card did open the door twice and we had to get new cards, which was annoying because we had to go down to the lobby to get that taken care of. Also didn't like the music that was played in the elevator, most annoying.

"“The Perfect Valentine Getaway” My boyfriend and I were looking to do something very romantic in Manhattan. We are residents of New York City and thought it would be fun to get away at a nice hotel in the city. We chose the Hudson hotel near the Columbus Circle area. Everything about our stay was perfect, it made our first Valentine's together that more memorable. We checked in on a Saturday afternoon at 3pm. We were helped by Hudson Regional Guest Experience Manager, Ms. Shacazia Brown. She was very pleasant, knowledgeable and all smiles upon our arrival. She made us feel very welcomed and seemed thankful about having our business. We were checked into our room within 5 minutes. She gave us a brief tour of the hotel's Library Bar, Hudson Bar and Restaurant area. She knew in advance that is was a special romantic weekend and presented us with chocolates and a bottle of champagne in our deluxe studio room. The decor was amazing- dark, hardwood floors with white and silver steel furniture. I must have said at least three times during our stay, ""I want to LIVE here"". Instead of visiting the MOMA, we ended up taking a nap for two hours after feeling how comfortable our queen size bed felt. After we returned from dinner, we had reservations at the Library Bar near a fireplace. It was such a romantic setting for celebrating our love. We relaxed for an hour and went back to our room to freshen up. We had 11pm reservations at the Hudson bar and were seated immediately. The DJ played great tunes all night as we sipped champagne, ate strawberries and danced. The party was filled with people of all different ages and cultures. It was nice to be in a different atmosphere for a change. We ended the night sleeping like babies in our comfortable bed. The next morning we had breakfast at Hudson's beautiful rustic style restaurant. The breakfast selection was divine and my palate was extremely satisfied.

"“Quirky, interesting hotel but rooms like broom cupboards” On arrival I was greeted by the welcoming staff outside the hotel, and then went up an escalator to the front desk. Another friendly individual checked me in at the desk in the stylish lobby. The room I was allocated was nicely decorated with some interesting features such as i-pod dock and stereo, but there wasn't room to walk all the way around the queen-size bed, and I've stayed in rooms with shower cubicles that have been bigger than the whole bathroom – which had a glass wall between it and the bedroom! There was some clever usage of the small space, with a wardrobe tucked away in one corner.
As I was in New York on business I was disappointed that I had to pay for WiFi and the desk in the room, with an uncomfortable and cold solid metal chair, was not really suitable for a business user on a laptop. One of my colleagues had read a review about the hotel being noisy – the bar area behind the desk in the lobby did seem quite lively, with loud music - but none of this carried to my room on the seventh floor that overlooked the bar area. The bed was comfortable and I got a good night's rest.
The restaurant, the Hudson Hall was very good, especially for a sizable group.

"“Great location and fantastic staff” We recently stayed here for Mother's day weekend. The location is fantastic, right across the street from Central Park. The hotel is not well marked on the outside, but once inside you are in a totally different world. The outside noise is not heard and the ambiance, is very relaxing. The Staff was helpful in every way possible, from a free upgrade because our room wasnt available to the wait staff at the bars. The drinks were outstanding, though at NYC prices ($16 per), but well worth it. The room was a bit small, but had all that you needed in it. It was clean, and upto date with no issues.

"“Could be so much more” I have to say the staff was wonderful and the atmosphere was everything you could ask for so it was very disappointing how it ended up. It looks like a warehouse from the street but then you go up the escalator and its beautiful! Music playing, great crowd. OK so now the bad part - I got off the elevator and it went straight down hill. Dark small hallways. Room Numbers on the walls were falling off and missing. Opened up the room and almost died. The small bed filled the entire room and was very low. The room smelled like cleaning supplies but I could not find the restroom. I panicked and thought we would have to use a community restroom. I kid you not.. Then my daughter leaned on the wall and the bathroom door moved. It was the size of a closet. I am only 5ft. 4in. and when you sit on the toilet your knees hit the wall!!!.The toilet was obviously replaced and the caulking around the base was disgusting. I was so seriously claustrophobic. They should open up a few of the rooms to make one room and then they would have a hotel that Human beings could actually stay at.

"“Great Service, Funky Hotel but Terrible Mattress” We went here for my wife's birthday - shopping trip to NYC. The hotel is incredibly funky with very low level, nightclub like, lighting, very impressive as you come up the escalators. the staff where very helpful and polite. Once they had remembered to upgrade us as per the booking offer we were placed in a Loft room, thankfully as the Queen Superior was claustophobically a bed with a 2 foot of space around it and a window above the bed only.
Sadly the room let the hotel down - large cracks in the wall, plug points hanging off the wall and a mattress reminiscent of sleeping on a pull out futon, not what you'd expect from this price of hotel. 
The bathroom is tiny but functional, not the kind of place for a bath for two but it was well maintained and serviced through out our stay.
There was quite a bit of noise from the streets 17 floors below but personally that made it more authentically NY.

"“UNEXPECTED SURPRISE” We booked the Hudson Hotel for a Girl's Getaway in NYC and had reserved the Double Double Room. It was very busy. As we were opening our hotel room - to our surprise, there was someone already in our reserved room. Apparently we were told that there was a computer glitch. Not sure how this can happen and makes me wonder just how safe it is for a female travelling alone. However, the Manager and staff were very apologetic and gave us instead two single rooms - free our charge, and vouchers for a free breakfast and free drinks. The second night everything was straightened out and we got our Double Double Room. From the outside, the hotel can easily be missed. You enter up an escalator and then you are wowed by this large entrance with vine-covered skylight. The rooms were all very clean and I appreciated the wood floors. The Double Double Room is decent size but the single room is pretty small. All the common spaces are really nice and especially enjoyed The Hudson Bar. Very trendy hotel.

"“Shockingly Bad” Try's to be achingly hip but Try's way too hard and fails.
Everywhere in the hotel is too dark - it kind of gets you down.

We had a broken door lock so my 3 year old son could go running around at anytime. A broken window so he could jump out the window. Oh and a broken toilet that was repaired but then they left a load of dirty toilet roll on the floor.
We complained at the time and filled in the feedback form but have never heard back from them since.

"“It’s become my “home away from home” in NYC” I have been staying The Hudson Hotel regularly for the last 6 years. That itself speaks to how satisfied I am with the hotel. I’ve stayed elsewhere in NYC on occasion (because the Hudson was already booked,) and I can say that in comparison, the Hudson is my overwhelming favorite. It’s become my “home away from home” in NYC. I’ve read some other reviews that have comments about small rooms and the hotel getting a little worn around the edges (although, on the whole, the vast majority of reviews are quite positive.) Well, honestly, in terms of room-size, for a standard, basic rate, I haven’t found any fine boutique hotel that can match the Hudson on that front. Sure you can get a “bigger” room at a more “affordable” hotel, but you would miss out on the Hudson’s fine location, well-designed, sophisticated, and stylized rooms and common spaces (their bars, lounges, etcetera,) and the fine service they deliver. From the bellmen to the reception staff, and housekeeping to food service, everyone at the Hudson is there to ensure you have a great visit. The hotel’s GEMs (Guest Experience Managers) are exactly that: “gems.” They are always at the ready to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. As for getting “worn around the edges,” I would point out that every hotel might be a “perfect 10” on day one when they first open, but the sign of an exceptional hotel is how they keep step with general upkeep and with renovations, and I would say again, no one beats the Hudson on that front either. Besides, when I read those few comments I thought about the fact that while you’re visiting NYC and relishing all it has to offer, how much it really matters that you feel comfortable where you’re staying. And, as I said, when I stay at the Hudson it’s like home to me, and I don’t know about you, but most everyone’s “home” is not “perfect,” but you still love being there.",Greg071,2011-01-01,223023,2011-02-04,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“most amazing vacation EVER!!!!!” Much like you guys, i read every review on this hotel before my trip. I was a bit afraid of what i may have run in to since everyone was complaining on size of rooms and complaints about the staff........i was pleasantly surprised!!! From the time we got to the Hudson, everyone on the staff was extremely nice! We did not mention our anniversary when we made the reservations and were given an upgraded room as soon as they found out! And yes, the rooms are small.....but come on people, its new york city!!! The hotel is beautiful and while rooms may have been small, they are quite manageable for two people. But really, all your doing is sleeping and bathing there! We were not kept awake any nights by sounds from bar downstairs or from anyone staying in rooms next to us. For the price we paid and just the great location of the hotel in general, i would definately stay there again. my one, and only one, complaint would be that the room was hot. So, i suggest that you ask the staff for a fan if your hotblooded like me!

"“The best value / experience in NYC hotels” I've stayed in about 20 different hotels in New York, from well known chains to boutique hotels. Over the past year, the Hudson Hotel has been my first choice whenever I make plans to visit the City, whether for work or for play.
If you are visiting NYC as a tourist, he hotel is conveniently located to so many different things in the City that you'll want visit. If you are in town on business, and you have clients in Midtown Manhattan, the Hudson is in walking distance to many landmark office buildings. 
The hotel itself is beautiful. The bar and restaurant areas are hip, modern and offer great food and drink options. The rooms are great as well - if you can work it in your budget, try getting a deluxe king mini-suite option. The staff is friendly, roomservice is delicious, and the concierge desk is extremely helpful to find great restaurants in walking distance (such as Blue Ribbon and Quality Meats - both a ""must"" if you are a foody).

"“Over rated, over priced............over it.” I am pretty sure that if there is a hell, the Hudson Hotel is pretty much a replica of Lucifer's lair...........perhaps without the garish green neon lighting.
The room was so tiny it is beyond ridiculous, the bathroom is a joke, literally impossible to turn around 360 degrees with your arms spread out - oh, I was actually in a 'superior room' so I dread to think what size shoebox a 'standard room' would be.. 
And a hotel that rates itself as highly as this one does should surely provide free wifi access?

"“some reviews made me concerned, but the cleanliness made me want to return” It does not have standard beds, but they are quite comfortable. The shower is not made for over-sized people, but it is quite stimulating to see your spouse through the clear glass partition. But the best of all... it is exceptionally clean! I would eat off the solid wood floor if I had to. And yes - the location of the wall mounted TV could be better than 90 deg from the bed, but I didn't go to NYC to watch TV... but to be in the TV audience. And the hotel personnel were always friendly and extremely helpful. 
At check-in.... When I mentioned my wife and I were celebrating our anniversry and I caually asked if there was an upgrade available... we got a queen Superior room... at no extra charge. Can we have a late check-out? No problem; Before we check-out I asked - Can you keep our bags in a secure location but will pick them up say 6pm? Sure we can. This earned a $10 tip just for that convenience.

"“To quote Bette Davis, ""What A Dump!""” You know you're in for an experience when you come off the escalator into the darkened lobby and can barely see anything. Behind you is the floor lit bar that looked so hot in last year's televised Lady Gaga interview. In front is a reception desk peopled by incompetent, good looking types who can resolve no problems with reservations, can't handle straight forward inquiries regarding meeting space, nor don't know who to ask for answers. And, reservation issues we had! As for that ""hot"" bar. Totally uncomfortable with the worst seating in town. There is a very comfortable bar hidden around the corner and it is the best thing about this hotel.
As for that experience you know you are going to have -- it's not a good one. Of course, I never did get the type of room I had reserved in the 4 nights I was there. What I got was dark, small, uncomfortable, no closet, no place to put clothing, suitcases, crappy television, and a window looking out into a well. A noisy well. By the way, the 2 lamps in the room were remarkably difficult to turn on and off. No shelf, no cabinet, no place to place toiletries in the bathroom except on the toilet. No thanks!
The hall way getting to my room was dark, dreary, smelly and went on forever.
We finally obtained a meeting room for our 3 days of business meetings. Calling room service for coffee and water delivery to our meeting we were told room service could not deliver to meeting rooms, only guest bedrooms. Swept up in small piles around our meeting room were piles of sawdust and dirt as though the room had recently been remodeled and not yet cleaned.

"“Dance Club Moonlighting as a Hotel” This is NOT a hotel. It is a nightclub with 240 shag-pads upstairs. Perfect spot for those nights you either overindulge and need a clean place to vomit or score the love of your life and need a place to ""talk"". 
Has the feel of a place that should charge by the hour, not the night. Dingy hallways with zero finish. Interesting cross between cell block and horror movie set walking from elevator to room. 
This place is the perfect storm of NYC cliche:
1. Paper thin walls that allowed me to learn 25 new Russian swear words between 0400 and 0630 on a Sat morning. 
2. Plumbing installed by the first Dutch settlers. 
3. Located next to a firehouse so you could track every move of the bravest men in the country ALL NIGHT. 
4. Majestic courtyard where the accoustics allow you to participate in conversations 23 floors below.

"“Small room but great hip location” This is a hip place to stay...there always seems to be something going on. The night club can get really crazy and there is always some fun people watching. I have stayed here many times and it is nice. The best part is that you are centrally located but not stuck in the craziness of Times Square. And if you want to walk to Times Square you can be there in 5 minutes...not bad and then once you get to Times Square you will wish you were back at the Hudson. There is a great rooftop bar...drinks are pricey...my Martini was 20 bucks after a tip but it was good! The sunset was great from up there. The restaurant has amazing Mac and Cheese too. Now to save some money for dinner and drinks just walk around the corner and you will find a ton of places. We found some great Happy Hours too...$10 Martini's...buy one get one free! What! Now we are talking! 
On the bad side the rooms are small...but hey this is New York. What do you expect? And it is so dark too...after a week here you start to feel like a vampire living in a cave and you just want to know what you look like...but hey vampires are hip right now...so that could be a selling point for the hotel. 
I've flown in early and a room has always been available for me. I have been very lucky. Also, I've upgraded my room to a Queen for only $15 a night. Not a bad up charge if you ask me. 
Staff is super friendly and are always protecting me from the Europeans that stay here. It is really annoying but when you are at the front desk...the Europeans will walk right up and stand on your back while you are checking in or trying to pay your bill. The Hudson Staff always comes to my rescue by asking them, ""Excuse me are you with this gentleman?"" After they say, ""No!""

Although, if we were the type to spend a lot of time in our hotel room, maybe we would have been diasappointed. But come on folks, it's New York City! The public areas of the hotel (the private park and the Sky Terrace) and Central Park a block away are where we spent most of our time, and the location couldn't be beat for the price! My daughter actually wants me to bring her back for her Sweet 16 this spring, and I'm seriously considering it!

When we checked in we informed the staff that we were on our honeymoon - the girl was lovely, offered us her congratulations and an upgrade of our room!
Our suite was also very nice - not huge, but with two double rooms more than big enough for two of us! We ate in the hotel 'canteen' that night and had a great experience - lovely food and very novel way of ordering! On our return to our room we were delighted to find that Sabrina who had checked us in had sent us a bottle of champagne and two tokens for breakfast the next morning with the hotel's compliments. It was a very sweet gesture and hugely appreciated.
The location of the hotel was perfect for us, we managed to walk to most places and when we got tired it was usually around $5 cab fare to wherever we were going or coming from.

"“Great location but not a serene stay” Yes, it's trendy, yes it's cool. But this building used to be an office building and the rooms are still like cubicles. The size of the rooms (tiny) wasn't even so bad as the proximity and total auditory access to neighboring rooms. 
The first night I was rudely awakened by a loud (drunk?) couple coming in, late. Maybe 2 or 3am. I could hear every single word they yelled at each other. And I had a very early wakeup call the next morning for a work breakfast. Augh!
The next day I was resting at around 3pm (since I hadn't slept well) and the room on the OTHER side started up. This time it was loud music and even louder, and I mean screamingly loud, sex. It sounded like they were in my room! I have never felt so uncomfortable. So I went downstairs to talk about it with the front desk and she was very apologetic and she did move me to a different room, facing the Atrium which she said would be quieter.

However once in there is a very trendy reception and the bars have neon lights and a pool table...Unfortunately its pricey to eat/drink there so we never did,
The room I was warned about but still expected to be able to sit on the loo...the bathroom was so tiny you had to perch at an angle on the loo! The bed was very low about 
6 inches from the floor, but comfy. you could shuffle across the base of the bed sideways as there was about a foot gap to the wall so rubbish rooms, The location seemed okay, just a couple of irish bars walking distance. The lighting in the hotel was too dark, you could not see the lift floors because the lift was too dark which annoyed!
I had an extra visitor of a large mouse in my room and to be fair the reception were excellent at getting me moved straightaway to an upgraded suite, however their idea of a suite is UK' s idea of a hotel room ...

"“Can't wait to go back!!!” I have just come back from a wonderful 5 night stay in New York at the Hudson Hotel. My boyfriend and I went to New York to celebrate our 8 year anniversary. We unfortunately had a bad start to our trip when our first flight was cancelled but it luckily only delayed us by seven hours. 
As soon as we arrived at the Hudson, we were greeted by the attentive bellman who immediately took our suitcases to be sent up to our room. The front desk staff were very friendly and wished us ""happy anniversary"" upon arrival which was a lovely touch! :) We were very happy to find that we had been upgraded to a junior suite. Our room was modern and spacious. To my surprise, Shacazia the Guest Experience Manager had personally put a bottle of champagne in the room with a note. We were lucky to meet her the next day; she was just as nice in person and made us feel very welcome during our entire stay. 
I had been in contact with the Hotel prior to our stay to ask for their advice with restaurant bookings and tours etc. Anastasia & Kate from the concierge were a delight to communicate with and willingly booked everything I asked. 
The hotel was in a great location, only a few minutes walk away from Central Park! 
My boyfriend used the gym every day and business centre a couple of times and said they were both ideal to use for a short stay. We ordered room service a couple of times for breakfast and although we found it to be expensive, the staff were very accomodating.

"“Horrible Hotel - DON'T STAY HERE” I would advise anyone visiting NYC to NOT stay at this hotel. List of reasons why:
Hotel is a knockoff of a W hotel. It is like staying in a bad dance club. Front desk, outdoor park, lobby area, hallways are all dark with no lighting. The walls of the hallway are painted black and the carpet is dark with stains and dirt everywhere. Pot and cigarette smoke on one floor...smell of meatloaf on another floor. 
The rooms are tiny - even for NYC standards. Can't even sit on the toilet straight because the wall is so close.
Front Desk Staff - unhelpful, unfriendly, not too bright. 
No safe in our room, had to change rooms after asking to speak to a manager.
$16 dollar drinks in the bar.
No air conditioning in the lobby, elevators or hallways. Very hot in the summer.
Entrance is on ground floor, lobby is on 2nd floor so you have to go up an escalator to get to the lobby/front desk...which isn't a problem unless you have luggage. You can get to an elevator by going through a roped off area and bell stand.
I got a good rate on hotels.com which was about half the rate on the hotel's website. It still wasn't worth that price!

"“Bird cage + awful service. Advice: find another hotel” The hotel owners apparently tried to save in every possible way. The room is very small and the design is really weird. The hotel doesn't provide even the duvet and instead you get the blanket stuck between two bed sheets. Also, imagine that there is a transparent wall between the bathroom and living area. Our room was dusty and the bath was covered with someone's hairs. 
The service is the worst. Since this hotel has a good location, these guys get enough traffic. They do not care about your complaints and requests. We stayed in this place 3 days. As soon as we got there, we saw that our bath tub was broken. The water was not draining. Although we asked to repair the tub, none put any attention on our request. We asked several times...3 days - nothing was done.
The room service is crazy. They hardly knock...If you are sleeping, they keep on coming back every half an hour. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn't provide ""don't disturb"" tags. I strongly suggest you to make one.",Anna888_11,2011-07-01,223023,2011-07-05,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Fantastic hotel if you do your homework in advance” We spent a 6 night stay at the Hudson Hotel in New York at the end of May 2011 and had a fantastic time. There are a few tips and tricks to be aware of when booking which I will detail below but here's an overview of the hotel.
Hudson Hotel is a trendy modern hotel which although is a bit on the under-lit side is very atmospheric and cool. The reception staff were very friendly and efficient at both check-in and check-out. The concierge next to reception was very helpful and answered all of our questions and helped us when booking transportation to the airport. The hotel also offered complimentary bag storage when we wanted to go and do some sightseeing on our last day after we had checked out. The hotel is very close to a main subway junction (Columbus Circle) meaning it is very easy to get around the city. It is also near to Central Park which is an added bonus.
There is a pool table in the library which is free for guests to use, plus there are plenty of comfy sofas and armchairs and a couple of chess sets. We didn't go to the bars or restaurant but did make use of the Sky Terrace on the 15th floor which was a great place to have breakfast in the morning or chill out in the evening after a hard days sightseeing. The hotel has a well equipped gym but no swimming pool despite what you might read elsewhere.
Our superior queen room was a good size (not huge but in keeping with every other major city I've been to). It was cleaned and tidied daily and the bed was remade which was great to come back to in the evenings, plus there was a hairdryer and shower amenities which were restocked each day. There were no tea and coffee making facilities which was disappointing but the TV and stereo CD player worked well. There was also an ice dispenser on each floor which was useful. The room was fully air conditioned which kept it nice and cool despite the 30 degree heat outside.
I would highly recommend this hotel but would ask people to bear a few things in mind before booking;
- Don’t book a standard room, but rather go for a superior or deluxe room (the cost is a little higher but you'll be glad of it when you get there!). We were in a superior queen which was a perfect size for 2 people of average height.
- Request a room on the highest floor possible in the hotel (floors 19-24 are best - we were on the 23rd floor), so as to be as far away from the street noise and music from the bars downstairs.
- Email the hotel in advance to request a room on the highest floor possible - DO NOT bother with the main email webform via the Morgans Hotel Group website (we got no reply), instead try the Hudson Hotel manager Fady Awad at fady.awad@morganshotelgroup.com - he was very helpful.
- Book online via the Hudson Hotel website directly rather than using a third party company as these companies select the cheapest standard rooms which are very small (hence the number of negative reviews on the Trip Advisor website). We managed to get 20% off the room price online as a special deal if we paid upfront. This made the check-in and check-out much quicker too.
If you follow this advice you are more likely to have a pleasant stay at the Hudson Hotel. In conclusion the Hudson Hotel is a great location to stay in New York as long as you do a little preparation before you travel.",MarkDaniell,2011-05-01,223023,2011-07-05,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Don't do it!” Booked a twin-bedded room - very specific as it was for my son and I. Politely told one was not available but they would upgrade us to a deluxe room and WE would have to pay an additional fee for a roll-up bed. Not happy, so asked for the Manager, who could only be described as obnoxious. Room was NOT upgraded and was small and dingy. No roll-up bed was provided although I literally pestered them for hours for one (although when we checked out they tried to charge us 50 odd dollars for it!). Lock on the door didn't work and the safety chain was literally falling off the door. The fact that anyone could walk in to our room and help themselves, together with the noise from the bar area meant two sleepless nights and the spoiling of our stay in New York.

"“Great, funky hotel, quiet area, good location...” We live on Long Island and LOVE our ""escapes"" to the city. The hotel is located in a quiet spot not directly in the ""craziness"" of Times Square but still walkable if you like to walk the city. Beautiful outdoor bar. Rooms were clean and cozy. Stayed with our two young children (3 & 8). They loved it too. You won't find it overly accommodating for children (i.e. welcome gifts, kids activities, etc.) yet they will certainly not be unwelcome either.

"“Lots of great places to hang out at Hotel, but rooms themselves...meh..” We'd been to the bar at the Hudson before but never stayed there; but we got a chance to in July. 
The hotel lobby is beautiful, really well decorated. The Hudson Bar on the same floor is also well setup, with lighted floors and really cool furniture. Great place to have drinks at night. Even the quieter ""library"" bar has a nice atmosphere, and you can go into the outside courtyard and enjoy some drinks; it was a nice day and we sat out there for awhile. There is also a terrace on the 15h floor which is great to hang out. So as far as things to do at the hotel, you can't really beat the Hudson.
Now as far as the rooms go, oh boy....we had a regular room which was the lowest according to the prices. This room is tiny...yes, I know about NYC hotels and been to dozens, but this is TINY. We could deal with that, but in the end, for a fancy hotel like the Hudson, it just seemed kind of badly put together.
There was only one electrical outlet on one side of the bed, not the other. The small flat screen TV is hanged on the wall and next to the bed; if you're on the side of the bed closest to the TV you can't even see the screen. The bathroom has one of those glass walls where you can see a person taking a shower, which a lot of boutique hotels have a we always like that touch. Problem is...the toilet is right there too b/c the bathroom is so small...kind of awkward. The A/C unit is directly behind the bed, so it's either freezing or warm. The closest is tiny. It was just a pretty frustrating experience as far as the room went. Mind you we did book the ""standard"" room, so maybe if you upgrade to a suite you'll have a much more enjoyable experience.
Overall, I would for sure check this place out and see the bars, etc, but skip the stay here. It's not that bad, but for the price you can find better in NYC.",Richiana,2011-07-01,223023,2011-07-03,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Decent stay for the price” I was a bit apprehensive reading all the bad reviews on Tripadvisor as I normally check a lot of reviews before I actually go staying at some place. To my surprise, I had absolutely no problems staying at the Hudsons. We were there for about 5 days and it quickly became home after a long day walking the streets of New York or biking @ Central Park. Id say that the other reviews are in the right directon - excellent location and cramped rooms. if you asked me to sum it up. The rooms are the tiniest rooms that I have seen of any hotel anywhere in the world, but we had gone in as a couple so did not feel that the cramped rooms were much of an issue (if you know what I mean ;)). The toilets and bath are just shielded using curtains and so it might be uncomfortable if you are staying with a person you aren't comfortable sharing everything with. The staff was very quite friendly, and we also took bikes from the hotel (complimentary) to ride @ Central park. The other positives were that a. we did not feel disturbed at all (both in terms of noise and/or people knocking or calling - just the way we wanted it to be). b. The room was clean (incl the bath). Also had to get a suit pressed at the last minute on a Sunday night. Though they charged $23, it was worth the emergency service! I booked the hotel through Priceline so got a good deal as well.

"“Worst Hotel we have ever stay at in 60 years of world traveling” Delta Airlines recommended this ""hostel ""and we were taken in by the alleged 4 star rating. The only stars my husband saw is when he bashed his head on the television which hung over the bed 11x11 sized room comparable to a prison cell. I had to scurry around in the halls looking for ice to stop his profuse bleeding from his scalp at 3 in the morning. No ventilation; no fan in bathroom that worked; sink leaked and had to use a waste basket to collect water. No privacy between bathroom and bed area just a transparent sheer fabric; no place to unpack luggage; the only desk light in room didn't work; noise from airconditioner made sleeping impossible because it was situated directly behind headboard. The ""restaurant"" was really nothing more than a very expensive automat. The staff was unhelpful, rude and nasty especially the gal that was on duty the night we checked in. Our suspicions should have been aroused when we saw no marquee over the entrance naming the hotel where produce and garbarge were brought in and out. Also, we saw workmen in the service elevator wearing masks to avoid inhaling noxious dangerous fumes while they were repairing parts of the hotel so they told us when we queried them. We filed an incident report which turned out to be a mockery. Their insurance company, Zurich North America doesn't dignify legitimate complaints. Stay at your own risk.

"“Amateur Hour at Faded Hipster Haven: Never Again” I have done a number of reviews at this site and this is the first hotel I would label ""unacceptable."" Maybe this place was cool when it opened but it's definitely on life support now. The worst part was the morning elevator service. Tiny elevators creaked along during ""rush hour""--around 8:30, jammed with people and luggage, with absolutely no room for anyone else. So a parade of us, literally dozens of people, walked down 6 or 7 flights of dreary fire stairwells to the lobby just to be able to escape the hotel. What on earth would you do if you were elderly or handicapped? That was the worst, but there's more. I searched in vain for a minibar and called to ask if there was one. ""We can install one for $25"" (!). I phoned downstairs for a wake-up call--but hung up after about 50 rings. The water from the shower was a medium to dark brown color. I felt as if I were in my own scene from Psycho. Shower tiles were chipped and stained. A coffee and a bagel in the morning? With the outrageous per item prices, services charges, delivery charges, etc. etc. it cost about the same as a restaurant dinner with wine. I gave up and walked to the corner deli for a bagel, banana and coffee for under three bucks--back in the room in 5 minutes. (But then of course that was before elevator rush hour). The final insult was the check out: one person handling the angry mob trying to get out of this disaster zone. The young ""hipper than thou"" staff seemed more confused than concerned about the tirade of complaints coming from the prisoners--sorry ""guests."" Was there anything good? Yes, the location is convenient to the newish Columbus Circle mall, the 59th street subway lines, 57th street shopping and dining and Central Park. The cloth ""pull light"" on the bed was nifty once I figured it out. There is a noisy hipster party scene in the lobby that might appeal to some. But, as a former New Yorker who has stayed at some fine hotels in the City at various price ranges--this one falls under the category ""never again.""",Kenat323,2010-12-01,223023,2011-01-20,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Enjoyable stay in modern and well situated hotel” I had some reservations about staying in this hotel prior to arrival, due to reading some pretty negative reviews on here.
However, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and the hotel surpassed my expectations.
The exterior is very modern and unusual, as is the lobby decor, which was quite striking. Definitely made a positive change from the standard hotel experience. It was really warm in the Reception area which was lovely after coming in from the freezing NY weather! The staff were polite and attentive.
Our room was on the 10th floor which was far enough away from the Bar area to not be affected by any noise. In fact we weren't disturbed by any kind of noise throughout the whole stay, the walls must be well insulated as we were never aware of any other guests at all!
The room was well appointed with a lovely flatscreen TV with lots of channels. There was a huge mirror (which helped make the small space look bigger), and the best was really comfy and spacious (we had a Queen room). The window was quite drafty and was directly above the pillow area, so this was a bit unpleasant at times. However, there is an easy to use control system for heating and a/c which helped. There was also an electronic safe, very handy. The main problem with the room was the size of the bathroom, as has been reported on here- it was tiny! At first it was a bit of a shock, but it was fine to deal with, everything was clean and modern, and the shower was nice and powerful with good temperatures. We actually didn't end up finding the bathroom size an issue, as had thought we might. The see-through wall was a bit odd, and could have done without that!! Everything was clean and the domestic staff were efficient and unobtrusive. The lack of cupboard/wardrobe space was slightly annoying but I would say we definitely had enough floor space to not feel cramped. 
The location of the hotel was great, in one of the nicer neighbourhoods, we were virtually next door to the south west corner of Central Park, easily accessible to the great shopping areas in this vicinity, and a short walk from Times Square. We walked this route many times and in fact we only used taxis coming home at night, and when we went slightly further afield to the Financial district. Taxis were cheap and easy to come by.
Overall, we found the hotel to be very good value for money, obviously it was not the most luxurious of experiences (reflected in the price) but it was well situated, clean, modern, relaxing and an altogether enjoyable stay.",Squirrelio,2011-01-01,223023,2011-01-20,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great hotel!” I was a bit worried about arriving at this hotel from what the reviews have said. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a very stylish hotel. We stayed in a standard double room for 5 nights, which was lovely, although the bathroom was a tight squeeze, it suited us both, there is plenty of room for two people to move around in.

"“NOT a biz hotel - should not be in Hotwire” This is a very hip hotel with an amazing ambience for the right guest. But biz travellers and road warriors beware - you can't work or sleep here! I stayed in both a 450 sq ft suite and 150 sq ft single on the same trip - so I can comment on BOTH ends of the Hudson spectrum. The suite was spacious and well appointed for work - complete with a printer and extra-long USB cable to plug into my laptop while still siting at the generously sized desk. Nice touch. The suite did lack any decent lighting - which sets a nice mood - but not if you're looking frantically for a dropped cufflink while late for a meeting!
The single room is useless for the biz traveller and should be avoided at all costs. Many reviews here will detail this problem - but the singles are simply unfit for a couple or even a single biz traveller. 
But worst is the pounding disco. If you need a god night's sleep before a key meeting - even being on the TWELFTH floor wasn't distance enough to shield my ears from the thumping of the main floor bars. I totally get that this is an ultra-hip boutique hotel for the trendy, in-crowd. But I had NO way of knowing this when reserving in Hotwire - so I was stuck staying at a hotel that was in NO way biz friendly unless you spring for a $$$$ suite.
So while it probably delivers excellent value and setting for the right guest, it isn't suitable for business travel and should therefore not be an available choice in Hotwire - or should come with some sort of disclaimer - stating that this is party-centric spot liklely to be pounding away all night long.",RallyguyTraveller,2011-01-01,223023,2011-01-17,False,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Good Location and Value - a comprehensive review” I stayed at the Hudson NYC for 5 nights towards between xmas and nye.
Location:
Right by 59th Street/Columbus Circle subway so it is easy to get anywhere from there once underground. There is a lot around the area and we ended up walking into Times Square a few times (maybe 15-20 minutes (?). There are plenty of places to eat in the area - classic diners, and deli's (Carnegies is an obvious choice!!).
All night supermarket and pharmacy (CVS) nearby.
In summary I found the location and proximity to the main central attractions an subway a draw card to stay at the Hudson.
Cost:
It cost me $1240 for the 5 nights - I did my research and that was BY FAR the cheapest I could find in the area, I was therefore sceptical but well worth it.
I booked through their website directly and went for one of their special deals.
The room type I got was the Kind Deluxe - see my description below about why I recommend going for the more expensive option.
>>This did not include breakfast.
Room:
Ok, it was small lets not kid but let that not deter you.
As a result of all the reviews I read on this site I went for the Deluxe King - which basically means there is about 1 meter space on each side of the king size bed. Trust me - it makes a difference! I saw the regular rooms and while the deluxe king is small the regular (queen) rooms are tiny.
So in terms of size the King Deluxe was more than adequate to store suitcases comfortably. Living your hotel room in NY is against moral law.
The room was very clean and modern, It had a flat screen TV (21'') with plenty of channels. (incl HD)
Bed was comfortable.
We were on the 7th floor. No real view.
Mini electronic safe.
Internet access is $10 per day.
Bathroom:
This was the only real downer - it was tiny: shower/toilet/sink in maybe 2 square meters.
Shower was great. If you are tall you might battle to sit on the toilet.
Another thing I wasnt mad about was that there is full length glass window in the shower with direct visibility to the bedroom - while is it covered from the inside with a shower curtain (plus one more shower curtain on the other side of the shower) if you don't like watching your partner take a dump then you might not like this feature.
That was the only real think I didnt like.
Hotel Facilities:
>Couple of bars - one with a pool table and tables fr boardgames like backgammon or chess - quite chilled. It is quite a popular bar so it can be noisy and busy but its a quality place.
>Restaurant - I think that is where they serve breakfast - but we didnt go there.
In summer they have a a bar on the 15th floor in the hotel - was not open in December.
>Luggage - we left luggage on the last day at the hotel - very good service and secure.
> Concierge - dedicated desk to answer all your questions.
Summary - 
I recommend the hotel. 
It was cheaper than anything else in the area. 
Location is good.

"“So incredibly dark and very noisy at night” When you arrive the lobby is really wow - large, spacious and funky design. The guy who checked me in gave me early access to my room which was much appreciated after a transatlantic flight. He was very nice and welcoming. 
The lobby is dimly lit which is ok but you soon discover the entire hotel is dimly lit, including your room. It's literally a problem to work in the room due to the poor lighting. When I was there the weather outside was beautiful and sunny but inside my room it felt like it was 8 o'clock at night. After 24 hrs it drove me nuts and I was just craving some light! 
The rooms are small but worse were some basic design flaws - a walkin wardrobe area with only a few hangers and no shelves or drawers so I ended up with all my clothes except suits in my suitcase as there was no where else to put them. Also not a single hook for a coat/belts/necklaces etc. 
There was a table/desk in the room but no plug near it so I had to charge my computer on the floor and then work using the battery which was very inconvenient. 
 The beds are very comfortable but several nights a week there is a very popular busy club in the hotel and it gets really noisy - so badly that it's hard to sleep, which I think is really not ok considering that this is not a cheap hotel.

"“oppressive rooms and poor staff attitude” We stayed at the Hudson over new year 2010 / 2011 for ten days. There been a huge concession made by the hotel in trying too hard to be trendy / cutting edge over customer service and attitude. We upgraded to a deluxe queen and were shocked to see what we got for our money. The rooms are tiny and not helped by dark wood wall cladding which brings the rooms in even further. The bathroom measure 2' x 5' max including the shower. The corridors are dirty and the carpet needs attention in many areas. If it wasnt for my interior designer wife explaining to me what the hotel was trying to achieve I would have dismissed it completely as a poorly designed, dirty hotel. 
On the good side - the room cleaners were incredibly polite and always left the room tidy. The Library Bar Staff were a different matter - this bar has limited seating and they allocate three areas with sofas for groups of seven or more!!! So on the evenings we used the library - couples couldnt sit down because their group wasnt large enough. Whilst three areas remained unused - ridiculous but the bar staff enforced the rule.
In summary - we wouldnt return to the Hudson even if it was free.",oodimo,2010-12-01,223023,2011-01-14,False,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Strange but good - at least locationwise” The location of the Hudson is quite good - just at the corner of Central park, and a few blocks from Fifth Avenue as well as Times Square. So locationwise, this is a good option. Pricewise however, I think you can do better. It is a bit steem in the pricing-department.
The hotel is also a bit ""over the top""-wannabe trendy. Combined entrance for hotel and club results in huge bodyguard-men guarding the doors at night - a bit over the top maybe? The rooms are small but clean and nice, but the reception area is really dark with weird decorations, and the business center is a in my mind close to a joke. 18 dollars for retrieving and printing an e-maildokument is just not so businesstraveller-friendly..

"“Expected Much more” I chose the Hudson based on the fact that friends advised that it was a trendy hotel. The best things about the hotel was the lobby. Its lavish, large and beautiful. When you step in, you know that you are in for a great stay. We checked in and the front desk attendant was slow and messed up our room keys. 
The room was nothing like the lobby. It was tiny. The smallest we had ever been in. The word that came to mind when we stepped in was cruise cabin. Very very cramped with wooden walls. The room could hardly hold the luggage that we had and the bathroom was hopelessly small. 
THe plus side is the location which was near to columbus circle and close enough to Fifth Ave. Stay here ONLY for the location, not for the room. If you stay for the room, you will be disappointed",mokah65,2011-01-01,223023,2011-01-05,False,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“3.5 star NYC hotel that smells like marijuana and has used towels in the bathroom” We checked in on NYE pretty late after a late night out. Upon arrival, we were told that the rooms were ""pre-determined"" and that there would be no choice of a room. Given our fatigue, we just wanted to get to bed ASAP. Upon getting off the floor, the hallways were dark and REEKED of marijuana (can you imagine if you brought your family here??!!). The room itself was tiny (as told by every review here). The bedsheets were a bit disorganized and a loud buzzing sound was present. We turned off the radiator thinking it was the culprit but to no avail. Our purpose was to sleep ASAP but all night the buzzing persisted. Suffice to say, we ""woke up"" pretty early on 1.1.11 and upon going to the bathroom we noted that the floor was wet and there were only USED TOWELS present. The toiletries were also used. After calling the front desk, the towels arrived after 15 minutes! Obviously, we wanted another room ASAP. That took a total of 6.5 hours!!! So from 9am to 330pm on 1.1.11 we had NO hotel room to stay in. We were given a different room but at this point our experience was grave and disappointing to say the least. Also, to get to the front desk, we were put on hold for 20 minutes. Overall, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. NYC has plenty of nice hotels with which to spend your hard-earned money. The only good thing re: this hotel is the bar area. This hotel needs a change in management and needs to get its priorities straight ASAP.

"“Trendy lobby, expensive drinks and damn dark!” We were in New York for a week and we spent our first 2 nights here, at The Hudson.
There's no doubt it's an impressive place on arrival, a neon lit escalator ascends you toward the hotel lobby where check in was smooth and the reception staff were helpful.
Up to our room and having read some previous reviews, I anticipated it would be a bit compact - it was! Any more than a couple of nights and I think it would have been too much. 
Whatsmore the room was roasting hot - in December (!?) - so we had to run a rather noisy AC unit for a lot of the time
Later in the evening we made it down to the library bar for our first drink in NYC. I paid the bar tender $9 for a bottle of Heniken - plus tip! I'd expected NYC might be expensive but wow!
My other observation would be the lighting. Dark and moody is great but sometimes I enjoy the luxury of actually seeing what I'm doing and in the Hudson that's nigh on impossible. Whether you're in your own room or the hotel bar or lobby - during the day or the night - it's practically impossible to see a thing and by the time we left it had began to irritate me.
In summation, I'm pleased we went. Location wise it's dead handy for central park and some of the other tourist attractions and it's an experience worth having.

"“Disappointing -- not worth the money” This is a very swank hotel that is, unfortunately, not worth the exorbitant price. 
To start with, the rooms are small. But I was expecting this, and the rooms were not smaller than rooms in Rome or Tokyo or Paris, or many other hotels in NYC for that matter.
My chief complaint was the bed: absolutely awful (hard and low). You would expect at a ""luxury"" hotel like this, at least the beds would be comfortable, but both my wife and I had back pain in the morning.
Moreover, the room was noisy. We were on the 12th floor and still heard noise from t he street. Inexcusably, we also heard people talking on the phone in the next room, as well as people walking by in the hall.
The issues above are very disappointing, since the overall experience when checking in makes you feel like you will be treated like a movie star. But no matter how good the lobby, the rooms need to be up to par...
On the positive side, the location is good and the service was friendly.

"“MONEY TAKEN OUT OF ACCOUNT WITHOUT AUTHORISATION!” This was our first trip to the US and especially for us. Visiting New York has been a long time dream for us and we knew this was going to be a special trip for us.
The hotel at first instance seemed dark and gloomy but we soon got used to the dim atmosphere. Upon arrival we were asked to provide a credit card for guarantee room service purposes - which was usual for hotels to do. However, we later learned that £600 was taken out of our credit card without authorisation or notice for that matter! We had already paid for our room prior and did not spend such amount at the hotel so we were keen to find out why this was taken out our card without permission. We demanded to speak to the manager to give us an explanation, but what we really needed was that money back into the account as that was much of our spending money!
The manager was very accommodating and upgraded our SMALL room and gave us complementary free drinks, which was very lovely as our initial room did not even fit two big suitcases comfortably. Monies were eventually transferred back into our account after a few days but it did cause disruptions to our holiday tremendously.
The hotel is located next to Central Park but I do recommend a hotel near Times Square as this is where we spent most of our time.
The staff were friendly and the security men at the entrance of the hotel were very helpful and polite.

Each time we called (at least 7 times over two days)we were told someone would be right up. No one ever appeared.

"“Great hotel, great price, would stay there again!” This hotel has been getting a bad rap, but it doesn't deserve it. I just returned from a four-night stay at Hudson and they were very accomodating. You just need to do your homework when evaluating a hotel and you should be fine. You should know going into this hotel that the rooms are tiny. The bathrooms are very tiny. If you know this in advance, that should help with not being disappointed. On their website, they show a photo of the room, and that photo is the whole room by the way, and they give the square footage, so there should be no surprises. If you make your reservation online, just call the hotel directly a day or two in advance to confirm your reservation and any special requests. Again, there should be no surprises if you do your homework. It's just common sense. 
The room was clean, but the bed in my room was extremely hard, so after the first night, I asked to be moved to another room for the last 3 nights of my stay. They did move me. The new bed was excellent. I was closer to the 15th-floor rooftop lounge music, but other than one night when the music played until late, it was really quiet. Even that night wasn't too bad as the air conditioner covered up much of the noise.
To sum it up, this is a great hotel. They offer some excellent deals on their website. If you don't mind a tiny room and bathroom - and most people don't go to New York to spend time in their hotel rooms except to sleep - then this hotel is worth the money. Just do your homework and go into this hotel knowing what to expect, and you should enjoy yourself. Hudson doesn't deserve the bad rap it has been getting on this website. Be realistic with your expectations. It is a different and unique hotel. Definitely worth checking out. And it's within walking distance to Times Square and the The Theatre District.

Besides a few scratches on the floor and some dings on the wall, the room was well maintained. Our cost was a bit less than $200 a night for two people in one bed. Many of the rooms do not have very good views (see photos). A glass of their house wine and their “cheap” champagne cost $40 (after tip) at the lobby bar!!!

"“Disappointed” I lived in NYC for 12 years and know the city very well. I live in Europe now and just went back to NYC for the holidays and decided to stay at the Hudson based on the fact that it's a nice boutique hotel with excellent deals from time to time and I have stayed at the Morgan's Clift Hotel in San Francisco which I found excellent. The rate I found of $199.00 per night was unbeatable for Christmas and we were given a free upgrade. I booked directly through the hotel and learned that you have to ask for the deals since they are not allowed to mention them first. There were a few things that I found disappointing with the Hudson, the first being that there is no clothing storage in most of the rooms, meaning you are likely going to have to live out of your bag for the duration of your stay and possibly wait two hours for extra hangers, which is what happened to me (they seemed understaffed). We were there during the blizzard and our room wasn't made up one day which is understandable since some of the staff probably didn't make it to the hotel. That being said, it would have been appropriate for the hotel to note the reason for the lapse in service. For all I know, they never make up your room the night before you check out. Lastly the restaurant in the hotel has hit rock bottom. I remember years ago there was a full service restaurant that had excellent food. Now it's a self-serve overpriced cafeteria that would have been packed on a blizzardy night in NYC if it wasn't so bad. Apparently most of the guests of the hotel agreed and decided to trudge through the snow instead. I would like to point out that this hotel is not worth full price and if you get a great deal like we did then try to get a room upgrade and go for it because at least it's clean and doesn't seem to have a bed bug problem like many other hotels in NYC. If you expect more than the experience I had do what I will do next time and cough up the extra cash and stay at the Gansevoort, The Thompson or the Soho Grand.",SLK1000,2010-12-01,223023,2010-12-31,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Sigh... disappointed” Our room was not ready. Was ok with waiting as our room was on the 23rd floor and we wanted a room on one of the ""higher"" floors due to noise concerns. The front desk attendant told us they would keep our luggage for us when readying the room and would deliver it to our room when we got back. They Subsequently gave our room to someone else who had complained about their room, and gave us their crappy one.
Plaster peeling off of ceiling, dirty walls. Air conditioner smelled horrible. Towels were used and maintenance men kept knocking on the door as a result of previous occupants room complaints. We bid on Price Line and were forced to upgrade before arriving, resulting in higher bill for one week stay than had I paid full price elsewhere for a 4 star hotel (Times Square)
Not happy. Had a seven night reservation and was forced to stay as I had paid through Priceline (no refunds), and another hold for the additional charges for the required Hudson Hotel room ""upgrade"" on my credit card.

"“Nightclub with bedrooms attached” The Hudson has a funky reputation however it is so busy being cool that it has forgotten that it has to function as a hotel. The rooms are so small, let me say that again, they are comically, ridiculously small. I smashed my head in the flatscreen many times in the week, when getting out of bed. My knees touched the walls, when sitting on the toilet. I am 5'11"" tall. The room has no kettle, which is not problem as they will bring boiling water for $5.
When you are in a nightclub you would expect to pay a premium for drinks, $16 for a Black Label at any time. New York has too many fantastic restaurants to eat in the hotel, so I have not rated the restaurant. Fair is fair.
Also the entire hotel is as near to pitch black as possible, you literally can't see 5 feet in front because the lights are so low.
The outdoor patio is lovely and a great place to chill even if you can't get the wifi to work. The bar inside is about as funky as it gets. Friday and Saturday nights are the big nights. Another word of warning, the patio club will be blasting music until 11-12 every night. So don't expect any quiet before these times.
This place is great for jet set clubbers (I used to be one). We did get a decent price, however you can get more space, better service and just as good location minus the funky for the same money elsewhere.

"“An Awesome 20th Wedding Anniversary” My husband and I stayed at The Hudson Hotel December 14, 2010 through December 18, 2010. We were there celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. 
We checked in around 8:00pm on Tuesday night and were warmly greeted by the reception staff. I requested an upgrade but was told there were no room upgrades available but that there was a room available with a queen bed. We were pleasantly surprised and agreed.
The room wasn’t quite as big as a closet, but would have been adequate had the heating system not been so LOUD. It was 22 degrees in NYC and the heat came on often. So often, that it was difficult to get a good night’s sleep. It would come on and then ping ping ping ping ping for twenty minutes or so. We also had issues with the television and that is why we called the front desk first off. Front desk advised us that they would send a technician up so we waited and waited for the technician to show up. We tired of this and decided to go out. Returned a couple of hours later expecting our issues to be resolved, but no such luck!
Call one to the management at that time got me a voice mailbox (Michael). Call two, 45 minutes to an hour later, got me another voice mail box (Christopher). I left messages each time for a return call. Finally, about two hours later a very knowledgable tech came to our room checked the heat and basically told us there was nothing he could do, even with the tv. He did what he could, acted like he cared and asked us to let the Guest rep know of our experience the following morning. 
The following morning, I had not received a return call from either of the voice mail messages left for management the night before, so my husband and I contacted the concierge, who introduced us to Shacazia Brown, the Regional Guest Experience Manager. We explained our experience to her, she was sympathetic, apologetic and assured us that she would make it right. WOW! Did she ever! My husband and I returned later that day to an unbelievable room. Shacazia had our luggage brought up to the new room. It was AMAZING and surpassed any accommodation that I could have imagined in NYC!

"“Not a business hotel, but it doesn't try to be. Comfortable for a sardine can.” Stayed here first full week in December when Christmas festivities in NYC were in full swing. The Hudson was not my first choice of hotel for a business trip as the rest of the city was booked out, so I ended up staying in a single room for a ridiculously expensive price. 
Pluses - Close to Columbus Circle/Central Park, metro station on the opposite end of the block, fantastic lobby and great bar, very helpful front desk staff, comfortable bed (no bedbugs or issues with pillows), helpful and friendly concierge, porters and taxi guys at the front door.
Minuses - The single rooms are tiny, it's pretty noisy (but it's NYC, so you have to expect it to a point) and with the number of people I heard in my 5 nights there asking to be moved for a number of reasons, there are some floors that are obviously in better condition than others. I stayed on the 11th floor and it was fine.
I feel sorry for the front desk staff at the Hudson, as they do a great job of providing a friendly service but are constantly having to bear the brunt of disgruntled guests' complaints because the infrastructure of the building is not up to scratch. 
Saying that I don't think I'd stay here again, probably because I'd be here for business and this hotel doesn't really cater for that category of traveller. Plus, if you happened to get on a bad floor and had some of the issues that other travelers have had (which I did not), then I could see how you would feel you wouldn't be getting value for money at all. If you are looking for somewhere that has a good bar to chill in after a long day of sightseeing, and all you need is a bed, a bathroom and somewhere to leave your luggage, then the Hudson does the job just fine....you just need to get lucky and get on the right floor.",travisty11,2010-12-01,223023,2010-12-25,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Not a pleasant experience” When we checked in the front desk clerk indicated that they had a room for us, but we would have to move to be moved to another room the next night because ""they wanted us to have a higher room with a better view"" I knew that was a lie since we booked our room through priceline. I wondered what the real reason was. When we returned to get our new room assignment, we got our keys and went to the room but our luggage was not there. My wife went down to complain about the inconvenience of all this and to find out the real reason we were being moved. Evidently it was because the floor we were originally put on was in maintenance. That explained the filthy carpeting in the hallway. My wife said she didn't appreciate being lied to. All the front desk manager said was ""It's an inconvenience for us to"" After finally getting our luggage, we noticed that there was an unpleasant fishy smell coming from the heating vent. We called to inform the front desk about this. The sent a room houseman up to spray some air freshener in the vent. This masked the smell for a few minutes but as we were tired we went to bed with the smell of fish in the air. The next afternoon we asked to be moved yet again do to the smell and we did for the second time. Rooms are tiny, smaller than a cruise ship cabin and bathrooms even smaller. Not a pleasant stay.

"“The worst hotel I never had” Don't go and never think of stay.
I have been to NYC for a couple of times.
Attracted by the photos and designer works. Hence, I booked a room to stay.
When I got in the room, I decided to leave immediately.
It's so small that it even much smaller than those in Japan. I'm an Asian but I still find it difficult to turn.
The room is dirty and the pillows have bad smell.
Any worst point is that there are too many rooms and congested in a floor. There really may have a safety issue that I don't recomment to stay.
When I decided to leave, I have to pay for the room charges although I didn't stay. But no receipt can be provided until next day !!!

"“Great design, great location, nice staff -- but not a great sleep” We liked certain aspects of the hotel a lot: design, overall and the room interior, as well as the location. The staff were friendly and attentive, no problem there at all.
However - the reason we are probably not going to come back is the discomfort we experienced at night: very, very noisy heating unit would clunk and bang every time it went on and the fan was very loud. Also the window didn't close properly and was not isolated well which resulted in a very cold draft blowing over the bed. It's such a pity, because otherwise this hotel is really good value for the rate we paid.
The rooms are indeed small and the hallways very dark but we didn't mind that at all, as everything in the room was designed to be functional. There is no closet, just some hangers and shelves but for a short stay that is not a problem. The bathroom could use additional shelving by the sink but, again, we found a way around that.
Were in not for the difficulties with the heating unit, we would have really enjoyed our stay.",omuletu,2010-12-01,223023,2010-12-21,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,3.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great stay at a fun hotel!” We chose the Hudson because it offered a reasonable price at a good location--Columbus Circle across from the Time Warner building with parking right there.

The service was very good--we asked to change rooms because of noise and were immediately accommodated with a quiet slightly larger room. Personnel were helpful throughout the weekend.

"“Unique hotel with fantastic customer service and prime location.” We stayed one night at the Hudson in a Superior Queen room the first weekend in December. The reason for our trip was to have dinner in the city and to visit Rockefellar Plaza and other holiday activities. Picked the Hudson based on the recommendations of a few friends and its location. 
Rooms: As others have said, the rooms are SMALL!!! That's absolutely true, but we weren't going to NYC to spend time in the room. However, I THOUGHT that getting the next level double would have given us some more space which it did not. The room was definately small, you had to side step along the bottom of the bed to get to the desk and bathroom, but they made up for the limited space with unique design and eclectic touches. We never unpacked because of our short stay, so the lack of storage wasn't an issue for us. Our room had space to hang items and a few small cube shelves. The bathroom was small and outdated (shower), but it was clean and served us well. The bed was FABULOUS and we slept well after a long day out walking.
Staff: The staff at The Hudson are fantastic. They make it a point to ask you about yourself and offer any assistance they can. Everyone we spoke to, from check in to the porters out front (even in the frigid weather!) were very accomodating and friendly. 
Location: We walked EVERYWHERE during our visit, which was a major plus. If you're fit and like to walk, you can get all over the city. The hotel is easily accessible from Central Park, Rockefellar Plaza, shopping along 5th Ave, Times Square, etc.
We didn't use any of the restaurants or clubs in the hotel, so I can't comment on those.
If you're driving into the city, take advantage of the parking/room package and ask for late checkout. It was great not to worry about parking during our trip, just dropped off and picked up curbside.
There's a great little deli, I think it's called EuroPan, on the corner that has great coffee and fast breakfast. Just walk out the front doors and turn left to grab a quick drink/snack at a reasonable price before heading out for the day.",GreetingsFromPhilly,2010-12-01,223023,2010-12-17,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Not bad hotel, mean nasty security staff” Stayed here one night midweek attracted by location and the nightlife happening right in the hotel. Thought it'd be a relaxing overnight trip. Went out to have dinner downstairs and had a good meal. Then stoppoed over to the Hudson Hotel Library and there was a large black security guard who very rudely demanded I should sho my ID. I had left my wallet upstairs but had my room info., etc. But that didn't matter to this guy. He acted like I was a criminal so naturally I was a bit annoyed. I'm 55 years old, for heaven's sake. I told him I would go up to get the ID but again, he snorted at me like I was insane and told me not to bother. I called him a jerk and stormed off and within three minutes, three security guards came over and apprehended me as thought I'd done something terribly wrong. They demanded to know who I was, show my ID, and leave since they called me a ""security risk."" When I showed them my room key, they apologized and let me go, but why in the world would these people behave like this? I will never stay in this hotel again. I wanted to ask for my money back but I didn't have the energy. Meanwhile, I went out to another bar and spent $50 there.

"“Great location, clean, frienly staff” I ended up here through a Priceline bid and I was satisfied with my stay. Even though I am not accustomed to paying NYC prices it turned out to be a deal.

Room and bathroom are small like a cruise ship, very clean, and a very comfortable bed. I originally had a double but the great lady on the front desk upgraded us to a queen facing the courtyard and the street noise wasn't too bad. The head of the bed is under the window and air/heating unit and leaks cold air onto your head at night. The rooms are dark and not well lit because of the art-deco style. Overlooking a few of these things it was a great location, friendly staff, and walking distance to Columbus Circle, subway station, Central Park, Theater District, restaurants, and Times Square.

"“Still in shock” I stayed at the Hudson for my birthday. I traveled alone, and good thing I did because the room was barely big enough for me. I actually started laughing when I walked in. Wow, I didn't think it was even possible to construct a room that small. The bed is 8 inches from the floor, and the walls are literally about a foot from the bed on each side. So picture this, I'm 6'0, and sitting on the bed my knees were around my ears - and anytime I stood up from the bed my chest was to the wall. I brought 2 pieces of luggage with me, and they were in the way. There was no place to put them. The bathroom was a joke. I had to sit on the toilet sideways because I couldn't fit the normal way. I tried to spend as much time as possible out of the room due to feeling claustrophobic. If you plan on staying at this hotel, be sure to carry a small flashlight - you'll need it to navigate the dark hallways. The one bright side was the nightclub - it was very happening. Other than that, i think the only person that could be comfortable in the small rooms is a contortionist.

"“Hudson = Letdown!! ALOT BETTER PLACES TO STAY IN NYC FOR THAT PRICE” I took several of my family members to the Hudson at the end of November. Being 22 and having previously stayed at the Hudson I thought it would be a good all-round hotel to take my family to for their first time in NYC.
Having stayed at the Hudson back in April and booking a Deluxe King I was pretty sure that it would be a good idea to book those types of room again as I had heard the standard rooms are tiny.
Having arrived after a 5 hour delay at 5am and being told that we couldn't check in until 3pm even though we had booked the hotel from the night before was the first sign of the careless reception staff.
When we arrived into the rooms they were 1/3 of the size that i had a few months previous! Once we questioned this with the hotel they were insistent that the rooms were the same size as a few month previous. After a frank discussion we were eventually all moved to larger rooms the next morning.
One of the rooms originally also smelt of sewage & had a door that no matter how hard you slammed wouldn't shut.
One of our party had a new room every night as the lock broke on the door the second night and took 90 minutes to gain entry to their room! We were informed that this was a problem that would be fixed during the daytime. It appears that the Hudson didn't bother to do this! Thanks to there carelessness we were late for dinner reservations.
When we went for a drink at the bar I was told that there weren't any tables available, after i expressed to the waitress my disappointment with the Hudson and how it had been let down after let down since we arrived a table soon appeared.
When leaving the hudson the luggage was put into a taxi for us, upon arrival at JFK one of the bags was left behind because the porters had forgotten to put a tag on it at the hotel!! Luckily we arrived 3 hours before our flight so they had time to get it to the airport for us.
Im a great fan of the Morgans group and regularly stay at the Shore Club Miami & Mondrian in LA but feel that the Hudson is really letting the group down!!
Its a hotel where the public areas are great but its rooms and attitudes of some staff are in great need of refurbishment and for that price range in NYC you can stay at hotels which do live up to the brand that they are representing!!!!",tsuth,2010-11-01,223023,2010-12-13,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hmmmm - not so good.” We booked via Hotwire, and paid a little over $300, versus the rack rate of over $450. We are a late 40's, early 50's lesbian couple from CT. We took a cab from Grand Central, which turned out good, because there is no marking on the exterior that lets you know it is a hotel, much less the Hudson. The check-in was great - nice young man, and we were able to get into our room even though it was only 10:30am. Once in the room, though, I can see how they can turn them around quickly - I've never been in a smaller room. The bed was a ""queen"" platform bed with no box springs - and sleeps like a rock. The bathroom is so small that my knees almost touched the wall when sitting on the toilet. The hotel was very hot, and the lights are dim everywhere. I suppose it's an ambiance thing - but just not that interesting to us. We were going to have breakfast in the hotel - it looks like a medieval dining hall, with long tables and bench seating - head of table has nice big chair. Tables are shared with others, and you have to go get your own breakfast. For a $28 continental breakfast (or you could ask for a la carte items - separately priced), I'd like to be served. We were also asked to pour our Starbucks into their mug, because ""we don't like that here."" So, given the snotty attitude, high price, extreme hot temperature of the room, and the self-serve, we didn't stay. We'll never go back.

"“Ugh, another Morgan money-grabber...” Stayed here for my birthday trip back to NYC, I think we got a deal online but not really since we could barely sleep. Between the loud clanking from the pipes (relieving pressure buildup every 20 minutes ALL night) and the loud, rude guests in the hallway, it was a bad experience. Not much could be done about either, though we did get a ""free upgrade"" for next time we stay at Hudson.
Anyhow, just like the Shore Club, this Morgan hotel tries to get hip yuppies to stay but focuses on its bar and lounge and pool areas not customer service or an actual hotel sleeping experience. small room, no space to do anything, seemed like I was in a typical Tokyo hotel room layout....

"“Nice Lobby - Horrible Rooms” The hotel lobby and common areas such as the bars are very trendy and good looking. The night life seemed best on the Thursday we arrived but was still crowded Friday and Saturday. The staff was pleasant and appeared to be helpful. However, that is where the positive aspects stop.
The hallway was a modernist prison of gray floors, walls, and ceilings. The hall sometimes smelled of marijuana and had vomit piles two of the three days.
We were initially booked into a standard room, which barely had eight inches of clearance on each side of the bed. While this is New York, it is also supposed to be a higher end hotel, so we were disappointed in the size. We paid to upgrade to a deluxe room. The first room's hardwood floor was warped, apparently from water damage. There was only one power outlet in the entire room (excluding the one in the bathroom). The toilet also leaked from the basin. The staff was helpful in transferring us to an alternate room.
The alternate room had the worst mattress I have ever had the misfortune upon which to sleep. The platform was six inches from the floor, and the mattress had no life left to it. The springs creaked at the slightest movement, and it felt as if it was only half full of straw. We complained each day about the mattress causing us to have poor sleep. The staff seemed concerned but only offered to send up an additional comforter to place on the mattress.
It had its central light fixture missing, so the only light came from fluorescent back lit bed lamps. The temperature control did not function accurately, spewing heat and cool air simultaneously from different ends of the unit. We eventually had to turn off the unit entirely and choose descending temperatures over rising heat (it was in the 30s overnight).
The bathroom was small but passable for New York with the exception of the location of the mirror. It was small and adjacent to the corner, so it was impossible to stand in front of it while also raising your left arm. That meant drying hair and other activities needed to be done in the near-dark bedroom. The toilet was about the size of a dentist office rinse basin, so I elected to use the lobby toilets as often as possible.
The mattress and the hotel's unwillingness to switch it out or switch us to a room with a quality mattress were the two things that guarantee that I will never return to this hotel as a guest.",broncalo,2010-12-01,223023,2010-12-08,False,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“One of a kind, refreshingly unique” I admit I was a bit weary given some of the bad reviews but my stay at the Hudson was fantastic. The location can't be beat and given the proximity to residential west-side, we were able to find street parking the entire trip. Also, it's either a short walk or $5 cab ride to pretty much every tourist location in NY.
Having stayed at a Marriot the night before, I found the Hudson to be a nice change from the boring cookie cutter hotel I stay in 90% of the time. The staff were fantastic and the decor was modern and refreshing. Yes, the rooms are small, but we had no problem fitting 2 adults and 2 toddlers comfortably. Our only concern was the white sheets and our messy kids! The lobby is huge and inviting and if you don't want to relax in your room, there are plenty of areas to go. I can only imagine that when the weather is warmer and the terrace and private park are more inviting that the hotel has even more common areas to relax.
The negative reviews are unmerited.

"“Great location, but service has room for improvement” The Hudson Hotel is very well located, just across from the Time Warner Center's shops and a block from Central Park and Columbus Circle. The property is designed with a very modern look and feel, which seems a bit too dark for my taste but is still inviting and elegant. The rooms are closet-sized, though everything has been scaled down to fit comfortably. The service, however, could be substantially improved, particularly for business travelers. I waited nearly an hour in the Business Center to have someone come check the malfunctioning printer. When the person never showed up, and after five calls to the Front Desk, I was asked to go back down to the lobby to have the Concierge print my documents. Even worse, the 6am wake-up call that I requested never came, making me nearly miss my client meeting at another hotel.

I say that because the whole tone of the hotel is sort of ""loung-ey"" in the sense that the lighting in the hallways and elevators is dimmed and there is ""chill"" music playing all the time. Yes, the rooms are small but I was not in my room that much at all. Rooms were also very clean. I have stayed in four hotels in NY and this one had my favorite location. Each morning, I walked just down the street to Starbucks and then another block to Central Park from Columbus Circle. The note. Is just behind Time Warner Center and I enjoyed stopping into Whole Foods for snacks and fruit. They have a super cool looking club/ bar that I was always too tired from the day to go to at night which I regret. It was featured in Sex and the City's ""Let There Be Light"" in season 6.... Not the reason that I stayed there as I learned that afterwards while watching the episode in a re-run. The rooftop bar is also fantastic.... I relaxed there a couple of evenings .... Fantastic view of the city! Anyway, I would definitely go back! Loved the Hudson- super hip and swanky....

"“Excellent lobby and bar but rooms a little on the small side” The lobby area is expansive and the outdoor bar area excellent. however, the corridors to the rooms were poorly lit and the rooms themselves very small.

"“Clostraphobic” My wife and I stayed at the Hudson after crosing from Southampton on the QM2. We were quite shocked at the small entrance to the hotel but at least the staff at the door were very polite and helpful. The immediate impression one gets is the opressive darkness of the loby and reception area. It is simply too dark. Once checked in we made our way to our room and again I was shocked by the darkness and claustraphobic atmosphere within the corridore. It was more like a submarine walkway than an hotel corridore. I carefully studdied the fire escape routes!!!.
The room was rediculously small. It was again, very dark. Nonetheless it was clean. 
The air conditioning duct is situated behind the bed headboard and when in operation the fan is so noisey that sleep is impossible. On top of this, the courtyard bars are extremely noisey with the accoustics of the enclosed structure adding to the late night din.
This is not a pleasant hotel to stay in. It seems like an architects and designers consept rather than a functional provider of accomodation... Would we go back.?.No. There is too much style over substance for our liking..This has no reflection on the staff who were excellent in all areas.",derek412,2011-07-01,223023,2011-07-29,False,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Fantastic location but extremely small rooms” The location is truly great. Lobby and the bar are on the list of New York attractions. Philip Stark is a great designer, no doubt. Sleeping at Hudson was not as exciting as having a Mojito at Hudson's bar. The rooms are smaller than ""tiny"". Beds are not comfortable, The steam heater was whistling into my ear every 30 minutes, because it was just behind the bed. You can't watch TV from the bed unless you keep your head in a very odd position going through the pain in your neck. The bathtub with a glass wall is the smallest bathtub I've ever been to.

“Horrible Service” Had a prepaid guaranteed reservation. Arrived after midnight and was exhausted because I had to work in the morning. There was one person working at the desk (and it is a big hotel). There is a long line with a lot of angry people. I waited a long time. It turns out when I got to the desk that there were no rooms available.....no explanation. I could wait an hour or I could take a room with a single bed. They could have handled this situation much better.

"“Corky unique European style hotel which you will either love or hate..” Hudson hotel is a place that you will either love it or will hate it so much that you might not want to go back there ever!
First, I was completely taken by surprise when the taxi dropped me off on 58th street and I walked up and down the street a couple times before asking the location of the hotel again...There is no sign showing the name of the hotel nor is there any way to know that small doorway is the entrance to a hotel on a busy street. 
Second, the room sizes are a little larger than a walk-in closet with barely, barely any space to walk around the bed. I wonder how they would accommodate two twin beds in a room this size which is less then 8 by 8. We had a full size bed in our room and bumped our heads so many times to the television screen that is mounted on the wall. Yes, there is no space to place anything on the ground except for the bed and a very small table. 
Third, this is what got me...the wall separating the bathroom from the main room is plain transparent glass which means you can actually look right into the bathroom. There is no question of having a private moment in the bathroom or on the toilet as we can see you even if you turn off the light! That might take a bit of getting used to for people who like their privacy in the bathroom. 
Fourth, There is no counter space in the bathroom and the sink is a corky little deep basin which is cute to see but just not practical. There is really NO space to keep anything so you will have to leave things on the floor. 
When we got here, we had no idea what to expect and were pleasantly surprised to see what we were getting for what we were paying. The cost is pretty steep for the space you are going to have. You will get three times this space in a conventional business hotel, where the bathrooms will be the size of this whole room. But if you are willing to be open to the experience, this is the place.",Mystic_hermit,2011-07-01,223023,2011-07-28,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Perfect hotel for first timers” Love the hotel: so chic and trendy. You really understand you are in New York because you live the city inside the hotel: its atmosphere, its guests, its staff all reminds you where you are. The rooms are small but stylish and have everything you need. Yoy have a nice terrace on the 15th floor, amazing to enjoy some drinks during summer.
Every night (buy specially on weekends) the ground terrace will be full of young people (from mid 20s to mid 40s) having some drinks and listening to music. So be prepared to enjoy the hotel a lot!
The location is great for first timers: 1 block away from Central Park, close to the Theatre District, the 5th Ave., The Rockefeller Center, the Apple Store... Next time I visit NY I'll definetely try another district (probably Greenwich Village or Tribeca). But it works just perfect for my first visit to this amazing city.
Love the hotel and the sorrounding area!

"“Overpriced, uncomfortable closet.” The atmoshpere was pretty hip and trendy. It is all very dimly lit. I did like the location. Close to the subway, cental park, and a drug and grocery store which was nice. Nice area not too far from touristy time square yet far enough away. Now the room was a different story. I actually started laughing when I walked in, shocked at the size of the closet that was our room. We were ""upgraded"" to a queen room upon check-in which really wasn't much of an upgrade. The bed (which is hard and extremely uncomfortable) takes up the whole room with maybe a foot and a half between the walls and the bed. On one side the tv hangs on the wall and was run into many times trying to get into bed. The bathroom is tiny. You can actually see into the bathroom from the room, through the glass shower. It has curtains which stick to you as you try to shower, and I'm only 5'1"" 100 lbs. Let's not forget the part of trying to get out of the shower without rubbing up on the toilet. Yuck. Oh, and women there is no counterspace. Overall it wasn't horrible, and I liked the location but I would not stay there again.

"“Pleasantly surprised!” I was a bit apprehensive given the number of poor reviews on here, however, our experience turned out well.
On arriving we were checked in quickly and efficiently, on entering ""our"" room, we were greeted by a couple in bed who were more than a little surprised that we interupted them.
Back down to reception then... as we were waiting for the lift down- the guy that checked us in (Chris) came to find us, realising his mistake and was extremely apologetic, took us personally to our new room and gave us free drinks vouchers for the inconvenience.
The way he dealt with this situation was exceptional. 
Our room was great (1455) , small but not nearly as small as some of the pictures I've seen on this site plenty of room to move about , bathroom had a full size bath and a shower. Lighting in the room was fantastic, lifts around the mirror in the bathroom, sides of the bed, on the ceiling, no problems here at all.
The hotel is in a brilliant location- 10 mins walk to Times Square, right by a major subway station and right on Central Park.

"“Location, Staff, Nightlife = Keeper” My ladyfriend and I stayed at the Hudson just after Thanksgiving and were very impressed after getting a bit nervous reading other people's reviews. It was her 30th birthday present from me and we wanted to do something special because this was her first time to New York! 
Because it was a special occasion we booked a Studio (deluxe or something like that). The room was on the smaller side but that didn't matter much because we were out on the town. But as we type this what really keeps coming to our minds are the so incredibly friendly staff and cool lobby & bar areas. After a long day shopping we would love to sit in the lobby and people watch. It was fun to watch the different people interact with the front desk staff. 
The closeness of the hotel to the famed sites of New York was a real plus. One morning we went jogging in Central Park which was right around the corner (but cold!). Also she wanted to go shopping of course and her beloved Bergdorf was close. We were pointed to some great restaurants around the hotel by the concierges (Bouchon and Marea - sp??) which was such a nice treat being walking distance. After dinner every night we would walk back to the hotel and hit the bars. Our fav was the one near the front desk area. It had a glass floor that was lit up and an awesome DJ. Fun, fun, fun.
All in all a great and memorable 30th bday present! We hope to come back for a Yankees game for my birthday (the concierge is working on tickets - ha!) and will def stay at the Hudson Hotel.",bootsbeaver,2010-11-01,223023,2010-12-03,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Small but doable” I stayed at the Hudson for 3 nights on business. When I arrived, the doormen were polite and the gentleman at the front desk was very helpful and nice. When I walked into my room I like seeing the wood floor, as I walked farther in I quickly realized how small the room was, and there was a metal chair with a tiny little desk. The bed pretty much takes up the whole place. The bathroom is really small and if you're tall, you may have issues using the toilet, because your knees will hit the wall.
Other than being very small, the only bad part was when I arrived I quickly checked the sheets, and there were hairs all over them. I called the front desk and they sent someone right up and changed all of the sheets and all pillow cases. I was happy with the quick response.
Overall, I'm pretty happy with my stay. If you're visting New York, the hotel is in a good location. If you're a business traveler who won't need to work in your hotel room for any extended period of time, I would recommend this hotel. If you need a desk and a chair, this place is not for you. The only other thing business travelers will need to be warry of is the tiny ironing board. If you need to iron anything, it will be a bit of a chore. I had to put the board on top of the tiny desk. I refuse to iron my clothes on the floor.
As long as you are traveling alone I would recommend this to anyone. Traveling with someone else will make for tight living quarters, however, if you plan to spend most of your time out and about, this place will work just fine.

We complained as well as other residents. The following night it happened again at the same time and we complained again. It then happened the 3rd night and made one last complaint as well as other residents once again. We had one good nights sleep.

"“Don't do it!” I've never written a review before but I've also never had to complain at a Hotel before let alone 3 times like we had to do at the Hudson. We stayed at the Hudson for 5 nights.
The first room that we had was very noisy and had duck tape around the window. The toilet did not flush properly and the plug was blocked so that the shower filled up with cold dirty water while you were showering first day.
We reported this to the reception and asked for a room change at 0730. We were told it would be arranged by 1500 and went out all day. We arrived back to find that they had put us in a room that already had bags in it and a slept in bed. We waited while they cleaned the room.
Next day morning there was all this horrid brown stuff at the bottom of the shower. And the plug appeared to be blocked again. We contacted the managment who said that they would get it sorted and gave us free breakfast and drinks vouchers.
Well this was nice but we could buy our own breakfast we just wanted to be able to shower.
The next day the shower was still not workin properly and we talked to Justin the manager again and gave them back the vouchers. He said that he would refund 2 days and email us that afternoon. 
It was been 6 days and we have not heard from him.

"“Better than Expected” After reading all the recent reviews, and after experiencing some issues of my own with my booking, I went to New York not expecting a much from the Hudson Hotel. I am very happy to say that I have walked away a happy customer.
Firstly, the hotel was very easy to find with the shuttle company having no problems at all with location. As we entered the street it stood out straight away and looked exactly like the photos I had seen in my research. We were greeted by very friendly staff who took care of our bags. The foyer is amazing and on first impressions we were impressed with the wow factor! On checking-in, we voiced our concerns of e-mail and phone service we had received prior to our arrival, to Sunny on reception who immediately apologised and offered us complimentary cocktails. He was very friendly and professional.
On checking into our room we were more than pleased with the space, light and quality features of the room. We had three staying in a double deluxe room and there was more than enough room for all our luggage as well as the shopping we accumulated during our 10 day stay. The room was bright, we could easily walk around our beds and the bathroom was more than big enough. Tv was mounted in a hide away space which could be pulled out or put away. We had a solid door leading inot the bathroom which was great as was little worried about some reviews that reported a glass door, indicating no privacy. We were also very happy with the location and the surrounding shops. There was no problem finding a supermarket or somewhere close by for breakfast. We were located on the 11th floor and could not hear the night club that runs most nights. 
The only small gripes we had were we booked a room with a park view but we were given street view which was slightly noisy but we soon adjusted. Towards the end of stay house keeping didn't provide us with towels and on three occasions we had to call to request them. Not sure why this occured. Pillows are way too soft but that's only a minor complaint. I am sure I could have resolved this if I asked. We were dissapointed that the roof top terrace and Hudson private garden weren't open as this was not advertised on there website when we booked but really, we spent so much time site seeing that we didn't really get a chance to make the most of hotel facilities.
Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would look at booking this again when I return. It is quite a funky, trendy hotel and may not suit everyones taste but I think it captured a unique New York experince for me as a first time New York visitor and can't wait to return.

"“Great location, clean modern hotel.” The Hudson most likely does not have us (a middle age couple with a 4 year old child) in mind as their target demographic. Nonetheless, we had a great experience at the Hudson! 
We had a double deluxe room, which had plenty of room and was nicely appointed. I really liked the decor. Very spare and modern. I prefer this as I feel like it is easy to tell if it is clean (it was). Most upscale hotels have lots of thick squishy carpet and tons of pleated drapery and all I can think is that it can't get cleaned thoroughly. This place was clean and had a sleek feel to it. 
Our bathroom was a good size and the towels and toiletries are top notch. The sheets and bedding were great and I loved the pillows (seriously thought about taking one, but resisted). My only complaint was the mattress was not ideal, I could feel the springs, but perhaps I am just accustomed to a foam mattress. For a few days there was adequate clothing storage, but for a business traveler it might be a bit short on clothing storage (pegs, closet with bar, small shelves, but no dresser/drawers).
The main areas are not well lit, but are enchanting. The lobby is very cool with vines, nice couches, and an offset chandelier. Lots of elevators with minimal waiting. 
Everyone was pleasant/friendly and the other guests are a great mixture of ages and nationalities.
Location was fantastic, could not be beat. Close to Central Park, the subway, etc. Starbucks, sushi, Pinkberry, drugstore, etc all in the same block.
Would definitely consider staying again. Very nice.

"“Trendy hotel, well located, rooms are tiny, but overall good value” We stayed for 5 nights in November 2010 in a room on the 6th floor. The lobby and bar areas are very trendy - similar to what you'd expect from a UK Malmaison hotel. Our room was on the 6th floor with the window onto the street. The rooms are very small, and the bathroom is the size of a wardrobe - if you're 5'6"" your knees will touch the wall when you're on the loo! Similar size to a room on a cruise ship or large private boat.... Very well designed rooms distract you from it's size, but don't take too much luggage!
As our room faced onto the street the standard New York noise of sirens and tooting horns was quite loud. Unfortunately our air conditioning unit was broken and made a random banging noise even when off, which didn't help. One tip - do not use the internet computers in the Business Centre... the charge is $7 per 15 mins, but it's so slow that it's quicker and cheaper (!) to use your 3G phone.
The location worked well for us - just off central park, and 15 mins walk to Times Square. It's also very near a metro stop so getting around the city is very easy, so it's a good base. Lots of Coffee shops and breakfast places within a stone's throw so brilliant for getting up and out in the morning.
The two bars are very funky and are buzzing most nights - drinks are expensive at $9 for a bottle of beer.
Given the price relative to other hotels, I maintain that we got good value given the location and trendiness of the hotel and overall we enjoyed our stay.

"“Tries too hard....” I travel to NYC for work about 5 - 6 times a year and make it a point to stay at a different hotel each time because its a fun way to see different parts of the city and check out different hotel scenes. I won't be staying here again and here is why....
Checking into my room took forever. I was late for a client dinner so was kind of in a rush. To make a long story short they gave me keys to a room that had luggage in it. Albeit it was all packed up but still. Went back down to the front desk to tell them I wanted a new room and they assured me the luggage would be out of the room by the time I got back up there . They claimed someone had checked out and the bellman hadn't claimed the luggage yet. I demanded a new room as I was creeped out and they assured me there were no rooms left. But yet there were 20 ppl in line waiting to check in so wonder what rooms they got?
The room was a joke. The toilet was about 6 inches from the wall -- as someone who is 6ft tall I barely fit. And the bathroom so small I had to stand outside of it to blowdry my hair. The room has this strange dark wood paneling on it and the windows are poorly sealed. I could hear street noise all night long and I was on a higher floor. I am used to noise as I live in downtown Chicago, but this was unnecessarily loud. And no full length mirror.
Lastly, I had a long day of meetings and just wanted to come back to the room and order room service, but the choices are very very limited. Not what I expected of a hotel of this ""caliber.""

"“Looking for a cool and hip hotel with great service but don't want to pay a fortune.....” I have now stayed three times at the Hudson and never written a review so thought it was about time. 
The Hudson is an absolute gem!! This hotel knows how to get it right each and every time. From the doormen who help you with your bags and hail cabs in the heat or pouring rain, to the front desk staff who are so very helpful to the concierge who helped get us tix to Jersey Boys and great dinner reservations. We had the chance to meet Simon, the general mamanger when he was making his ronds to ensure the hotel guests were having a great time. He recommended some great paces for us to venture out to and even arranged to have one lounge waive the cover charge.
The rooms are typical NY, not that large but the bathroom was spacious and the housekeeping staff was very attentive and didn't mind bringing more towels, hangars and extras of the amazing bath products.
Location is prime close to Columbus Circle shops, subway and Pinkberry!
The hotel roof top lounge is ultra hip without being overly pretentious, we ended up staying there one night as we were having so much fun taking in all the atmosphere and meeting locals and tourists alike.

"“A better Youth-Hostel - Rooftop Terrace closed - Garden closed” This was one of my huge mistakes on the tour through the States. We expect a lot - we got nothing. As an frequent traveller I stayed in hundreds or thousands of hotels worldwide - but this room is just a bad joke. Totally overpriced for a goodlooking store room.
The facts:
The room: I believe - 9 qm. One Bed - you can´t get out in an normal way. Just a half step between the wall and the bed. They use mirrors to enlarge the room, It is impossible to deposit one or two opened suitcases in the room - or even to arrange your lugagge. You have to wait until your Partner is ready with everything, you can´t use the room in the same time, there is just space for one person or less! 
Behind the bed - there is the Aircon/Heating - so you can´t get sleep or you switch it off. I never felt comfortable. During nighttime it was terrible cold in the room.
The Toilets: Step in, sit down, don´t move. At least, we used the Toilets in the Lobby, they were more spacious then the room we booked.
The Shower: Step in, don´t move, but ok.
Nothing more to talk about. Since october the Rooftop-Bar is closed, even the Garden. So there is not enough public space to hang around and to enjoy the hotel. You just have the LIberary and the Bar inside. Of course the Entrance looks great, its impressing, fantastic architecture. But how much time you spent there? 10 Minutes or less? 
The breakfast is totaly overpriced. Around the hotel there are some nice spots.
At least - the room was clean, the Service ok. Late check-out - just one more hour. 
Save your money - if you wonna have great days in NYC - there are some better places to stay in wintertime. May be, my rating would be better in summer...

"“Complaicency breeds contempt” Having stayed at the hotel several times over the past 10 years, we were very disappointed on this occasion. It seems who serves you matters. When we asked for something off menu that was provided the previous day by a helpful staff member, the cooks thought it appropriate to try to humiliate a lone female: All laughing etc in a crowded restuarant. Perhaps it's inate within the staff, since at best the duty manager, Justin Yatwa condoned the behaviour, and at the very least dispmissed it. A real shame, since it would not have taken much in the form of customer service to deal with the issue. Perhaps a refresher course in customer service for the staff wouldn't go amiss. Difficulty is that this comes on the back of a prior complaint on a previous occasion when the hotel failed to wake us for an international flight, which was very nearly missed, making a nasty end to a pleasant trip. Before that, somebody elses body hair was left on the bed, and in the bathroom. A little more effort would make all the difference.

"“Worse than I remembered” My second stay there and it was worse than I remembered. Of course, the rooms are insanely small but that's typical for NY (although the Royalton is better). But small isn't the real problem: there are no drawers, two people could never share this room, the sirens are constant, the noise from the hall incessant (the door doesn't seal so you hear everything!) and the HVAC was so loud I had to choose between waking all night from the noise or freezing (I chose freezing.)
The bathroom was dirty and the tub was peeling. I had to call 3 times to get the stopper fixed so I could take a bath. The hairdryer was broken. 
The staff varies from snotty and condescending to clueless and inept.
At least there were no bedbugs. Really, that's the only positive comment I can make. Oh, and the location is fantastic.",BuffCrone,2010-11-01,223023,2010-11-20,False,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Decent hotel, but staff is just horrible” I hate to give this hotel a negative review, because generally my stays here are pleasant- but seriously, the staff at the Hudson NYC Is just absolutely terrible.
The good: The Hudson NYC is a great intersection between hip and reasonably priced. You won't find a truly hip hotel that is more reasonable in NYC.
The bad; What do you sacrifice? People complain of the small rooms here, but I actually think that's fine: I like a hotel that pushes people out of their rooms and into communal areas
The real problem here is the service, which is just utterly horrible. They must focus all their energy on check-in staff, because after you check in, service is pretty much non-existant. And I don't mean ""hip hotel"" bad service, I mean Denny's at 3am bad service. I've stayed here several times, and this is the only consistent. Two examples:
I was trying to sleep in and forgot to put the do not disturb sign outside my room- do not make this mistake. Not only did they open my door three times in one hour, each time me yelling come back later, the last time the maid had a yealling conversation with me asking if I was going to leave and when I was going to do so. Then it was social hour outside my room for the maids: they conversed loudly as I failed to sleep off my jet lag. I can deal with bad service as long as it doesn't get in the way of sleeping.
Never has a front desk hung up on me more than here. General rule of thumb: you need to call about five times to get someone and then you literally need to call again and again for the most basic stuff. Nothing more annoying then a hotel guest who asks random staff to perform duties outside their role, similarly pretty annoying when hotel staff tell you they don't do what you're asking with no suggested solution. Maybe this explains the forgotten wake up calls, but having to wait 90 mins for a toothbrush to be delivered to my room and calling over and over for it- that will ruin your morning.
The service here is actually bad enough to mess your stay up, trust me.
Lastly, if you do stay here, shoot for spring or summer so you can take advantage of the roof terrace and private garden. Both are pretty sweet but close in the winter.",NoahKAllen,2010-11-01,223023,2010-11-16,True,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Disappointed in Morgan's Hotel Group --- 98 degrees” Hudson Hotel
Stayed at the Hudson Hotel for business earlier this week. I booked for one night and considered extending my stay initially. Having traveled in varies rooms nationally, I was extremely surprised and amazed about the size of the ‘dorm’ room. Despite the size of the room, the staff (especially Michael) and location are great. 
I was familiar with the hotel and its nightlife however; I still don’t understand why they don’t get a proper sign outside. Also, the elevators run extremely slow no matter what time of day it is. 
Having stayed at the Shore Club in MIA and the Mondrian in LA, I was extremely disappointed at the Morgan’s Hotel Group property, Hudson Hotel, in NYC.
1) The heating/cooling system wasn’t working and I woke up at 5am experiencing an asthma attack because the temperature in the room was 98 degrees!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2) I realized that our phone didn’t work when I tried to call the front desk in the am
3) The bathtub drain was clogged and the water was stopped up in the tub
Prior to my experience, I had been a fan of the Morgan Hotel Group and considered booking 50 rooms for a business conference in NYC in 2011. I hope somehow the hotel is able to win me back as a consumer and admirer in the near future.",Ask_tiff,2010-11-01,223023,2010-11-15,False,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Power Outages and Fruit Flies...This hotel is trying to be something its not!” This was our first trip to New York City and we had heard that the best thing to do was to book through Priceline. We set the parameters for a 3 ½ star hotel in midtown. Priceline booked us into the Hudson on West 58th. The website for the hotel had great pictures and seemed like a very nice chic hotel. I checked tripadvisor for reviews and was a little concerned with what I read. In an effort to make our stay as seamless as possible, I sent an email to the hotel. I just wanted to make sure we would get a non smoking room with a queen bed, I didn’t think that was too much to ask. When I did not hear back within 2 days, I emailed the hotel again; still no response. I then decided to call the hotel and spoke to a lovely young lady (Diana) at the reception who was extremely helpful. She even suggested that I contact the concierge desk to get some suggestions on what to do and where to eat. She graciously transferred my call. There was no answer at the Concierge desk, so I left a detailed message with 2 phone numbers where I could be reached. Once again, no one contacted me. After 2 days, I was starting to feel nervous, so I called the hotel and left a message with Assistant Front Office Manager expressing my concern with the lack of response I had received. He called me back and left me a message letting me know that the hotel had upgraded us and had asked the concierge to contact me. 
We arrived at the hotel and we very impressed with the lobby and then the Front Office staff. A young man by the name of Chris checked us in and was fantastic! I can’t say enough about the staff and their desire to exceed their guests’ expectations. I feel bad for them as they are continuously having to apologize for the hotels shortcomings. 
We eventually made it to our room. Now if you are looking for a large room, this is probably not the best place to book. The rooms are small, but if you have travelled through Europe, this won’t bother you. I am sad to say that it all went downhill from there. 
My husband took a shower the next morning and a bunch of flies flew out of the showerhead (yuk!!). Additionally, some of the tiles were cracked and not very clean. Once we killed all the flies, I took my shower and then proceeded to drying my hair. After about 2 minutes of having the hairdryer going, the power went out. We then called the front desk (they were very apologetic) and they sent the engineer to turn the power back on. I then resumed drying my hair and the power went our again!!! We called the front desk again and they said they would send the engineer once more. At this point I decided that I would be spending my morning trying to get my hair dry, so we headed out (wet hair and all) to start seeing the sights. On our way out, we mentioned our issue to the Manager (Jackie) in the lobby. She was very sweet an assured us that this would be looked into. I should mention that this was at 10 am. We returned to our room later that evening, around 8pm, to find that the power had never been turned back on. Although the bed had been made, the fact that there was no power would lead me to believe that the maid did not vacuum or clean the bathroom. The room was blistering hot as the air conditioning had not been functioning all day (no power). We called the reception, yet again, and explained our problem. The hotel employee was very apologetic (again) and assured us that the engineer was on his way up. After waiting 15 minutes in a warm dark room, someone walked by our room and poked their head in and went to the power panel to turn the power back on. I then went into the hallway to ask him why this kept happening. He informed me that maybe I shouldn’t use my hairdryer. There is more to our stay at this hotel, but I think I’ve mentioned enough to give you all a taste of what to expect.
From the exterior this seems like a very trendy spot, but it ends there. The management of the hotel need to start investing money in getting the rooms up to standard.

"“Overpriced for what it is - I expected something better” I've just returned from a New York business trip having stayed at the Hudson hotel for 3 nights. Before arriving I was very excited to be staying at the Hudson as I had been to the bar there many years ago, but never stayed at the hotel. On arrival the trip up the escalator is cool, with the green lighting and the reception area is lovely and the check-in was easy. Having arrived in the room, I was greeted with a small, pokey room where there barely enough room to swing a cat! The bathroom was tiny (just a sink, toilet and half sized bath with shower), the bed was a small double and there was hardly any room to walk around the side of the bed. 
The air conditioning wasn't working so I had to ring down to get someone to fix this which took a while and we had to ring a few times in the end. The TV signal was poor so couldn't get quite a few of the channels plus one of the coat hooks was hanging off the wall. I also found out that breakfast wasn't included in the room price and to be honest I expected better than what I got.
The bar (although very nice and cool) was very expensive and a room service cup of tea (which was the worst tea I've ever had cost $8!)
I had high hopes for this lovely looking hotel, but was very disappointed and wouldn't stay there again. The only good thing about it was it's location which was spot on but it comes at a very high price which isn't reflected I felt for what you get.
I would recommend people to go and have a drink in the bar because it's very cool and they play cool music but not to stay there, unless they want a pokey room for a high price.",KatherineStone,2010-11-01,223023,2010-11-15,False,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Style over function!” Very mixed stay at the Hudson. The entrance lobby is stunning and one of the nicest i have ever seen in a hotel. It's trendy and definitely has a 'wow' factor. The staff were helpful and friendly so no complaints there. 
Now on to the rooms...yes, they are very small but i have actually stayed in other new york hotels with similar small rooms. Overall though it is just not a very practical space...we couldnt find light switches, the bathroom has a glass wall that over NO privacy and most importantly, the air con unit was so noisy (and behind the head of the bed!) it kept us awake. Now, when i come to new york, i dont want to spend much time in the room so size doesnt matter that much, but what i do want is rest at the end of the day and the room didnt really work for that. so overall...very mixed.

"“Don't do it!” This hotel is riddled with problems, which the employees earnestly try to compensate for. I left feeling bad for them...and exhausted. Far from a relaxing getaway. The rooms have loud plumbing and heating systems that ping and bang throughout the night. The room cooled down very quickly but then got too cold, just as other reviewers stated! The lighting is inadequate (even for younger eyes). There was not enough room to open my suitcase, and my mom and I shared the limited clothes hangers in the closet. There were no bath towels provided. The ice buckets were kept near the ice machine on the even floors, but did not have liners. Eww. Forget about in-room coffee or tea.
Is this a three and a half star experience? No way.

"“Good location. Cool public spaces. Room was small - even by NY standards” My partner & I liked the location of the hotel in Hell's Kitchen; and liked the attention to details in the design of the public areas. Unfortunately, someone forgot to design the rooms for anyone over 3 feet tall & 40 lbs. Wow...the room was much small than a cabin on a cruise ship.
The 24 hour gym was closed for a couple of nights during the weekend to accomodate parties in the sub-basement, which was a bit inconvenient. (The hotel would have given us passes for a local gym, but it was already closed for the evening.) Otherwise, the gym was well equipped.
The front desk area gets crazy during evening check in times...it is well staffed; but the staff seems to spend a lot of time looking for rooms; and explaining to guests that ""no, there are no larger rooms available"". We had seen a video of the room, so it wasn't so shocking to us.
The sky terrace on level 15 and the ""private garden"" on level 1 were closed during our entire stay.

"“You gotta be kidding” Other reviewer have written about the small rooms. But the reality exceeded even my lowered expectations: 
Lights at the side of the bed where merely for show and were insufficient for reading.
No ceiling lights or standup lamps in room. Only mood lighting. Ridiculously dark.
No ice bucket in room. No glasses. No coffee maker.
No dresser, no wardrobe.
Shower was so small I had to stand sideways to raise my arms to wash my hair. 
Bathroom so dark I cut myself shaving every morning.
Hallways dark and overheated. Hallway floors don't appear to be vacuumed very day. 
Cleaning staff seems inadequate for number of rooms. My room was not cleaned until after 4pm each day.
Basement gym and third floor business center were unstaffed, poorly equipped and seemed to be after thoughts.

"“Form yes, function no” Nice enough staff at the front desk, if you're dealing with them in person. Once I got to my room it was ridiculously loud with the sounds of the NYC streets. I thought it was just bad sound proofing, and then I thought that my window was actually open. When I inspected the window I saw there was a giant gap in the frame which was stuffed with foam padding and cloth, which explained the draft and the fact that the temperature was set to 90 degrees and read 68, which dropped even lower overnight which made the shower lots of fun. I called down to the front desk to get a new room and they immediately said no, didn't hesitate at all. Then I asked for a full sized ironing board, which they stated are available upon request and of course it was not. I had to borrow a colleague's ironing board as she was one of the lucky ones.
All-in-all I was pretty disappointed, service was terrible and for the price of a room here you'd think they could afford to repair them.
And if you read any of the other posts here you'll read the bathrooms are tiny. Not to be gross but as a man who is 6' 3"" I could not sit down on the toilet, there simply was not enough room for my legs... unless of course I put them in the shower. If you're shorter you'll probably be fine. The shower itself was terrible. The shower head was totally gunked up and shot streams of water all of the place - not a heavenly shower by any means.

"“Form over function, a pretty dismal experience...” This hotel rates highly on the wow factor when you first arrive. Now this could go one of two ways depending on your frame of mind... We came off a late flight from London and hit the lobby right at the peak of it's 'nightclub' vibe. This is all well and good if you are there to party but I could not physically hear the reception staff and spent the entire conversation miming to them. Despite this, reception were friendly and helpful.
The rooms are pretty shocking. Having stayed at many other Schrager hotels (Mondrian/ Shore Club etc) I knew it would be pretty impractical but this was ridiculous. Here are my gripes:
-hanging space is 0.5 metres wide with 5 hangers
-no drawers to put clothes away (you end up stacking clothes everywhere which slightly defeats the point of having a 'design' style room)
-no slippers
-no dressing gown
-room so small I couldn't get around the TV to get into bed (I am not obese! and we were staying in a suite)
-no overhead lighting - thank God it was Halloween to help explain my mismatching clothes and make up.
-bathrooms remind you or an out of date nursing home
-bath so small you couldn't drown a hamster in it
-no fridge although they are snack areas on each floor which sounds great until you realise they are just big vending machines which isn't stylish or welcoming
- staff were rude in the bar and I thought one sullen girl was actually going to start a fight with me when I asked for another drink. Charmless and bolchy.
The whole lobby scene is just a bit naff and the furniture/ whole Schrager look is so over done it really feels about 10 years too late. Hotel definitely needs a refurb. If I see one more ghost chair in a hotel lobby...
On the plus side:
- breakast was lovely. Efficient and friendly service
- fabulous location just behind Colombus Circus, near the park and near to good shops
- room service was yummy (although each item comes with a $5 charge but 18% service on top!!!)
As a finale, some 'hilarious' joker decided to set off the fire alarm in the hotel bar somewhere so we spent the hours of 1-3am listening to announcements in the hallways telling us to evacuate/ not evacuate which was slightly disconcerting to say the least.

"“I keep coming back for more!” So far i've stayed at Hudson 4 times this year and I'll be going back on my next trip to NYC. Sure the rooms are small but who stays in the room when you have all of New York City to enjoy! Couple of years ago I had the misfortune of staying at the London NYC. While it's a beautifull hotel with spacious rooms, the service was BEYOND HORRIBLE. I was promissed better service on my next visit. Not only was the service still bad it actually got worse. Shame on me for going back.
Hudson is a refreshing change. The location is fantastic. Just steps from central park. On your way there pop into whole foods at the Time Warner building and pick up a light lunch to enjoy in the park. Or go around the corner for Oreo pancakes at the flame diner.
My favorite thing about Hudson is the staff. They're always gracious, friendly and professional. They remembered me as a returning guest on my second visit! The concierge always has great recommendations for me. If I ever need anything, Kimberly the guest experience manager, always goes above and beyond the call of duty.

"“Style Over Substance” The Hudson Hotel clearly places style over substance. What I mean by that is that the atmosphere and cool decorating is obviously more important to the owners than meeting basic expectations most of us have of a hotel- clean facilites and value for your money. 
For example- as others have stated, the rooms are very small. We had a studio / queen; and while this may be one of the bigger rooms in the hotel it was still smaller than pretty much any other standard hotel room I've stayed in across this country. Also, the shower curtain was stained and since the tub is so narrow, it wants to envelope you as you take a shower. Nasty. The rug looked barely vacuumed. The deadbolt on the door usually didn't work. The icemaker on our floor and the floor above us didn't work. The icemaker on the floor below did work but many of the ice cubes had specks of dirt in them. The ice tubs were all dirty. The room was dusty. A basic breakfast was $29. A bottle of beer was $9. One of our rooms wasn't ready for check in until after 4:30. I could go on and on.
When you pay over $500 a night, you should expect basic things such as the aformentioned to not be an issue. But at the Hudson, they are. We were part of a large group with several rooms, and I saw the same issues in the other rooms as well. Honestly, I find it insulting to pay so much and yet still have the issues we had.
I know the Hudson staff reads the reviews here from time to time since they do occasionally respond. My question is, how many times do people have to complain about the same things before you will actually do something about it? Talk is cheap. 
Yes, the location was great and the staff was friendly. But there are so many hotels in the area I cannot understand why anyone would return to this hotel.

"“too, too trendy” Do not expect a three and a half star hotel. All the staff is fairly young requiring repitition and finally raised voices to inspire follow up and fullfillment of promises they'd made -- to get something made right -- like the TV working. The inconsistancy was maddening. The bellman was terrific, the bed's were comfortable, the linens were great, but the halls were dark and narrow, the lobby was exceedingly uncomfortable especially if one is required to wait, the prices were high, the front desk was understaffed, the lines were interminable (wait till the last minute to book, offer half their posted rate, and you'll get what you want, roomwise. But be specific: don't expect two beds unless you get it in writing.) I will not stay there again. If I want a very small, dimly lit, European style room, I'll go to Europe.

"“If it were free I would not go back!!” Never Ever Again. We just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hudson Hotel which we paid $576 per night (including taxes). We travel to New York on a regular basis and have stayed in many different locations, some better than others, but none were anywhere near as bad as the Hudson.
I knew the rooms were going to be small and that the hotel had some very cool public spaces but this was a disaster of a hotel from the moment we arrived.
1. Upon arrival we were met with a long line of people waiting to check in. Stood in line for our room but were told that the room was not available till 3pm.(we had requested early check-in) That was okay as we knew it was not guaranteed. Thought we would have some lunch but hotels restaurant was closed. (closes at 2:15pm.) We went out for lunch and returned about an hour later. Long line- Room not ready - please have a seat!
2. 3:45pm. Lot of people sitting in lobby also waiting for rooms. Rooms still not ready.
3. 4:15pm. Stand in line - complain because rooms are supposed to be ready by 3pm.
4. 4:30pm. Given a room. we go to our room and are absolutely mortified by what we find. This room is so small. No place to put luggage, no drawers, noisy broken air conditioner right behind headboard. Broken headboard and water damage on ceiling. I call and complain, state that I want another room or am leaving. I am told that I will be billed even if I leave. Transferred to general manager and told to go back to the front desk and they will upgrade my room for a fee. I say I am not paying for an upgrade.
5. Stand in line. Given an upgrade to a studio on the 7th floor. This must be better.....NOT MUCH! (5:30pm)
6. The studio is definetly larger but not by much. It is so dark in the room. No lights other than 2 small lights at side of bed and a small desk lamp. In middle of day can barely see.
Bed is not a king which we originally had requested. It is a double. Duvet cover feels like paper towels and makes papery noise when you move. Room looks dingy and run down.
7. Shower which is 24"" wide has a curtain that comes into the shower when water is turned on, elbows hit wall when washing your hair. We have 2 towels and request more as we are going out at 7pm and would like to shower.
8. 6:30pm our luggage is finally brought to us after 2 phone calls. No time to get ready. Still no towels.
9. 12:30pm. We return to the hotel to a crowded entrance and lobby filled with mostly people in their 20's. Music from the nightclub is very very loud. We go up to our room and yes you can hear everything from the street below. We didn't hear the music but you could hear the crowds outside. All through the night you could hear noise from people in the hallways and outside.
The next day was pretty much a repeat of the first. I am sure in the summer time it would be very cool to have a drink outside in their gardens but unless you are in your 20's, plan on drinking at the club and don't want to travel, skip this hotel. There are so many better choices. The pictures on the website look way better than the rooms do.",lattelite,2010-10-01,223023,2010-10-24,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
“Enjoyed our stay” Stayed at The Hudson for 3 nights with friends. As many others have stated in the past the rooms are small. That was my only complaint. The hotel was clean. The atmosphere was modern and trendy. The staff was very nice and helpful. Everyone who worked there asked how we were doing and if we needed anything. The common areas were nice place to relax. They also have a bar/club at night.,Rkid010,2010-09-01,223023,2010-10-22,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“SMALLEST HOTEL ROOMS IN NY” The Hudson is quite a hip and funky hotel, great location, but its more like a nightclub than a hotel. And the standard rooms are TOO SMALL!!!! nowhere to hang clothes, nowhere to even put your cases, infact there isn't any room for anything. At $400 a night, not exactly value for money. We ended up paying for an upgrade, so that way we didn't feel claustraphoibic.

"“Wonderful hotel but don't expect a wardrobe!” The Hudson Hotel was everything we could expect from a stylish New York Hotel. The decor is effortlessly cool. The public areas are spacious and trendy. The restaurant was original and quirky with tasty food. There were only two negatives we could find. 
1. The bedrooms are VERY small, the bed feels like a fold out sofa and there was no where for us to un pack our bags. But we didn't come to NYC to stay in our room so it wasn't a big problem.
2. The gym seems to have little or no air conditioning. I like to run for at least 30 mins and this was a killer in that airless atmosphere.
On the whole we LOVED our stay at the Hudson. The great location. Being able to walk to Central park and all the shops on 5th Ave was fantastic and we must recommend Sushi Damo a few doors down. Yum yum!
P.s Don't ask the concierge to book your taxi to the airport... we were quoted $150 dollars for a $50 cab ride. You can get a black lincoln for $60 online.",fifimb83,2010-10-01,223023,2010-10-18,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Not a bad choice if you know what you are getting” I was a bit skeptical in staying because of all the bad reviews, but I had a very pleasant experience at this hotel. The staff and bellhops were extremely friendly and courtious, and I felt the service at this hotel was top notch. The lobby and outdoor bar/cafe are beautiful and really a unique setting in Manhatten. THe Library Bar was very cozy and really a nice suprise as well. Did not eat here so I cannot comment on the food, but the nightclub that hotel guests get in for free and dont wait in line was quite impressive, full of beautiful people, although a bit pretentious, and good music.
The room (standar_ was small but you know this going into this hotel. They were not tiny as some people stated, just small. I think I saw pictures of upgraded rooms and they seemed decent. THe shower cutain/privacy thing can easily be solved but just using both curtains, and again if you know this going in, it shouldnt be a problem. It seems most negative reviews were focused on the size of the rooms which if you can handle it is fine, or the service here which I found fantastic. 
Would I stay here with my family/kids to visit NYC? No, I would chose certainly another hotel. Would I stay here traveling solo/with friend to enjoy the city, nightlife and to only sleep in the hotel while be out most of the time, with cool/interesting hotel/lobby/bars, yes I would.",jfloMiami_FL,2010-10-01,223023,2010-10-18,False,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Proper NYC experience, quirky and super cool” I just got back from my first visit to NY with my partner. He had stayed at this hotel before and loved how quirky it was. I know most people have concerns about the room size, and yes, they are very small, but it totally worked for us. Afterall, if you are visiting NY, you don't need to spend much time in the hotel room! The rooms are well equipped and the size fits in with the nautical cabin theme. The shower was the best i've ever used and the bed was so comfortable. The location is perfect (right next to Columbus Circle). We booked through British Airways to get a good deal combined with flights.
Overall, I would definitely recommend to couples or groups of most ages. There were a few older travellers staying there who didn't seem to enjoy the atmosphere as much, but that doesn't mean all older travellers would be the same.
I would love to stay there again.",Fullygrownlady,2010-10-01,223023,2010-10-18,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Sleepless at the Hudson” Sure it's hip & chic, however don't count on getting a good nights sleep. We were greeted by a friendly staff & enticed by the modern decor, this place was hopping and appeared to be a good choice for our one night stay. Our room on the 14th floor, besides being a very tight fit (think cruise ship) didn't bother us, it was clean and comfy or so we thought, until it came time to sleep. The one mattress set upon a platform was a nightmare. What was this a boxspring? Springs poked at us all angles, luckily the extra pillows did help soften the blow, so we were able to get a few hours rest. I had to inform the front desk the next morning & was told that ""next time"" we visited they would upgrade our room.

"“I'm not hip enough for this hip hotel” This hotel is so hip they do not even have a sign telling you where it is. The only indication we found the place was all the people outside with luggage. I really hate places like that. There is a lot of middle ground from a huge blinking neon sign and nothing. A small plaque on the wall would have been nice.
 We checked in at noon (after waiting for 20 minutes), knowing our room might not be ready. It's wasn't, but it was not a big deal. We were told to find the 'host' or the 'guy with the clip-board' for our keys. When we came back at 5pm we found the clip-board guy and asked about our room he said ""I do not know what's going on"".... Umm, really? I guess his only job was to stand with a clip-board and look good. Then he said ""your room might not be ready"" What? it's been 5 hours. Of course the other line was really long. My husband demanded to see the manager (who never came out) and then we found out they lost our registration card and we had to fill out another one. Finally after 30 minutes we got to our room.
WOW, are they small, but clean. The bed was really low to the ground. I can see older people having problems getting out of bed. There was maybe 6 inches on either side of the bed. I found the lighting to be too dim. Maybe it's because I'm getting old.
 The only working empty outlet was above the toilet in the bathroom. Hip people have cell phones, laptops and cameras to charge, I was disappointed at the lack of outlets.
The bathroom was small, yet the sink was too big for the space. Actually it was so big there was no counter space to put down your stuff. The shower curtain attacked me. Seriously, the tub is small already, but the shower curtain kept blowing in and sticking to me. It was gross. I finally put the curtain outside, but that, of course, made the floor soaking wet.
The bars seemed nice, but we didn't spend much time there.
Overall it was clean and in a good location, but we were very disappointed in the staff. My husband and I work for a hotel, so we know how it should be done.

"“Gorgeous hotel, gorgeous people” The Hudson Hotel has beautiful common spaces-the lobby, the bars and restaurants, even escalator. The rooms were beautiful too.

"“Fine...mostly” For $200 on Priceline, this hotel in one of the most convenient locations in NY can be yours for the night. Regular prices for area hotels are far more so this might be worth a gamble. The trade-off is that you can almost touch all four walls from the bed. If something is broken (leaky faucet, jammed window, door that has trouble closing, etc.) you are on your own. That said, we were given a quiet room upon request. A gift basket that was to be delivered to my room was missing in the hotel and undelivered. When my sister called to track it down, it was in security and I was expected to go and retrieve it. Then when the staff offered to bring it up at 10 pm, it somehow didn't arrive until midnight. Lucky I was awake! 
I would recommend this hotel to bargain seekers because the benefits far outweigh the inconveniences. If you ask for a quieter room, they will do what they can to accommodate. There are 5 bars in the hotel and funky music pumps through the elevator and lobby. It is dark in the hallways- not creepy, just a little strange. Everyone is friendly enough so that counts for something.

"“budget chic hotel includes dorm size rooms” If you are looking for nightlife onsite as well as walking to time square/central park/theater/restaurants, this is the place. But be prepared to sleep in a matchbox size room. The hotel bar and sky terrace are very nice, but the rooms need major renovation. Bathroom is the size on a cruise ship. Bedroom has 1 foot perimeter around the bed and that is it. (standard room) Location is wonderful, staff was very nice. Unfortunately will not recommend again unless you can afford the suite! In a standard room with 2 people, there is no room for your suitcases, and certainly cannot share the bathroom to get ready.

"“I have ambivalent feelings regarding that place.” What first seems to be a designer hotel (designed by Philippe Starck) then turns out to be a standard New York hotel room with far less design you are used to as frequent visitor in contemporary European hotels, everything on mere 15 square meters. And they have a cockroach problem. We had killed one and presented it to the reception staff while other people were checking in. The staff probably felt uneasy and we were offered another room, a larger one, but on a smokers floor which was intolerably smelly. We refused this offer and were then upgraded to a suite with more than 30 sqm which then was fine by New York hotel standards.

"“Do not stay here! unless you under 5ft and under 25” Stayed here overnight from Jamaica on route home to the UK. Arrived 1.00am and like everyone else culd not see that it was a hotel - luckily taxi driver knew. Struggled up escalator with cases to be met with wall to wall noise in a dark dingy huge reception area that doubled as bar and disco for anyone 16 - 25. Male receptionist left us standing while he chatted and when he did eventually speak to us was glancing around and paying no attention to us - could be becasue we are very ancient and in our 50's.
He asked us for credit card which I know is standard but we said we honestly just wanted to get to bed as we had been travelling since 11.00am and would definitelynot be ordering anything. He was very rude and said we had to leave a credit card or we couldn't check in.
Found the lift which was in an area that is practically pitch black. Got to our room and could not get us and 2 suitcases into it. After a real struggle managed to wedge suitcases and then climb over. The rooms are very very very small!! They had a very strange smell of foot odour. We opened window as the noise from the air conditioning was so bad. The room has a standard double bed with approximately 1ft space either side. It is the smallest room I have ever stayed in. Calling it boutique may be trendy but it is not!!
The plus points are very central and Aveda products in the minscule bathroom.

"“Trendy does not equal comfort” The Hudson was definitely one of the trendiest hotels I've ever stayed at, which might have impressed me more in my younger days of business travel, but all this hotel did was make me miss the Courtyard Marriott, which I never thought would happen.
When my taxi first pulled up to the hotel, I was a little skeptical because all you see is a door with a doorman but no signage at all. After entering, there are still no signs anywhere saying where Registration was, but the only thing I saw was an escalator so I took it. At the top you're greeted with a large, dark lobby and what seems like a Registration desk in front of you. All four agents were helping people, and there didn't really seem like a place to stand in line, so I just stood in the middle of the room gawking at the decor. The check in process itself was pretty smooth and the agent explained where everything was. It just seemed like every where you turned was another bar.
I went up to settle in but my key card didn't work, so I had to schlep all the way back down and up again. Upon entering, I was shocked: it was the smallest room I had ever stayed in. Smaller than even my grad school single dorm that had a shared bathroom! Now I understood why there were so many bars! No one could possibly want to stay in their room longer than they needed to.
The bed itself was large and clean but quite low to the ground. It took a while for me to figure out how to turn the lights on and off, and even longer to locate where the outlets were. The only desk was tiny and the chair that came with it was metal; not very conducive to doing any work while I was there. Unfortunately, I was there for work. I wasn't able to get on to VPN, but I didn't realize this until I had already paid for 3 days of internet access.
The location was nice; very close to Columbus Circle, and I was able to walk to Nougatine and Ma Peche for dinner, plus there's a Pinkberry just down the street! It was a little hard to hail taxis in the morning, but Chris, the morning doorman was very nice to talk to while I waited.

"“dark, noisy, uncomfortable” It's a hotel for very, very, very, cool people who can find it despite it's not being marked. It's good if you have dilated pupils since it's dark everywhere- the lobbies, the elevators, the halls. All are painted dark colors- you can't push a button in the elevator without a flashlight. Meantime, there's a loud BEAT coming through the walls. 
We paid $450 for a tiny noisy room with one drawer. Could not read the room service menu it was so dark.

"“Cafeteria style supper on a tray - Weird but not Bad” It is somewhat Style over Substance at this old fave rave of the trendy boutique Shrager hotel. We were served by a very grumpy but handsome barman. Kind of typical old-style up himself barman who is really a wannabe rockstar kinda vibe.
The Food. Hhhhmmmm, where to start.
Hate to tell you this but it's a cafeteria. Really quite off putting in my view. Last time I ate in one of those was at school and that is not something I remember with any fondness at all.
Food that sits under hot white lamps is not my idea of a gourmet odyssey. There were plenty of curling items. But, amongst the somewhat scary airplane food, why would you choose to eat this way if you are not sitting in 14D?, there were some sunny moments. The fries are good.

"“Trendy but functional” Arrived at 11.30pm after difficult journey from Boston (the train was cancelled so we had to change to a bus at short notice). First problem, there is no sign outside to tell you that this is the Hudson Hotel, or indeed that the place is a hotel. Luckily our taxi driver knew the hote and assured us that he was dropping us off at the right place. 
Check in was efficient and the reception staff were friendly. Our room was on the 17th floor. Very small, more like a ships cabin, but it was clean and quite cosy. I liked the wood panelling, and there was a good view from the window towards the Hudson river. Slept well. We were given free WLAN for the first night, after that it was 10 dollars for 24 hours. Although we had not ordered breakfast we were allowed to help ourselves to large paper cups of coffee which we drank on the terrace outside the reception area which was nice. The staff seemed quite professional and were willing to chat when the< were not busy. The location was good, not far from Central Park and we were able to walk to Times Square in about 15 minutes and take in some street life on the way (quite safe, we walked back at 1.30am and we did not get mugged). There is a disco every night but we´re getting a bit old for that. Looks like it is popular with non-residents also. As far as the design goes, the reception area is too dark and the constant music gets annoying afer a while.

"“Over rated...” If I had known just how small the rooms are in the Hudson, I would have booked another hotel. I did my research on the hotel and the photos look very impressive! But when one actually sees it for real and not virtual, it was disappointing. The reception is busy, the lobby is a bustle, getting checked in requires a credit card security and I was given a magnetic key card for my room. However, when I got to the room, the door didn't open. So I had to go down to the lobby again with all my baggage, received another magnetic key and another room on the 15th floor - on the same floor as the Sky Terrace. The room is small, very small. My bedroom has more space. It had dark wooden panelled walls, small bathroom and sitting on the small toilet my knees almost touched the wall. The bed was comfortable and I slept well in it. However, the air conditioner at the head of the bed is quite loud, but adjustable. No coffee making facilities, I'm glad I bought my own little coffee maker. In the evening, the lobby is LOUD! Whooa... The Hudson Bar / Club is a place for young people to meet including a DJ and loud House music. I did not attend. Apparently, there is now a new Club in the basement with a far better sound system. The one in the Lobby is quite shrill. 
The location of the Hudson is excellent, a close walk to Columbus Circle & Central Park. The subway at 59th & Columbus is also very good to get anywhere in Manhattan. There are quite few shops, including a good pharmacy and supermarket across the street on W58th & 9th.

"“Stylish hotel to visit not to stay at...” Just stayed here for my 40th bday, always wanted to go to new york and chose this hotel from virgin holidays. On arrival very impressed with location and stylish interior, had read room sizes were on small side but thought would be able to cope with it.. Initially we did but as stay went on it got on our nerves. Our room was freezing! Window wouldnt close properly and there was a permanent draft, i alerted reception and was told the heating wasnt allowed to be turned on for another 2 weeks (never been told this before) was offered extra blankets to be sent to room, an hour later these still hadnt arrived. Rang down again and was told there was a backlog on blankets and they would be sent up. They never arrived.... Also our room safe didnt work. I think it is such a shame for such a beautiful hotel to be let down like this on simple points. It wasnt cheap and it spoiled my experience of a what was otherwise a great city break. Luckily we didnt spend much time in our room!! All in all a beautiful hotel to visit but not to stay at unless you get a room upgrade. Luckily we didnt do our shopping till end of stay as once we had we couldnt move around the bed!!!",w7hev,2010-10-01,223023,2010-10-06,False,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“I nearly cried!” I booked through Trailfinders at fairly short notice ( a month ahead) and for a period during New York Fashion Week so accept that my choice was limited. This was a surprise birthday present for my partner and I wanted it to be as close to perfect as possible. Checking in was fine and the public areas of the hotel are quite stunning if you can cope with the very dim lighting. 
However, I nearly cried when we opened the door to our room. My university hall of residence room back in the 70s was bigger than this and this was supposed to be for two people. There was barely space to get in or out of bed except from the bottom end of the bed. Lighting was ""moody"" but useless. Hanging space was minimal and there was nowhere to store luggage. The bathroom was the tiniest I have ever seen on dry land with one of the shelves coming away from the wall so, again, nowhere to put toiletries. No robes, no tea or coffee making facilities, although a hairdryer and iron were provided and the shampoo, conditioner and body lotion were good quality (Aveda).
There was a permanent musty smell and the air conditioning was very noisy. Hardly conducive to a romantic holiday! The room might be OK for a single person but not for a couple no matter how close you are! It might be OK for one night, maybe two, but we were staying for five!
A further disappointment was that on two nights the main bar was closed for a private party and the library bar as well on one night. The rain stopped access to the roof terrrace. As the cost of drinks was pretty outrageous, we were really only interested in people watching but it was made clear that this wasn't going to be an option unless we were prepared to stand all night in a dark corner of the foyer.
All in all, very disappointing.",Dudicrach,2010-09-01,223023,2010-10-01,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The room was large, very quiet (even though this is a very hip place with lots of night time entertainment in the hotel). The location is perfect-- 2 blks from Columbus Circle and several metro lines. Personnel at all levels was very accommodating. I will stay here again.

"“Staying in a coffin” Where should I start?
There is so much to tell. First let me give some examples of the challenges I've experienced with the rooms. Okay. First of all, I was warned that most of the hotel rooms in NY manhattan are really small. The rooms in the Hudson hotel are so small, that you cannot:
- watch television from your bed without twisting your neck
- sit on the toilet (there isn't enough room for sitting normally)
- take your baggage out from your suitcase. There just isn't 9 square feet of open space.
Don't believe me, just check their site or check some photo's
You can:
- sleep on the bed (good quality bed)
- take a shower
To summarize the size and quality of the room: Some bathrooms of other hotels are bigger then these rooms.
Service:
As you are paying $200 dollars a night you would expect some service. Some examples of what we experienced:
- no doormen, a doormen, five doormen, no doormen. On some days there are five doormen at the entrance opening the doors and arranging cabs for you. On most of the days we didn't see any doormen
- on three of the five days we stayed in the hotel (we payed in advance, stupid us) we could not enter the rooms. Both cards (we booked 2 rooms) where blocked. We got the explanation from the staff that that was because of some magnetic fields some stores produced at the exits. However on one occasion we just drank a coffee at the hotel bar and the card was blocked again.
- We waited multiple times for more then five minutes on the elevators. On most of the occasions the elevators that did stop at the lobby where full......
- We waited for 25 minutes for 1 coffee and 1 cappuccino. When we said it was taking to long and we where leaving we where abruptly halted by the staff that we could not leave without paying for something we did not get. After we paid the bill we expected the coffee to be served. It did not... for another 10 minutes. Come on... 35 minutes for 1 coffee and 1 cappuccino at 11 in the morning
- My dad (55 years old) who has problems with his knee was almost thrown on the ground by staff at the entrance of the restaurant. The waiter grabbed him at the elbow and pulled him abruptly backwards. The explanation: ""He should have waited for another 2 seconds before he could enter the restaurant"".... (really.. his colleague was waving at us to enter). I had to control myself not to throw the a#$%ole on the floor. Of course we did not enter the restaurant for breakfast and the staff wanted an explanation why we did not want to have breakfast. Do I need to spell it out????
Sleep quality:
- Okay, I need to say that the beds are lovely. I did sleep quite well
- The sound isolation is unbelievably bad. We where staying at the 7th floor and we could here loud conversations on the street level. Thank god I had some earplugs. 
- Bed linen is changed every day. Wonderful
To summarize everything:
if the quality and service is bad, but the price is good, okay, that can happen. But if all these three aspect are really bad you have a bad hotel. 
I will not stay in this hotel (and probably the whole chain) ever again. I will not recommend it to my family and friends. I will discourage them to stay here. Better said: I hope to forget it as soon as possible, but I just wanted to share my experiences with you guys. Hopefully you can avoid these experiences.",DeleR,2010-09-01,223023,2010-09-23,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Awful. Style over substance.” The Hudson drew us in, like many others, by the good location and flashy images showing the stylish hotel lobby and bars. Unfortunately, this is where the style ends. 
The room was tiny, even by Manhattan standards. The bed barely fit, the TV was attached in such a weird position on the wall which made it useless if laying down, maintenance was poor with a dangerous damaged power socket and badly finished plaster. The bathroom was so small that when the room was occupied by two you had to climb over one another and of dubious cleanliness. The air conditioning unit was placed unconventionally on the exterior wall which pumped cold area vertically resulting a sub zero area at one end of the room only. Worse still, the vent had the effect of letting all noise from outside into the room, and even on the 19th floor, every sound from a busy Manhattan street and adjacent air conditioning units prevented a single night's uninterrupted sleep. We complained about this on the first night, only to be abruptly informed that no other rooms were vacant - more or less ""tough luck"". Could things get any worse? Oh yes. On our third night, the smoke alarm started to emit an intermittent beeping in the middle of the night. This soon stopped so we assumed all was well, until 1.30am the following night when the same occurred, more persistently, prompting a call to reception which led to a room visit by maintenance staff. Their specialist attempts at resolving our problem consisted of removing the whole alarm from the wall, informing us it would be repaired the next day! Thank god the hotel didn't burst into flames that night leaving us oblivious to our fiery demise. At least we would have gone to our graves surrounded by an ipod dock and CD player.
The hotel bars were impressively designed. A shame then about the dismal drinks menu, arrogant staff, and ludicrous prices for watered down ""cocktails"". The choice of 3 bottled beers came in at $9 a piece, with cocktails at $16 each. Crazy.
Avoid this place at all costs. If you've got buckets of money and want to be seen in a pretentious bar, then visit here for a few drinks only. You are guaranteed a cramped, uncomfortable stay in a hotel which couldn't care less about your opinion or the quality of your stay. My negative comments on their e-mail survey have gone unanswered, as have the terrible reviews on trip advisor.",Alanmelon,2010-09-01,223023,2010-09-23,False,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Run as quicky as possible away from this property” Small, run down, shabby, dirty hotel. Super snotty employees who have no reason to be pretentious because this is nothing more than a high priced tenement. I've stayed in a nicer tent while camping. The room was damp, and musty and the air conditioner didn't work properly. All three of the rooms my company booked had issues, so it's not isolated. They are unresponsive to fix issues. There is a window into the rest of the room from the shower....so you can't even bathe in peace. The bathtub is approximately 3 feet long. Honestly, run screaming away from this terrible place. The bed is actually a futon. My sciatic nerve is killing me from the terrible sleep I got.

"“Want boring, go somewhere else, however need to get some basics right” Service great - I wasn't worried about the rooms being small, which they are, but dirty, which they are certainly not. So I asked Chris at the desk to show me a room before seeking an upgrade and he did and it fine, considering all we did was sleep there.
Check-in was good - they had floor managers dealing with the queues and when the lifts broke they provided champange to ease the stress. Its not perfect but i think they know that. Its certainly different,
The atmosphere is overdone but that is part of the allure, bars are good inside and out, the food, bit pretenious and expensive and keys on doors kept faling - have to get them recharged,pain when you are 12 floors up with crappy lifts. 
Having said all of that I've stayed in much worse and much more expensive hotels. This hotel made me feel like I was in New York, with a great location. near Central Park.

"“Very interesting experience, original exclusive hotel” Since my wife had already visited the Hudson hotel in 2008 i knew what to expect with regard to room dimensions. Ok, it is small but then again who comes to NY to stay in a hotelroom?? I booked a room directly at the Hudson website in april 2010 when they had a great special offer package.I payed the room in advance saving 25% on average rate which cost me about 160 dollars a night for a 10 night stay in a standard queen bedroom. You cant get much cheaper then this bearing in mind that there was no refund in case of problems but that was my risk to take. The experience overall got to me i must say. Very original, loungy atmosphere at the reception area.Many people seem to hate the fact that its quite dark in most hotel areas but i wasnt bothered at all. Original as i already mentioned. Since we only booked the room i cant comment on breakfast or restaurant experiences,we just didnt go there. The sky terrace on the 15th floor is a plus for sure. Great view and a nice place to relax after another busy day visiting the big apple. Worth mentionning aswell is the fitness area in the basement which is very well equipped for a hotel. As New York has stolen my heart, what a great city, i will definitely come back and the hudson hotel will be my spot to stay again.

"“This place is a joke” I don't even know where to start. This was the most strangest hotel I have ever been in (even in Europe). NYC is filled with trendy niche hotels but this one is just plain bizarre to the extreme!
I stayed here one night because I had to move hotels and NYC was filled everywhere and PriceLine put me here - ugh.
The Cons:
Take a building make it as dark as you can from the lobby to the halls to the rooms. Add the strangest furniture combinations (not even contemporary). The rooms are smaller than a walk in closest. NO ... I AM REALLY SERIOUS! Read all of my travel reviews... I am not some untraveled one timer that complains on tripadvisor - these are THE smallest rooms in America - I would be willing to bet that statement! It is insane. It is beyond NYC small rooms - it is smaller than a dorm room! I cannot even express how SMALL and cramped you are. The bed is so low to the ground and on plywood - futons are more comfy. There are two metal end ""tables"" - the lights are strange backlite colored creepy lights on the side of the bed. That is IT - nothing else can fit. If you have any luggage you have one little ""indent"" in the wall upon entry to store a duffle bag. 
The windows and AC are behind the bed - but the bed is so low and hard you cannot see out the window anyway. It is so dark! The paneling on the walls and the wood floors in the room are dark walnut color as well.
NOW, you think that is crazy... the bathroom is not enclosed for privacy. The shower (no tub) has a glass wall looking at the bed on one side and if you sit on the toilet you will hit your knees on the wall in front of you. You could shave, use the comode and shower all at once. There is literally NO PRIVACY - it is part of the small room. It is insane! 
Mostly Europeans staying here or college kids - which is fine - but not because it is cheaper - just because they don't care. 
I have never seen a hotel so far fetched and creepy. There is no insulation between rooms or hall - and since hard wood floors - you hear everything next door, in hall and above you like there is a speaker in your room. 
DO NOT STAY HERE FOR ANY REASON - you will be sorry and you will think of this review right away!

PROS: It's the hot spot with great clubs and music. If you want to see beautiful people this is the place to stay. The decor is amazing and if you want to lounge with your friends, this is the place. The staff was extremely helpful.
CONS: Unless you're staying in a suite, the regular rooms are tiny. The hallways and elevator are hot so for the hair straightening ladies, put it in a bun when you walk out your room until you exit the hotel. Do not stay in a room near the terrace or you will be up all night hearing music.

"“Ambience taken to the extreme...” Although a hip and buzzy hotel was expected, this was ambience gone mad. Inadequate lighting throughout the whole hotel and it was almost impossible to see the floor numbers on the buttons in the lift; the dark atmosphere was far too oppressive. Looks have been designated as more necessary than comfort. The room was ridiculously small for the price charged, hardly room to go to the toilet in the bathroom area. Cleaning was inadequate in the hall areas of the floor that we were on. Air conditioning very noisy in the room and the blinds inadequate to keep out the early morning light. Bed too small for average height man. Inadequate storage space for clothes and suitcases. Overall a hugely disappointing experience.

"“I booked this hotel on Priceline name...” I booked this hotel on Priceline name your own price. After reading reviews, I was very nervous about how small the rooms actually were. So, I called the hotel to see if I might be able to upgrade to a different room. The gentleman on the phone said I would have to request through Priceline, and Priceline said I would have to contact hotel. I tried the hotel 2 more time over the course of a week and was told that they couldnt do it and that they were sold out and couldnt give upgrade. Upon arrival, I asked once again, and they upgraded us from a standard queen room,150 sf, to a deluxe queen, aprox 200 sf. It was definitley worth it. It gave us a couple extra feet on one side of bed to put suitcases. 
As for the room, it is a very minimalist design. There is a night stand and light on either side of bed. The dlx room has addtnl chair and small table. The room was very dark with wood walls, and the only place with enough light to put on makeup was in the bathroom. The bed sits low with only a matress, no box spring, and after 4 nights really takes a toll on your back. The comforter and pillows were very uncomfortable as well. 
Our bathroom only had a very narrow shower which i thought would be fine, but after walking miles and miles during the day exploring the city, I really wanted a bath to soak my aching legs and back. 
If you need to iron, they dont have a full size ironing board and the mini one they have is a joke. 
I was hoping to relax and get some much needes sleep the first night, but it isnt possible to have quiet till after midnight when their outside bar closes. There is a constant bumping and people yelling. I would suggest bringing earplugs. I bought some after the first night. 
The hotel lobby is very nice, and the bars looked very posh, a little too much for me. If you are into the bar scene, interested in staying in a place that is a constant party, and uber sassy, this is the hotel for you. 
If you are looking for a relaxing retreat after exploring the hussle and bussle of the city, STAY AT ANOTHER HOTEL! I wish i would have!

"“Breathtaking environment, small but smart rooms and snooty service” Right when I walked in to the Hudson, I was in awe of the vibe. The shared/common space is not only smart it's straight out of a fairytale that instantly whisks you out of the dreary loud city (it was a rainy day when I first got there). Although there drink prices were astronomical where you got to sip your cocktails was second to none. The lobby level outdoor space is straight out of Alice in Wonderland and the rooftop bar/relaxation area is very Zen and romantic. When I visit NYC I'm generally out and about 90% of the time and therefore the small cabin like rooms did not bother me - I get it, enjoy the common space of the hotel and get out and enjoy the city. As for the front desk staff, they were the worst ever. 100% they were put out of their way by having to check me in - need I remind you that if your guests weren't there what do you think you would be doing?

"“style over substance - tiny room, poor service” I stayed at the Morgan during fahsion Week, so I suppose the prices were high because of that, nevertheless my room was miniscule - about a foot space round the bed and the bathroom smaller than a broom closet.

"“Maybe good for a short stay on a first visit to NYC” After reading all the bad reviews this hotel has got on TripAdvisor, I was expecting the worst experience ever. Anyway, it wasn't so bad, but I wouldn't recommend this property to a traveler staying more than one or two nights. Basically, the problems are:
1) Absolutely tiny rooms, the tiniest I've ever seen. There was no space to keep a bag open.
2) Noise. I couldn't hear noise from the street thanks to the great window isolation but I could hear people in other rooms and people in the corridors.
It's also dark, with too little light, but that's part of the decoration and, well, makes it a beautiful place. The check-in and check-out process were without many complaints. Beds were confortable and shower was great. The location is wonderful for a first visit to NYC, being next to Columbus Circle and a subway stop.

"“My MRI was Less Claustrophobic” I'm a frequent traveler to NYC for Fashion Week and in the past I have stayed exclusively at Morgans, also part of this hotel group. My family has also stayed at that hotel and I've stayed at Royalton with my husband. In other words, I was a repeat customer of this chain. When making reservations, I made my past experiences known including the exact rooms in which I had stayed. I also had all of my previous correspondence with the chain available so I knew the prior rates I had paid. I was quoted a price on a 'Superior Queen' that was higher than I had paid in the past and was told it was the best that could be done. Shame on me for not doing my research and assuming that my past patronage would be valued; it was not. 
I walked into my room and felt like I was 10 or 12 and camping. The walls were covered in a dark wood and the minuscule room was dominated by a very low, uncomfortable bed. There was one tiny chair and desk, two miniature nightstands and no mini-bar or dresser. This is not a room that would lend itself to ever having room service. The bathroom was also substandard with a tiny shower and no place to really spread out toiletries. This meant that every time one of us would need to shower we had to bring our supplies from the floor elsewhere in the room. And if you would find yourself needing to sit on the toilet (image?) you would find your knees against the wall you are facing - and I'm 5'2"".
Immediately it was clear that we didn't have enough towels, enough luggage racks (two were needed), a regular ironing board (rather than the laughable table version provided to use on the little desk I suppose) and we were without any robes for two unrelated women. I had to call for these items that I had always assumed would be provided as a minimum standard of comfort. The next morning I realized that the hotel had no shower gel or cotton swabs and by that time I was livid because of bad sleep. At least they had bar soap and a blow dryer
The hotel looks chic and has a nice selection of bars. I suppose if one were looking to hook up with someone this would be a nice enough venue. But if you were staying for days and traveling with a colleague you would find this hotel woefully lacking in comfort primarily due to the space constraints. 
I'm sure if I had paid more I would have had a bigger room. But I was not expecting to pay more within the chain in the same city and to get so much less. I would have appreciated candor that they would be unable to satisfy my needs as a business traveler rather than to learn this myself upon arrival. 
I will never stay at this location again. And at present I question if this chain values me as a loyal, repeat customer; it does not seem to be the case.

"“""TRENDY"" boutique style hotel in the ""HEART"" of the city” I stayed at the Hudson Hotel for a long weekend in Oct. I was very excited to be a guest at the hotel because of it reputation of being a stylish and trendy hotel, WHICH IT MOST DEFINATLEY WAS. The breakfast was delicious, however can be quite expensive for what you get. I suggest to go elsewhere for breakfast. The overall vibe of the hotel was Great. The concierge suggest great restaurants and bars.
The only downside was how SMALL the rooms were. It felt like being in a broom closet. It is new york after all, but this was extreme.

"“Great value, but there are better options!” I stayed at the Hudson Hotel last weekend. I booked it on Tablet Hotels, and it cost $189 on Friday and $209 on Saturday. This is EXCELLENT value for a clean and comfortable hotel with a bit more pizazz than your average chain hotel in New York City. However, I wasn't totally thrilled and likely won't go back unless I need a really cheap hotel quickly. 
Pros: The hotel is a good location for tourists, especially if you haven't explored NYC much. It's at 58th and 8th, close to many tourist attractions (Times Square, Grand Central Station, Broadway, Central Park, Bloomingdale's). More experienced NYC travelers will appreciate its proximity to Central Park on a nice day, as well as nearby Plaza Hotel, Campbell Apartment, and Per Se. It's a Morgans hotel, so the design is cool and trendy. The room was very clean and it quiet enough to get a good rest. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful in getting taxis. Of course, the price cannot be beat. 
Cons: The room was just too small. My boyfriend and I felt borderline claustrophobic after an hour (and we had to keep our blind shut due to the view of pipes and dirt). Although I have absolutely no complaints with cleanliness or service, it was hard to move around the room, there was virtually no storage space, and I could barely fit in the bathroom (and I'm a very petite woman). If you've been to NYC many times you likely won't be thrilled with the location. It was a $10-15 taxi ride to our favorite bars and restaurants downtown (and there was a subway issue so we mostly took cabs). It was difficult to find a bagel or deli sandwich nearby and we ended up wandering for a while at lunchtime. 
Also, we were eager to try the Hudson's famous bar/club on Saturday night. We left the East Village after dinner at Momofuku because we had heard great things about the Hudson's bars. However, we were disappointed that the rooftop closed at 11pm, and the main bar was a little too club-like for our tastes. I think it's had it's day...
But, if you're a college student or early 20-something looking for the whole NYC experience, the Hudson is great value. You'll get a clean, stylish room in a good location, with a few bars and a dance club to boot.",samanthaonstyle,2010-08-01,223023,2010-08-30,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Poor attempt at Poshness” We stayed at Hudson Hotel for almost an entire week. This hotel was chosen by our travel manager. I would never chosen this hotel but the location was fairly nice.
 The size of the rooms is crazy, a standard queen barely has enough space for one person to walk around let alone two. We upgraded for an extra 20.00 a night to a superior queen which adds about 4-6 feet to one side of the room. We had enough space for us and 3 suitcases and nothing else. 
The building looks as though it was built in the early 1900's and someone tried to renovate it into a hotel as cheaply as possible but still TRY to make it look trendy. The result was a very dark and very cramped building which at every turn puts form before function.
The room smelled musty as there is no ventilation fan for the bathroom, there is some sort of vent but it is on the wall and there is no fan so I assume there is plenty of mold growing in there. There was a black jumping bug infestation growing in our shower which the maid ignored and this tells me our shower was never even cleaned during our 1 week stay.
Room service and the bar are a complete joke, everything is so overpriced it is unaffordable for any normal traveler. A mixed drink is 16.00 plus tax and tip at the bar. Room service was so costly I took one look at the menu, laughed and put the menu away for the rest of my stay.
There is a ""bar"" outside on the terrace behind the front desk that thumps loud music until after 12pm almost everynight that can be heard from every guest room in the building.
The front desk staff could not figure out their own system when they put our bill togetherr and check out took me over 30 mins not including my wait in line.

The entrance is like a back door, the location is actually a bit off even though it is close to central park and the service is just ok. Maybe they already think they're too hip and does'nt bother?

A few days later I come home only to see that the hotel charged my visa an additional 35$ for parking because I apparently parked for 25$.

"“NYC rooms are tiny, but these are especially so. Good location.” The bar in this hotel is what keeps it going and presumably attracts customers, but it is expensive. Apparently it's quite exclusive unless you're a guest at the hotel. We did enjoy some cocktails there and it really does have a great atmosphere.
The rooms are small and include a small low double bed, a cupboard to hang a few clothes, small bedside tables, a desk and a TV with stand are all squeezed into the tiny wooden floored room. The artwork was nice.
The bathroom in our room was a small L shape with just a shower. The curtain to which couldn't be closed over the glass wall that separated it from the bedroom, this was fine for us as we're a couple but it would be more than a little awkward for friends sharing. With it being a small L shape you had to squeeze round the sink (I'm not large!).
The bed was small and fairly hard, over the 3 nights we were there I didn't get one good night's sleep. This was also due to the noise level, we were on the 10th floor overlooking the courtyard. The hotel building has a section open to the street (forms a sort of horseshoe) and the street noise carried up to our room, sirens and rubbish trucks (dustcarts) can be heard throughout the night.
When we arrived we had to queue about 15mins to check in in the afternoon, not terrbile.
Overall this hotel was very clean, had a good location for the park and subway and a nice bar. The rooms were smaller than any other I've had in my 3 trips to New York and the bed was uncomfortable.

"“Oh my, where to begin, other than to advise AVOID...” Let me just first say that if you are ""mini-me"", you might like The Hudson!!! Otherwise, avoid! Other reviewers certainly have not exaggerated about how tiny & cramped the rooms are at this hotel (and at check-in they even claimed that they were giving us an ""upgraded"" room; can't even imagine what the ""non-upgrade"" room would have been!!!) - I have never stayed in a hotel room this cramped; if one of us wanted to get something from the closet or go to the bathroom, the other literally had to move onto the bed to make space for movement within the room. THE LIGHTING: they seem to have attempted to be hip and cool with their lighting, but it was so dim that trying to read was next to impossible; and in the bathroom I could barely see to put my make-up on. THE BATHROOM: very, very odd; the bathtub/shower had a large picture window in it facing into the bedroom; you could wave (or whatever <g>) to your partner while showering! I truly have never seen anything quite like that and still cannot fathom WHY they would have done this (to make the room appear larger??!!) - VERY, VERY bizarre! The room was unbearably HOT except for a small vent which was behind the headboard of the bed, so none of the cool air circulated into the room. We often had to go and just stand right above it to try and cool off.
There are ice machines on each floor but no ice bucket in the room; I always travel with some Ziploc bags so got some ice in one of them - I was totally grossed out the next morning when I looked at the bag of melted ice, and it was literally filled with dirt and mildew; it would appear that they don't clean the ice machines too frequently.
The elevators were always full and cramped, so you often had to wait for several elevators to pass you by before one arrived with space to crowd into.
I will attempt to address a few ""positives"" of this place: all of the very young staff were very friendly, polite & helpful. The lobby is very attractive but also VERY loud because of a nightclub/bar very popular with young singles located RIGHT ACROSS from reception.
It should be noted, as well, that the rates at The Hudson are not particularly inexpensive and in fact are higher than many nicer and roomier hotels with better amenities.

The hotel is in a great location - near Columbus Circle - and the lobby is very chic and modern. That is pretty much where the positives stop.
The staff did the minimum - including the concierge - and it was very difficult to get someone to answer the phone at the front desk. The rooms are tiny, and if you stay below floor 14 - be prepared to listen to traffic noise all night. Did I mention how terrible the beds are already?
There is a bar in the lobby that, for some reason, is very popular at the moment. The decor is beyond tacky - and there are drunken douche bags in the lobby until about 3am. There are also drug dealers that stand outside the hotel entrance from about midnight to 3am.
Overall ... the service is crap, the rooms are crap, and aside from a cool lobby ... this hotel has nothing to offer. 
Please note that we sent a strongly worded letter to the manager of the Hudson Hotel several months ago - and have YET to hear a peep from anyone. Bad service trickles down from the top ...
*When I refer to lost mail - please note that I am referring to a replacement ATM Bank card - which was my sole access to money for my Christmas trip. The Bank told me the card had arrived - and the Hotel told me they had nothing - My husband had to walk down into the bowels of the hotel to ask security to look - after waiting - and several attempts to locate the letter - they found it - and had had it since that afternoon. We got no apology. This was my bank card - how secure is your luggage if they can't keep track of your mail?",Godwins,2009-12-01,223023,2010-03-22,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Never ever stay in this hotel!” We had booked the Hudson for five nights. We left after one. Don't know what was worse: the lack of any storage space whatsoever, the dried blood on the supposedly clean towels, the tobacco ash on the sheets, the falling-apart bathroom or the anaemic shower.

"“Wee But Worth It” This was our second stay at The Hudson, both times at an incredible bargain price through Hotwire, which admittedly affects the overall experience. The standard queen rooms were tiny but cleverly designed to accommodate two people. Some tips for comfort: go ahead and unpack your bags, and store them on the shelf in the open closet. There are shelves and a deep drawer, hooks and an open closet with lots of hangers—plenty of room for a four-day wardrobe for two people. There are 3 shelves in the comically miniscule bathrooms, enough space to set out toiletries. You're not going to be comfortable reading War and Peace while sitting on the tiny toilet.
Both times our room was immaculate and the beds comfortable, with good-quality sheets and feather comforters. The doormen were friendly and helpful, the desk staff ditto. The fantastic neighborhood offers a lot of options for eating, drinking and entertainment, so save the in-house bar for a nightcap and get out and enjoy the city from a home base can be a terrific bargain, depending on how and where you book your room.",charity_moonvan,2010-03-01,223023,2010-03-18,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Headed Downhill” I've been staying at the Hudson for about a decade, 3-4 times a year. Each time I check in its like my first stay, no recognition, nothing. You think they could store my basic information after a few visits (address, e-mail). The rooms are tiny, but serviceable for one person for a night or two. They are getting worn (missing desk lamp with a hole in the desk, chipped walls, broken door lock, etc), especially the hallways. Service is of the ""could care less"" type. Doormen more interested in talk among themselves, one check in clerk that could not even acknowledge your existence.

"“Great for young couples!” I landed the Hudson Hotel on Priceline for $106, which is a great rate. The first thing you'll notice about the hotel is that you don't even realize it's there. There's a doorman out front, but no obvious signs pointing to the fact that there is a hotel there. The funky-ness of the decor hits you as soon as you walk through the door and take the escalator up to the lobby. I felt a bit underdressed in my jeans and sweatshirt while cool hipsters and model-types hung out near the bar. The staff was pleasant with a bit of New York attitude (the bellman looked at me and said ""I can help you, but NOT them!"" as he pointed to the couple behind us). The room itself was tiny as advertised, but big enough for two people who really had no intention of spending a lot of time in the room. The location was great. The Hudson is one block from the Subway at Columbus Circle. One block in the other direction is 9th Avenue, which is lined with reasonably-priced restaurants and bars. Overall I would recommend the Hudson for young singles and couples who don't mind being in cramped quarters or in a ""trendy"" environment. I don't know if I would have enjoyed the stay so much with a family or group.",apagano,2010-03-01,223023,2010-03-16,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“First Impressions dont count afterall” I feel compelled to write this review having read some of the comments here. Like most, i was a little concerened after making my booking through expedia only later to read some of the reviews on this site. My reasons for concern were not eased upon arrival, when the doormen were too busy talking amongst themselves while me and my girlfriend struggled with our suitcases (didn't even open the door for us). Then, when we reached the top of the elevator, it seemed as though we walked in on some kind of photoshoot/ fimshoot in the hotel lobby where we had to wait over 10 minutes to be seen. It seemed as though we were seen as a hinderence to the shoot that was taking place. As first impressions go, it wasn't the best
HOWEVER, the rest of my stay was very nice indeed. As most people have already highlighted, the communal areas of the hotel are superb. The room size was more than adequate and the bathroom size, while small was sufficient for what we needed (i am over 6ft by the way). Contrary to many other opinions on this site, i did not consider the hallways dark at all and the music in the lifts was fun, surely not a valid reason for complaint.
While i relied on my trusty Timout Guide for the majority of my stay, i did have to consult with the recpetion staff on a couple of occasions for advice. They were always friendly and helpful. In fact, on my last night my wallet was lost/ stolen at Maddison Sq Garden and they helped me locate telephone numbers and cancel my credit cards using a complimentary phone. My compliments and huge thanks to Sarah (sara?) who took time out to help me in what was a very stressful experience.

"“Cool decor, not so cool service.” The hotel is really nice and hip. The location very good. Tiny room but we already knew it. The staff ok... Hotel policy rubbish. Let me explain why: 
Our connecting flight was delayed so we arrived 6am in NYC. We could not make a call but since we paid the hotel in advance (3 nights) we weren't that worried. BIG Mistake. When we got there they didn't have a room for us and we had to wait way too long. We were very tired. The staff at the front desk didn't seem to care much. They didn't apologise or offer us a complimentary drink or something they blamed us for not calling. I told them that they should have not given away our room since it was paid in advance (I could totally understand if it was just a booking) and that they were double profiting since they were charging us anyway. But they didn't care. We had some Breakfast. still no room. We practically had to stand by the front desk and push for it to be ready ASAP. To have this kind of start is not acceptable. I would still recommend the Hotel because of it's great location and nice decor.",sbs20,2010-03-01,223023,2010-03-15,True,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Shouldn't have gone back a second time.” I stayed at the Hudson 2 years ago and absolutely loved the hotel. I was with friends and we had a double room which was pretty big for New York hotels. The room was well decorated (as was the rest of the hotel), the garden bar was fantastic, the roof top lounge was gorgeous and overall my experience was great.
I decided to visit the Hudson one last time for a weekend two years later, and unfortunately that pleasant first experience was completely erased from my mind. First there was a 25 minute line just to check in (mind you this is at 11pm). At the check in, the staff member told us, without us asking, that the complimentary breakfast was from 7-11am. The next day AFTER having breakfast we learned that no, it wasn't so complimentary and that we had to pay $42 each for a subpar buffet. The funny thing is, our friends checked in at a different time and with another staff member and were told the same. When we confronted the manager about the deception, we were told that all 5 of us had misheard what the staff had said.
I had a queen standard room this time, which is literally the size of a closet. I'm not one to feel claustrophobic, but the size of the room leaves you feeling like a sardine in a can. It is so small I had to constantly put things back in my bag so I could walk around the room. The room looked worn out, the furniture was all nicked and scratched. Soon after settling into the room the radiator began making loud noises, which we hoped would go away. Well, it didn't, and I couldn't fall asleep. At 3am I had to call the front desk and ask for someone to come fix the radiator. Minutes later a drunk staff member comes to my room (yes, he was drunk as his eyes were rolling back and he could barely stand up straight) and tells me all he can do is shut off the water to all the radiators in that area so that the noise will stop. The noise soon stopped and I was able to finally fall asleep. The next day we switched rooms as the radiator began making noises once again (after waiting for 20 minutes on the phone for the front desk to answer, of course).
The Hudson is NOT what it used to be. The hotel is falling apart and cannot maintain its boutique hotel image anymore. What once felt glamorous and hip, now feels dated and dull. The service is the worst I have seen in a long time. No one should have to wait 25 minutes in line to check in. No one should have to wait 20 minutes on the phone in order to reach the front desk. The staff should not deceive the guests about complimentary breakfasts. To the management: If you don't have money to fix up your decaying infrastructure or to expand your rooms, focus on a spotless service and the guests won't notice your flaws. Unfortunately, nothing concealed The Hudson's flaws during my visit, in fact they were all I saw.

"“Better options in NYC” We were spending the weekend in the City for a theater show and decided to try something a bit more ""hip"" than the usual places. The lobby and common areas do not disappoint! The ivy covered ceiling and outdoor terrace, dim lighting really sets the mood. Too bad that's where they spent all the money in the renovation. What initial expectations they set with the common areas are dissipated the moment you walk off the elevator and are greeted with miles of corridors painted a dingy battleship gray punctuated by white doors. I am sure someone's idea of hip but imagine what awaits when you open your room door and are greeted with a room so small even by New York standards, that it sets a new definition of ""claustrophobic"". No place to store your clothing, other than on a small closet which had no shelving, bathroom so small you couldnt turn around in and a TV which you keep banging your head on every time you get up. The box springs were on the floor - no bed frame - presumably to make the room seem bigger. 
The staff are friendly for the most part but New York clueless. Skip the laughable breakfast - $29.00 for a fixed menu of scrambled eggs and sausage? For 2 people, sorry I want to order off a menu ! 
If you have anything more than a carry- on or are unwilling to book one of the larger rooms - for a lot more money - I would not consider these rooms.

My room, on the 18th floor, was exceptionally clean and well equipped for all of my needs. The negatives about the room - even with every light on, is still rather dark.

"“Thanks for letting me stay in your closet!” I made a horrible mistake!
Just figured that since our stay @ The Morgan hotel last year was comfortable and nice that this hotel of the same brand would be as well. Not so much. It was super small. So much so that my boyfriend and I had to completely stand out of each other's way to manuever throughout the room. Leaving the shower to get to the bed I had to crouch and scoot between the wall and bed. The beds were not all that cozy. I'm not a fan of the sheets only bed so I called down to housekeeping was they sent me a blanket up very quickly. That is probably the only good thing I have to say at all about The Hudson. The staff was super nice. Everyone we saw smiled and seemed genuinely warm and eager to help. Back to the room though...So the lighting is bad. Not like office lights, dressing room bad, I mean to say there is literally no real lights in the room. 
There were these decorative lights along the bed and one dim light over the from door and another dim light in the bathroom. There was a lamp on the desk but that light didn't work. I dont' know how I got dressed for the show we went to that evening. Between the non-existent lighting and the lack of mirrors and me shuffling to move around the room it was frustrating. The bathroom mirror consisted of a window which had been converted into a mirror. It of course was all steamed up. The only other mirror was a wall mirror that had a flat screen tv posted squarely in the middle of it. 
Not long after we arrived, I did go and inquire up a room upgrade and was told for an additional $120 we could have a bigger room. I declined as we were only staying one night. This was the first time I'd stayed in a hotel and couldn't wait to get out of it. The conceierge while nice gave us the wrong directions and that made us 20 minutes late for our show. We returned after the show, changed and went back out for the rest of the evening. There was a party going on when we returned so we hit the bar.

The rooms are small..but everyone has said this so i will not go on about it..its NYC after all and i was not expecting a huge room. What was more problematic is that this hotel offered the worst sleep I have ever had in a hotel. The mattress was old and too hard..and this comes from someone who likes firm mattresses normally. So after tossing and turning all night, at 7 am begins some work upstairs with hammers and banging. The staff response was that they would let the manager know. The banging continued. The TV was a very snowy LCD which got worse any time you turned the bathroom light on for some reason.

I had also noted from other reviews that the cleanliness was a plus here - I didn't see it.

The shower was dirty.

The remote control had dust on it.

""Actually it was pretty bad""
""I see- well we hope to see you again soon (in a friendly voice)

"“Exactly as Expected” Booked this hotel when I went to New York, because I worked as a supervisor for an online travel company that frequently received complaints on this hotel, and I guess I was tempted to see what all the fuss was about.
First, yes, the rooms are VERY small. That was the primary complaint we received on the property. After staying here myself, I refunded any customer I dealt with that had complaints about the size of the room and was staying for more than one night. Being in Manhattan, I expected a room tinier than my studio apartment at home, but this pushed the envelope just a little too far, especially for the price they charge.
Yes, on to that price...Given this hotels location, and the overall property itself, I feel the price was on the high end of what fair would be. This is a beautiful property, but if I had to stay in their rooms for an extended time, I would have gone insane.
We also had an issue with hot water while we were there. Had none, called to front desk, and maintenance was sent up within about 15 minutes. Since the water had been running 20 minutes by then, it was luke warm. We were on our way to a show on Broadway, and really didn't have time to wait for them to fix the shower. So luke warm shower it was, and they assured us they would work on the problem while we were out.
When we arrived back at about 2AM, the problem was solved, and a nice basket and letter from the manager was there for us. Case closed, as we weren't going to let something so small ruin our trip. It was an issue, yes, but they resolved it exactly as they should have, quickly and efficiently.
If the price was right...I MIGHT stay again but for no more than a night or two. In the future I would probably stay outside of Manhattan in exchange for a bigger room.
I would reccommend to a friend if they were looking for location, as this hotel most definitely has that, but they would get a stern warning about the room size.",JessR_G_10,2009-01-01,223023,2010-03-05,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Trendy and fun, but also comfortable, great location” We stayed here twice within a week because of my daughter's college auditions in New York. The hotel entrance and lobby are very interesting. Our first room, with two queen beds, was actually spacious and very comfortable. The rooms are also very clean-- I know because in order to find the electrical outlets I had to hunt around behind furniture for a power strip. No dustballs on the hardwood floors! The first room was very quiet; our only problem was that it was over-heated; even turning off the heater did not seem to help. Friends stayed in rooms that were extremely tiny; the difference was striking. There were no double queen rooms available for our current stay, so asked to be upgraded to a ""superior"" queen. The room is small, but not nearly as tiny as some. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful, although a sweater accidentally left in our room a few days ago has never turned up :(",elirnerak,2010-03-01,223023,2010-03-03,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hip, funky, great location but needs a few tweaks!” A surprise 30th birthday present from my husband - a trip to NYC! The hotel looked amazing on website and features in some cool brochures. My husband contacted the hotel prior to arrival requesting if they could look at making my birthday extra special and to book a table at the bar for our 1st night- no one replied. After calling, the concierge staff were pretty brisk and not that friendly. I work in the hotel business and was very surprised at this. After arriving, the welcome was ok. Again quite brisk - working for hotels in Florida and Mauritius, all the staff at my hotels would not get awat with that! Anyway - we loved the hotel immediatley. Great location, very cool and good atmosphere. Our room was tiny but we knew that. I think the biggest shock was the bathroom. Sitting on the toilet - our kneeds touched the wall in front! Could have done with bigger towels and the shower head to be removable so I could have a shower without getting my hair wet (no shower caps). Bed comfortable although the AC/Heating is behind the headboard so it is a little noisy. We got used it to so no worries for us! The room walls are a bit thin and the 2nd night we did hear the bar music but so tired we fell asleep not to long after. I think a kettle/tea/coffee would have been nice but there is a drink, ice and snack station on every floor. Hairdryer needed replacing as it was hot/cold/hot/cold - not consstent heat. When I told reception they didnt believe me and send another one to the room. The same thing happend so I just let it dry naturally instead - couldnt be bothered to complain again.
The bar is great - we loved it on our 1st night! Good music and a local crowd. I would have liked the table my husband tried to organise as we were stood up for ages. Apart from that, was a good place to start out before heading to Pacha.
Location excellend! Right on the red line (1) to get down to times sq, midtown and lower manhattan. Times Warner Centre is literally 2 mins walk and we had a great meal here at Porterhouse and drinks at Stone Rose bar. Also close to central park and the lovely shops around here. Broadway/Macy's area is a bit touristy and tacky with beggars etc so this was perfect!
We defintley want to come back and stay at the Hudson - I just think the staff need to cheer up a little and be more friendly, the hairdryers need looking at and they should make a fuss of you on a special occasion! You only turn 30 once! We will try to book a higher category of room so we have more space and a shower over bath would be nice. Tired legs from walking all day would benefit from a nice hot bath of an evening
All in all a cool hotel but service needs improving and you MUST be aware of the room sizes before booking.

"“can't wait to go back in April” Had been to the Hudson in Summer of 2008 with my boyfriend and had a great experience. The staff was super friendly and though our room was small it was comfortable and clean. Because my time at the Hudson was so positive I recommended to my girlfriends that we stay there for an upcoming stagette. However, after reading the tripadvisor reviews they were hesitant. I quickly convinced them that the few negative reviews were not representative of what a great hotel the Hudson actually was. The bar was great, the staff helpful and the decor of the hotel was awesome. Like others have said you don't go to NYC to sit in your hotel room, so the small room size is not a deterrent. As for location, it is perfect as it is a block away from a convenient subway stop, Columbus Circle and Central Park.

"“Tiny rooms, incredibly rude staff, never ever visit!” We waited for 20 mins to check in and the staff were genuinely rude and unhelpful. They seemed to value the drunk, obnoxious drinkers in the bar a lot more than their own guests. 
When finally given the key to our room (we weren't shown to it), we tripped over ourselves as there was barely enough room walk around the bed, let alone anywhere to put our bags. The shower room was also the size of an airoplane toilet with a shower at the end. Our room also stank of smoke so we insisted on changing.
We were due to stay for 4 nights but only spent the first night there (we had just landed from a late flight from London and it was too late to find an alternative) and checked out first thing in the morning.

"“Crash Pad” The room was clean & tiny. The bed was comfortable. The front desk staff was friendly. The bathroom was hard to navigate in. The walls were thin. The entrance is industrial and clubby with weird lighting and loud, pulsating music. I was not expecting luxury after reading previous posts Tripadvisor, but this room is suitable if you have activities in the area and need a place to crash. There is a charge for using the standalone pc on the floor, which I think is unusual. The toiletries were nice.

"“DON'T STAY HERE!” I reserved a Deluxe King, described on the Hudson website as having a River or Courtyard View. I requested a quiet room on a high floor. My reservation was booked a month in advance and guaranteed with a credit card. I telephoned the hotel to alert them to my late arrival time and requested they hold the quiet room on the upper floor. I was assured they would. I arrived at 9:00pm. The staff was young, dressed in black and hipper than thou. I was shown a room on the 23rd floor. It had NO WINDOWS, just blinds covering a wall. It was a tomb. While I sat in the hallway of their overcrowded bar and had a $19.00 hamburger, they found me a room on the 7th floor with two drafty windows overlooking 9th Ave. The heater unit was located at the head of the bed, so you had to listen to the motor all night. Also, there was approximately a two-inch space between the end of the toilet seat and the wall. I'd have to be lowered down by a winch. The shower was so small that the shower curtains stuck to my body as I washed. The deadbolt on my door was broken. No sleep. Next morning, I vacated the room and was assured they would save a different room upon the check-out of other guests. I returned late, after working all day. No room. No notes on my record for the request. The manager claimed I had originally been given a room on the 17th floor with a view. Not true. When I told him I had been given room 2315 which had no windows, he said it wasn't true or even possible. He said there were no rooms without windows. He further insisted they fulfilled my requests by offering the room on the 17th floor. Not true. He said I was unhappy because I wanted ""more windows."" I said not ""more windows"" but a window. The River or Courtyard view? No view. He was rude, saying he would offer me a room with two doubles or a queen standard.

"“Expensive with corrupt door staff” Was at this hotel in July 2009 and ws impressed with the reception area of the hotel, rooms were quite small but didn't bother me much as i was afterall in New York and wouldnt be sitting around in my room often. Having paid 22dollars for a bottle of miller and a vodka lemonade i was awaiting my change when the young barman looked as if i was commiting a crime as he handed me my change and said ""excuse me sir but you have to pay for gratitude services next time"" I just looked at him and couldnt believe the cheek of it!! All he did was opened a bottle and poured a vodka? Also on my last day i was racially abused by some homeless, toothless black man outside the front door and the doorman stood and did nothing!! Also noticed some of the doormen getting tips from taxi drivers if they got them a fare which would cost abit of money. All in all new york is a great city but wouldn't stay at the hudson again, it seems to me that some of the staff just want dollars for doing as little as possible to help, however the staff on reception were very helpful when i needed them.",Mikeyafc83,2009-07-01,223023,2010-02-20,False,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“You live & learn” My wife and I are in our early 40's. We spent 3 nights at The Hudson and it was our first trip to New York, so we were as green as hell! Travelled from JFK in a taxi. We knew the price in advance as it is set to Manahattan and well published on the internet guides i.e. $45 + $5 toll plus (in our case) $10 tip. It took about 40 mins. Driver knew The Hudson location. 
There was one, possibly two, guys right outside what turned out to be the un-signed main entrance (although it felt like the side door with a few large potted trees each side). They asked if I needed help with cases. I did not and I declined. My main point here is these guys had no identification displayed, no uniforms and did not say they were working for the hotel.Given that we thought this was a side entrance and the area is not overlooked by the reception or other staffed area, I wondered if these guys were officially associated with the hotel. I later found out they were.But I would suggest to management that there guys wear badges, or is that just too un-hip? The escalator to the lobby & reception was different and quite cool. 
We tried to check in too early i.e. before 3.00pm, that was probably our mistake by not reading some small print. It was not a big problem, as we stowed the cases in the hotel (free) and shot off to fully enjoy the afternoon. Having said that, it would have been ideal for a quick freshen up after a long trip from the UK- but we were so exited it was not a high priority- but, as a sugestion to the management, is there scope for a 'freshen up' room (not a general rest room/ toilet) for guests who arrive before 3pm?
Much later, we returned to fully check in, no problems there, very polite staff. The reception area is very nice and moodily lit, if I can put it like that. The receptionist rung down to the bagage stowing department and instructed them to bring our cases up to our room. When we got there, we had to ring down to chase them though and our wait was about 25 mins- no big deal in the grand scale of things. The corridors en-route to our room were moodily lit again- but not in a good way as per the lobby and other ground floor areas such as the bar. Just plain dark green walls- no pictures etc. I speculated over what they were trying to achieve here, or even hide ! Having watched too much US TV in my time, I was waiting for a cop to come bounding up the corridor and shoot the hinges off one of the room doors to gain access to some low life perp. inside !!
We expected the suite to be small (having read reviews on this site) and it was, but not too small for our needs. By that I mean we were hardly there anyway. We did not eat there at all, prefering to experience what the city beyond had too offer. I did buy one cocktail and a small bottle of beer one evening as we returned late. $26 !!!. The barman was not overly interested in my request for him to recommend a cocktail for my wife, as I had no clue about these types of drink. He just handed me the menue (no prices displayed) and walked away. Yes, it's a trendy hotel and bar etc. But it's not 5 star with the overtly rich as their bread and butter customers (Having seen our room size, I speculate that they surely stay elsewhere). So I felt he could have been a bit more helpful and even a little interested, or is that too un-hip also?
Having read a couple of reviews about the alledgedly dirty rooms, I was relieved to see ours had no such issues at all- very clean. The room staff we bumped into each day were poilite and always said ""good morning "" etc. We had no hair dryer, but a quick call resolved this, although I wonder if I should have tipped the guy who brought it up ! We had no bath robes, although they were on the inventory list. So the tip here is, make sure you have everything from the outset, or risk being charged for missing items. I told the receptionist about the robes as we were leaving, so if they feature on a future credit card bill I will not be happy ! 
One major issue for me was the fact that the room safe was not bolted to a wall or the interior of the cupboard it was in. It was small enough to just walk out with it under a coat, or in a box etc. I have never seen an un-secured safe in a hotel. So I didn't use it. I was very aware that absolutely anyone could access the hotel interior from the street without being spotted, let alone engaged, by staff. And what with all the dim lighting, I would imagine if thieves were going focuss on this potential method of theft, then this hotel would be an easier proposition. Yes, you could argue that even secured safes could still be ripped out, but I would suggest back that thieves are less likely to target those than ones you can just lift out, making much less noise and taking a fraction of the time.And yes, kicking the doors in would make noise, but I'm guessing city thieves nowadays have a way of breaching hotel doors without the use of force. Management will probably say this has never happened. Fair enough, but I was not going to be the first victim, partuicularly as all losses would have been mine, not the hotel. Yes, as per other reviews, the toilet was close to a wall. But I was OK for leg room wise ( I am just ovr 6 feet tall). The main isue for me was the design. The seat hole was just not long enough. But we managed OK.
I'm not a huge fan of beds close to the floor, and ours was. And I too, like a previous contributor, banged my head on the wall mounted TV when getting out of bed one morning. But I only did it once, unlike the previous guy! The heating system was noisy, but only background noise. Not a problem for me personally. We were on 14th floor, so that was the loudest thing we had to hear at night. I could not hear our neighbours, but then I don't think we had any!
We were luck with our views, included the Hudson River. Checking out was easy, we had no extras bill to pay, so we just left our keys in the room and left. The door guy hailed a taxi for us right outside.
Overall, I would say I would be happy to stay at The Hudson again. Location was great, very handy.

"“No complaints” No complaints!
I went in January 2010 and I was very satisfied. It is true rooms are small but I was told this is normal in New York. My room was simple but it all the necessary features. It had a minimalistic design I found very interesting. I liked it because it had just what I needed. 
I found the room and bathroom very clean and properly maintained. I did not find any weird smells of old things within the room or outside. Room service was excellent and people very friendly. All areas in the hotel have minimalistic design. It was always clean and elegant.
I did not try food service within the hotel, because very close are many options. My favorite was a European cafeteria just at the corner.
The location of the hotel is excellent. Taxi service is always available. The sub-way station is one block away and bus services are close too. 
The hotel charges 10 dollars a day for the Internet but there are many places around with free wifi. I used one day because I needed to do something important and it was faster than free places.
I did not find any cons. The lobby is a little bit dark but that is part of the design. It did not really bother me.

"“Hip, silly and pretentious!” Hudson Hotel is uber-hip, however the rooms are uber-small. The overall ""look"" was chic, but there needs to be practical amenities. There is substantially more leg room in an airplane lav than their bathrooms and the hooks don't even hold a towel, it was ridiculous really. The bar was trendy and the lobby cool, but the whole place was dark, which did annoy after a while. The check-in on Friday night was fine, super nice front desk person, however Saturday morning another person was at the desk and not so nice. We asked if breakfast was included and he said that he'd check, he called ""reservation"" and no one picked up, so he said that he did not have an answer. We said that we really needed to know, and he suggested that we go and have breakfast and IF it were included, it would be deducted from the bill...not a solution, as we think that we have a right to know either way, so we are not stuck with an over priced hotel breakfast. So we pressed again, he disappeared and came back minutes later and without looking us in the eye, simply and arrogantly said ""no"" and went on with his work. He needs some basic customer service training and a new attitude, it's not difficult to say ""I'm sorry, but the price you paid does not include breakfast"" or some other gracious explanation.

"“Amazing Hotel, Amazing City, Amazing Holiday!” Had a wonderful stay at the Hudson hotel, my husband and I were there for a week for my 30th and had a truly fabulous holiday! All the staff were extrememly friendly and helpful at the Hudson, they couldn't have been nicer! Guys on the front door were really helpful and on our first day gave us loads of advice on where to go etc. The hotel is very trendy, lovely reception area with a gorgeous chadelier, lobby was lovely too and the library bar was lovely for an early evening drink and a game of pool. Drinks however were slightly expensive, especially the wine but we found this to be the case in NYC. 
Room was lovely and clean although small but we knew this already from previous reviews so we weren't disappointed, room was a lot nicer than I thought it was going to be actually and it was cleaned every day. The staff at the concierge desk were really helpful too and sent us to some fab restaurants! BLT Market is a must, not far at all from the Hudson. We found the hotel to be in the perfect location, not too far from times square but far enough away to be away from it all. Sushi damo along from the Hotel is a lovely sushi restaurant/bar which is great for a few early evening drinks too. 
We had a fantastic holiday and couldn't fault one thing about the holiday or the hotel, we shall definately return to NYC in the future and hopefully it will be staying at the Hudson too.

As for you, the hotel sux anyway, it's dark, small yet has a price tag of a grand suite overlooking central park which it doesn't. The only reason anyone would stay in there is if they are drunk out of their mind and can't catch a cab.

"“Loved It” For our three year anniversary, my bf got us a room here for the weekend. Considering this is my first hotel over night stay in the city, I was floored. The hotel was very clean and stylish/modern, A+ for Syle. The room was small, 150 sq ft to be exact, but good enough for the two of us to feel comfortable. Location was amazing, accross from Time Warner, columbus circle; 1/2 block from Central Park; food, coffee nearby. The Hudson bar was really trendy and a bit crowded on Saturday night, music was okay (i hope they change the DJ), and show your hotel key to the bouncer and you get in for free. Amenities: Private Park looked adorable but closed for Spring, Library was cozy and loved the pool table. Oh! The towels were soooo soft, I could have taken 8 more showers, just to dry myself off. I should have taken one!
There were some cons, remote control was not working, I am a fan of switching channels so to me that kind of bothered me but we were not in our room long enough to really give me time to call housekeeping. Hardwood floor, it seems they replaced some boards but did not measure correctly and there were gaps. Watch your heels! Request a room not facing the street or on a high floor, our room faced 58 Street and we could hear the traffic a bit.

"“Small room but nice design” Stayed on a Thursday night in January. As others have mentioned, the lobby is terrific, very striking as you come up the escalator. The ""Library"" bar is also a great design. The terrace looks great but is closed in winter.
Agree with others who found the room to be small. Bathroom is tiny even by NYC standards. Glass wall between shower stall and bedroom was an interesting touch (you can close a curtain if you are modest.)
Some reviewers complain of bad view, but my room had a decent view of the city (photo attached); you can probably request this if it's a priority for you.
Location is very convenient, walking distance to some attractions, multiple subway lines at Columbus Circle will take you plenty of other places.

"“Hudson Hotel New York City - OK if your a midget” Trendy Hotel in a good location. Popular with locals for drinking and dancing.

Easy walk to southern entrance to Central Park. 20 minute walk down Broadway to Times Square.",Dewclaw34,2009-11-01,223023,2010-01-28,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“So hip it hurts” I've stayed here several times - for leisure and for business. Upon entry, the lobby is quite impressive as you go up the escalator. Front desk staff wear black and look like models. They're not overly friendly but not rude either. The hallways are very dark, almost scary. As you walk to your room, you may encounter very dark hallway which presumably go to stairwells or to housekeeping closets. Its so dark, someone could easily be hiding there and you wouldn't know it. I don't know why they keep it so dark - is it to save on electricity bills or so you don't notice the shabby hallway carpet?!
The last time I stayed here, their reservation systems were down so they upgraded my room from a single queen to a double queen. What a difference that made! The single queen room is quite small. There is very little walking space between the bed and the wall. The theme of low lighting is continued from the hallway to your room. Considering the walls are a dark wood paneling, it feels very cave like. The bathroom on the other hand is clinical - with its bright white tiling and stainless steel furnishings. The positioning of the toilet in the single queen room is very close to the wall. I don't know how anyone who is taller than 5'7"" could comfortably ""do their business"" without knocking their knees on the wall in front of the toilet. The hotel tries to address claustrophobic tendencies by having the mini bathtub/shower stall open to the bedroom area, separated by a glass wall. The larger room with 2 beds is way more spacious but it comes at a cost. The walls and doors are pretty thin. You can hear people showering and watching TV as you walk by their rooms. The TV is pretty small and its not a flat screen. I expect higher quality furnishings from a ""hip & trendy "" hotel.
The Cafeteria restaurant downstairs serves excellent food, although its a bit overpriced. But then again, it IS a hotel restaurant and those tend to be overpriced. The location is excellent, a couple blocks from Central Park. The Time Warner building is across the street from the hotel - you can access the subway from here and if you want a quick bite, there's also a Whole Foods downstairs which has an extensive salad / hot foods bar. If you have a sweet tooth, there's a Pinkberry a few doors down.
This hotel is not suited for families - I've never seen anyone under the age of 20 staying here. Its better suited for business travel, but only if you plan on being there for a couple nights.",sweetmarieyyz,2009-05-01,223023,2010-01-26,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Ultra Trendy Hotel, 1 Man's meat is another Man's poision......Loved It!!” My boyfriend and I decided to stay at the Hudson Hotel during our trip to New York in Decemeber. We decided to stay at the hotel due to getting a good deal on Expedia.com. 
On reading reviews we were both sceptical about what we had gotten ourselves into!! 
However upon arrival it was clear that we had made a good choice. The hotel was easy to find and every taxi we got into new exactly where the Hudson was located. 
The escalators gave a very chic atmosphere to the hotel and the lobby was beautiful. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. We were staying on the 10th floor and we couldnt hear any music playing from downstairs in our. Upon getting out the elevator there was a snack and drinks vending machine as well as free ice and a table to sit at if you wanted to. 
The room was clean and fresh. My boyfriend and I took 4 suitcases with us and were worried that they wouldnt fit in the room with us and our stuff, but there was more than enough room. The shower was big enough for both of us to enjoy a shower however the toilet is a little close to the wall. Also one of the best hairdryers I have used in a hotel before!! The bed was comfortable and clean. 
The only down side we experienced was the room was very hot, however we phoned downstairs and a handyman came to turn it down and open the window for us. Would definitely prefer to be hot than cold though!! The only negative point of the stay is the terrace bars were not open, they should install some patio heaters so they can stay open all year round. 
Within walking distance to 5th Avenue, Central Park, Columbus Circle and many other places. Always taxis outside the hotel and if there wasnt doormen would hail one for you. 
Great place to stay, would definitely recommend it and would stay again any day especially for the price that we paid.",ZaBam,2009-12-01,223023,2010-01-25,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Excellent Experience... Great Hotel” Well, not sure why many people rated this hotel low. It's Terrific and so amazing!!!
However I agree it's a little different.
When we arrived we noticed that the restaurant became a night place and got scared to hear that loud music in our room and our baby could not sleep but when we got into the elevator and the floor we cold be sure that it wont affect our night sleep.
We spent 1 week on this hotel and we totally recommend it.
When people say it's a little dark, it's true, I mean the aisles are dark but the room clear and comfortable, also room was clean enough and staff so nice
Excellent Location, several services around (market, subway, drugstore, restaurants, Central Park, etc)
100% recommended
Thanks to Jerry Mac and Daniel for all the help during our stay

"“Very uncomfortable, unpleasant hotel” The Hudson Hotel is located half a block from Columbus Circle, the subway and the Whole Foods Market main NYC location. It is a trendy hotel designed by Philippe Stark and boasts a very popular lobby bar. As you enter the hotel, the vine-walled lobby is impressive as you come up the escalator. Check-in was fine and the good stops there.
The room is about 100 square feet in size, comparable, but smaller, than an inside cabin on a cruise ship. The room is about 8 feet wide, a strip of about 18 inches around the bed to the wall. The TV is on the side wall, so you have to crane your neck to watch the TV, but it is a nice flat screen. There is a safe in the room, a radio and CD player, an alarm clock. The bed is hard but comfortable, big enough for two regular-sized people. Our view was of another building and no light came into the room, making the in-room lighting essential.
I hit my head on the hanging TV at least five times, getting up in the night because of its placement next to the bed. That and the knocking that came from the heating unit made sleep a bit rough. In addition, despite setting the temperature at 68, it seemed like it was 80 degrees in my room all night. 
The bathroom is about 10 square feet, if that! When sitting on the toilet, I had to place my legs to the side because there was not enough room to sit straight, due to the proximity of the wall. When facing the toilet, the blow dryer hanging on the wall made me have to lean forward slightly. The shower has good water pressure and plenty of hot water, but is so small. It has hanging fabric on both sides, and as you wash, the fabric is touching you. Standing at the sink is a little easier, as there is enough room to actually wash your hands. There is no closet, but there is a small area near the door to hand a few things and stash your bags. There are also hooks on the wall. The telephone was broken for the duration of my stay. 
I have stayed in small rooms before and for the amount I paid, 90 on priceline, it was fine, but honestly, if comfort is your thing, this hotel is not for you. What were they thinking when they designed this hotel? For the amenities and restaurants, it ranks a 3.5 star hotel, but it certainly doesn’t feel that way when you are awake at night.",mikestage,2010-01-01,223023,2010-01-21,False,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Cool and lots of fun, just mind your head.” I stayed here on business in July last year and really loved it - I work for an NGO and generally get to stay in fairly joyless hotels, but his time my hosts were paying and I enjoyed every inch of the difference! It's a bit too cool for school, but so is the whole city, and once you get over that it's a lot of fun, and New York service is head and shoulders above its equivalent in the UK. IMHO. You pay for it though.
So when I was invited back I brought my boyfriend too and we stayed an extra three nights at our own expense. It's worth shopping around for deals, as we managed to get one with breakfast included, and I had the best yoghurt of my life, though it was a little disconcerting to eat it in a yellow floor-lit club environment. My only real issue was with the room size - fine for one, and in fact the bed is fine for two, but if there are two of you the person who's on same side as the wall-mounted TV (me in this case) will bang their head on it at least twice. You can't swing a cat. And anyone over six foot will struggle to squeeze their knees in between the loo and the wall. And the towels could be bigger, and it's shocking that they charge $10 a day for wireless internet access. But the location's great, the staff are great, especially the housekeepers, and it's definitely an experience.",joellaox4,2010-01-01,223023,2010-01-21,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Imagine a hotel designed by teenages” We stayed here for 3 days and had an okay experience, but would have prefered something more practical and less aggressively hip. When we arrived, we thought we were going in the back door as there was no signs anywhere. Wrong- the no-sign thing is just their hipness. We memorized the location by the 4 trees and green light over the door. Same inside the lobby. No signs, big desk for check in. The elevators had green light for up, red light for down.
Rooms are tiny- only the size of a double bed plus 18 inches on each side. The bathroom has a 1/2 size bathroom. It's like being on a boat. We had a drink at the ""library"" and I paid $18 for a glass of the house pinot noir, which was served warm.
Saturday night it was a nightclub with very very loud music which, fortunately, couldnot be heard in our room.
Breakfast buffet- in the same club room- was excellent. Served on tables so small (about 2 feet by 2 feet) that the waiters brought tiny tables to put next to the tables. We tried the silly chairs - a lot with chair backs attached, and a plastic chaise. The floor has lights under it.
It is absurdly dark in the lobby and common areas.
Location was great for Lincoln Center and the park.
Service wasn't so hot. We were assigned to one room where the floor was coming apart and we requested another room. It took forever to get it together. We spent a lot of time trying to get things sorted out with the concierge. No free internet
I might stay again if it was cheap, but you sacrifice convenience for hip green lights.",nygirl71,2010-01-01,223023,2010-01-21,False,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Dirty and dark. Cool over cleanliness” My wife and I are in our early thirties. We thought we would try out the Hudson Hotel as we had been told it was an interesting place to stay.
Location: Okay, yes it is well positioned on paper but the actual location is a bit of a let-down when you get there. The frontage looks better on the photographs and the overall feel of the street is a bit underwhelming for 1st time NYC tourists.
Entrance, Lobby: The entrance staff (modern dress) are a little more casual than expected and pretty much just pointed us up the escalator. This is your first experience of the dark of the hotel. The Lobby is very attractive but very dark.
Bars: The two main bars are okay. The under lit club/bar looks great but is extremely loud. I don't want to sound too old and grumpy here (I am 31) so if you are in the mood for very loud music then you will like it. The other bar/library is smaller than the photos suggest. It doesn't really have a bar so much as a small table in the corner. There was no room to sit when we tried so I can't review the staff.
Hallways: This is where the wheels come off. The Hudson seems quite popular with the locals but then they are not staying. The Hallways are very very dark and painted a grim kind of grey. The paintwork is battered and dirty and the carpets don't look like they have been cleaned in a very long time. The build up of dust and grime along the edges is revolting.
The Room: We booked a studio after reading reviews with warnings about the room size. As it happens we were upgraded to a deluxe studio. Size wise the main area of the studio was ""okay"" but nothing impressive. The worst problem again was cleanliness. The room was just plain dirty. Most surfaces had a layer of dust and there were ""substances"" around the bed that are best left to the imagination. We called reception and asked that it be cleaned again. When we checked again there were still many really grimy areas. We asked a second time and this time a manager came up with the maid to assess the room. He was polite and on our subsequent return to the room it was a lot cleaner.
The bathroom for what is supposed to be one of the better studios was comically small. I have seen bigger bathrooms in caravans. The bath was about half the size of a normal UK bath, really only useful as a shower base. The whole room was so small only one person could stand in it at a time.
After a disturbed night sleep (very loud, rattling air con) we checked out 3 days early and went to a different hotel.
To be fair to the hotel staff they were extremely friendly about it. They tried their best to keep us at the hotel by offering further discounts and room changes but it was a lost cause for us, we were well and truly done with the Hudson.
Value for Money: I think the Hudson really comes unstuck here. For the same money you can get a very good hotel at a better location.",Skittles_10,2010-01-01,223023,2010-01-20,False,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Fantastic Hotel, Highly Recommended” We got married on the 29th December in NYC and stayed at the Hudson for Xmas, the wedding and New Year. The hotel is really funky and has a great feel, and the staff were great. We were upgraded upon arrival and our suit was plenty big enough, despite the rooms having a reputation for being small. The manager Justin lent us the penthouse for our photos, which was really great of him and the pictures turned out perfectly.

"“The location is its greatest asset” I stayed at the Hudson for two nights in January for a business meeting. It is directly across the street from Columbus Circle and very centrally located to everything on the island. The hotel has a few flaws, nothing at all insurmountable. First of all, it is dark, really dark everywhere, including the sitting areas in the lobby, the bathrooms, and the elevator. I need glasses to see anything in the dark so I always notice this. I would love it if all hotels had magnifying mirrors in the bathroom (hint to hotel managers everywhere). No coffee makers in the rooms and no free wireless. Their Cafeteria restaurant was in the process of remodeling (would have been nice to know before I booked) and will not be open until April, but as I said in the beginning, it is a great location. And very, very hip -- a beautiful hotel with clean, small rooms that are wonderful for one person. Better value can be found in the city but all things considered, it is a great place to stay.",g3ographer,2010-01-01,223023,2010-01-19,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Chic, tiny, centrally located” A friend and I stayed in the Hudson Hotel for two nights while she was in town for business. As a “native,” I had seen the public spaces in this hotel before, and they are gorgeous – from the ivy-draped lobby check-in area to the chic, floor-lit bar area to the fireplace lounge – very inviting on a cold winter night. We could also see the beautiful outdoor space through the lobby windows – though with temperatures in the 20s, it was a feature we didn’t actually see in person. The actual restaurant in the hotel is currently closed for renovation.
The staff, though beautiful and chic as the hotel, are warm, service oriented, polite and accommodating. Joe at the front desk helped us with check-in and gave us a room toward the top of the hotel with a lovely Hudson River view. Everyone we encountered, in fact, from the doormen to the bartender, was polite and helpful. Young, thin, fabulous people straight out of central casting wander the lobby and a few were draped over the leather chairs and sofas, asleep, early on a Monday morning. We stopped in the bar for a nightcap on the first night and got immediate sticker shock from the $15 price tag for top shelf drinks – not specialty drinks or anything, just top shelf liquor – and we are both city people who’ve been around the block a few times. They also offer a $28 breakfast buffet in the bar in the mornings (and complimentary coffee to go for hotel guests). It’s a space worth checking out – just be ready for the price.
Now to the rooms. Let’s just say this is not a hotel for your ordinary, generously sized middle aged business person who needs to get some work done and relax in the room between meetings – or anyone with claustrophobia. Though they are well thought-out and designed, the rooms are tiny – and that’s generous. In our queen room, there was approximately 12-18” on either side of the bed, and about the same at the foot of the bed – that is it in terms of floor space in the main area. There's a small hallway to the bathroom with a closet and 3 small hooks on the wall, good for coats, etc. The bathroom is so small that anyone over about 5” 9” would bang their knees on the wall when sitting on the toilet. There is a small desk, a small closet and a tall, thin cabinet that houses a safe (not large enough for a laptop), an older model stereo (I saw no iPod dock in the room though others have mentioned them), one drawer and 3 small shelves. It also looks like it once housed a tiny television. In an ingenious design move, the two walls on either side of the bed are mirrored to give a slightly more open feeling. On one wall, however, the mirror has a cutout that is retrofitted with a flat screen TV on an adjustable arm, which obscures part of the mirror and makes It awkward to walk beside the bed on that side. The platform bed is firm and comfortable – both of us slept pretty well. The bathroom has standard amenities-soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, all natural products, and three decent sized shelves for toiletries. For two friends sharing a room, the “open” shower was disconcerting – it has a window with a sheer curtain that faces into the room. It provides light and a more open feeling to the bathroom, but not much in the way of privacy. Also, our room had a shower in a tiny bathtub – but if you want a luxurious bath, this is not the place. There’s no coffee maker (you can get coffee downstairs easily, though), refrigerator or other amenities to keep you in the room. There is an iron and a tiny ironing board. 
In short, this is a hotel for the young, thin and hip, who plan to spend days sightseeing and nights clubbing. The hotel’s location is ideal for both. It is not a hotel for families (kids would go stir crazy in the teeny rooms), or middle aged business people as I outlined above.",marmtravel,2010-01-01,223023,2010-01-14,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“OK, but not sure it is worth the money” Bit of a mixed bag this review. I booked via Hotwire - which turned out to be a bit of a disaster and would not do so again - anyway we ended up with Hudson for 6 nights in late December / early January. OK, the good points. The hotel is very well located and especially close to Columbus Circle subway which connects to many of the main subway lines. Staff, by and large were friendly and helpful, albeit in a rather clueless way at times. Not really sure that there is anything else good.
Bad or just OK points. 
this actually worked out quite expensive. Hotwire only give you a double room (the size of a matchbox) and since i did not want to sleep with my (male) friend i had to ""upgrade"" the room which cost an extra $140 a night on top of the $220 we had already paid. The first night they had no twin rooms available but put us in a suite with the promise of putting a folding bed (cot) there for one night before finding us a twin room the following day. It took over six hours for them to bring the folding bed despite me having to ask about 6 times and it was only when i had a showdown with one of the receptionists that they finally brought it up. 
Decor. I have to say this is the darkest, most depressing decor i have ever experienced. The thing about boutique hotels is that they are always someone else's idea of style/good taste and i am afraid that the Hudson is stuck in the mid 1990s and is now really passe. I see now why the chain hotels (Holiday Inn) etc go for the bland and inoffensive - would way prefer this over the darkness of the Hudson any day. The place is so dark it is impossible to actually do anything like read etc., it would be impossible to use this as a business hotel. Very noisy at night from the bar downstairs which turns into some kind of club. way overpriced drink eg bottle of corona in the Library Bar is $9. 
Rooms: suite was OK, but seats - sofa and chair were not actually designed for sitting on and were also tiny. TV volume was restricted to such a low level you could barely hear it; some dodgy looking electrical wiring sticking out of the walls; mini bar ridiculously expensive so didn't us it; bathroom miniscule barely enough room to turn around; really gloomy and dark with faux wood pannelling which made me want to scream everytime i looked at it; noisy room if you get one looking down on street. Room not turned down until the second day. 
Twin Room: we were moved to a twin room for the last four days. Overall, a bit better than the suite but still dark and gloomy. Two of the lamps in the room did not work, including the ipod music player thing; no seating area so you had to sit or lie on the bed the whole time; bigger bathroom and shower; the room was really draughty from an ill-fitting window which i attempted to block off with towels and extra pillows. Worked a bit, but was still cold and you could feel the wind on your face; door lock on bathroom door broken. overall quite a tatty room and you could never be sure whether something was going to work or not. 
Overall, this is a hotel that is past it really. It is an attempt at style over substance, but the style is gloomy and depressing and is just really dated now. I wouldn't stay here again, though the location made up for the general lack of comfort.",corrado8,2009-12-01,223023,2010-01-03,False,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

I personally did not like the immediate entranceway but once you make your way up the escalator you are greeted by a serene, warm , dimly lit lobby that immediately makes you feel like you're in an episode of Sex in the City. They have two very cool bars that are great for young professionals, out of towners looking for a NY experience or even newlyweds.
There are some setbacks to the hotel...I feel they are important to mention so one does not set their expectations too high. The rooms are typical of NYC in that they are very small as are the bathrooms. I also was not crazy about the comfort of the bed.

"“Unique Boutique Hotel in New York City” WOW!! Very impressive! We were completely surprised as we entered this hotel. Up the escalator into a lobby encapsulated by a vine roof and a crystal chandalier. Rooms were small but very well designed and the extra space is not necessary while staying in New York City were you spend most of your time outside in the City. The Library Bar with it's books, pool table, fire place and picturesque cow portraits, pictured with cocco channel hats, were absolutely hilarious. At night, a DJ spins music in the lounge which was a lot of fun after a day of walking around the city. The outside garden is absolutely beautiful, but it's entrance is closed off during the winter but you can still see it through the lobby and library bar window. I can't tell you how enjoyable it was to sip my morning coffee in the Library Bar with the Cow portraits as I lounged in a big comfortable couch. The hotel offered a wonderful Breakfast Buffet. Healthy and delicious. The Chef makes a wonderful Granola which is out of the world with everything in it. I was so honored by him coming out from the kitchen when I made a request on how it was made. The staff was always there ready to assist you if there was a need. The location could not be better. Right near Columbus Circle and Central Park, Broadway, with great subway access.

"“Excellent place to hold certain functions” My stepdaughter had her wedding reception in the penthouse of the Hudson last night. I declined to stay in the hotel, as I had read the reviews and knew that it was not right for a middle-aged couple, but I have to say that the Hudson has the ability to hold a first class event. The food and service were fantastic, and the hotel organizer, Marta, was on hand for the entire event and was very hands on and anticipatory,
I wandered around the hotel with the reviews in mind, and I would say that the hotel does a good job of taking care of the euro-hip, and a substandard job of taking care of the older and/or family crowd that booked on Priceline.

"“Compact Rooms” We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights earlier this month, there were many positives about the hotel, good prompt check in, the room was very clean and well kept throughout our stay, the location and access for public transport was fantastic. On the down side the room was very small and noisy, not much space for just sitting and relaxing. We chose on a couple of occasions to drink the overpriced (and average) wine in the bar and were left very disappointed by the service, when asking the staff why it had taken so long to be served the explanation offered was that where we were sitting fell in-between the two girls sections and they both assumed the other was looking after us, after this the service was not only slow but frosty! If you were in the area for a couple of nights then this would okay but I would definitely not recommend staying longer than that, the tiny rooms and even smaller bathrooms would drive you crazy!

"“Great location, small rooms” We booked this hotel on Priceline. Looking at reviews made me initially regret the decision, but we found this hotel to be fine. Rooms ARE small, but very functional, lots of nooks and crannies to store your stuff. Location is great, close to Lincoln Center and Ninth Avenue restaurants. Lobby is trendy and buzzing with activity late weekend nights. We were given a room on an upper floor, so noise was not a problem, but I would bring earplugs just in case, as traffic noise could be a problem on lower floors. Overall, a fun experience. Wouldn't ever pay the full rate for a room here, but if you can get one at a discount, the location and ambiance make this a decent value for NY.",williedillo,2009-12-01,223023,2009-12-17,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Small, but less than perfectly formed!” Just stayed for 4 nights at the centrally-placed Hudson with friends. Even for NY this hotel's rooms were beyond small - and I am just 5 feet tall! Moving around the room was made difficult when my husband was also in occupancy! You could easily wash yourself whilst sitting on the loo-the proximity of basin to toilet was that close. Because of my height my knees, thankfully, didn't touch the wall opposite, but in a taller person it would have made using the loo very uncomfortable. Lighting was a joke. It was so dark with the lights ON that I felt like the Hobbit and emerging into daylight was a shock. A simple task like applying make-up was hopeless, trying to use the in-room safe made hard by lack of clear light. I would have sacrificed minimalist cool for a dose of common sense. A hotel can be cool but needs to fulfil guests basic requirements. Our friends' room had an overflowing loo for the whole time we were there, with flooding to their bathroom floor, despite reporting it to Reception on Days 1, 2 and 3!! Nothing was done and they gave up. For a hotel of this standard, pretty poor. For the room price I would have expected more - why no shower gel, shower cap etc - where were these basic items? When using the hairdryer-(and I have short hair)-half-an-hour later it was still wet. On taking it up with Reception once more, I was told I probably had an 'old' hairdryer. If I had wanted to spend the whole of my visit drying my hair this would have been fine, but I had gone there to see NY! To their credit the dryer was replaced with a new one, and they also earned brownie points for booking our return flights for us online, and also for the very comfortable bed. The restaurant was undergoing 'refurbishment' and the temporary one was simply inadequate for an 800+ room hotel - why weren't we advised of this when we booked? The public areas were totally occupied by 'outsiders' visiting The Hudson, presumably for its Phillipe Starck design! Paying guests had very little space in which to sit and relax, and the incessant loud evening music was distinct even on the 8th floor! Luggage storage was efficient and the best part of the entire operation. This is a hotel for people who 'want to be seen' and not for travellers who want a comfortable well-lit room with a normal sized bathroom,and for the money should be getting just that!

"“All form, zero substance” Forget about small rooms or dark corridor reviews - those are the nicest things about this hotel where service is the worst hotel experience I've ever had.
Dreadful attitude from hotel staff. Never go there. Zero sense of service - they make you feel like you should be happy you are allowed to stay there. Everyone is as friendly as a nightclub bouncer.

Its about a 30 min walk from Bloomingdales. There are several resturants near by.

"“Perhaps a triumph of style over substance” I like sleek and stylish hotels but there needs to be a balance in getting some basic detail right otherwise there is a risk of style triumphing over substance. 
That said, the hotel was good value in a good location with very friendly staff and some very clever touches. I could well return as I felt that, by and large, it served its function.
A couple of negetive things to note:
1. Room could have been cleaner (hair in bath on arrival and dried blood on the side of the bedside table)
2. Door closer did not work (this is a health and safety concern, eg in the evnt of fire). 
Overall, although very small, the room was generally comfortable, although the bathroom was too cramped to be considered comfortable. The shower curtain was too short which meant for excess flooding after a shower, leaving me obliged to mop up after myself every morning.

"“Bare Bones at Boutique Prices!” The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms were so small I felt like I was back in a college dormitory. The bed sat on the floor (not making it easy to get up); it was noisy from rooms upstairs. For a boutique hotel, no amenities - which would make it nicer - no robes, crappy towels (and you only get two), no turn down service, no water, minibar, mints, no down featherbeds, comforters, etc., etc., etc. Certainly not what I am used to. The heat didn't work in the room for 3 days with promises to fix, it took two days to get an extra blanket and 2 days for extra towels and then they were taken away (we were there 5 nights). Everything in the hallways is dark and bad lighting - think they are trying to mask the fact that it really was a college dormitory. When we checked in we were told the rooms weren't really designed to hang around in them. The only good quality about this place is a good location.

"“Rooms are Tiny but it worked out fine.” I just got back from a trip to NYC and stayed at The Hudson. I did priceline and this hotel was the one chosen. I got a good rate, but after reading the reviews I was stressed out and completely regretted my decision to do priceline. I had one adult, a 6 year old and two teens. I typically prefer to stay at higher end hotels and am pretty particular, but the prices in NYC this week were in excess of 500.00 per night at most places with a good location. 
I planned on upgrading my room on arrival at whatever cost, but there was nothing available. The room was very small, but honestly, it wasn't as bad as all the reviews make it sound. We moved the furniture around a little to give us more space, I bought a cheap twin air mattress (no sofa pull out bed and queen was to small for four) and we were there five days with no problem. You are not in your room much in NYC, and it worked for us much to my surprise. If I had paid the listed hotel rate for this room, I would not have been happy with it.
This hotel is very modern and trendy, and if you are single or a hip couple not traveling with children, this is a cool place to stay. It feels like you are in a high end night club no matter what time of day. Not great for kids, but they liked it because is had an atmosphere they had never seen in a hotel.
I had good service, they delivered everything we needed quickly and everyone we encountered was pleasant. If you end up with this hotel from priceline, don't panic, be prepared for the small room size and then shift things around to make the room more suitable to what you need.",k_hhOhio,2009-12-01,223023,2009-12-08,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The hotel itself is definitely hipster, and has a cool lounge and seems to be a bit of a scene at night. The rooms are clean and modern and comfy, and are small like most boutique hotels in NYC. You have to be prepared for that. The hotel is a bit noisy with some loud people at night roaming the halls. I would not stay here if you are over 45ish.

"“Tiny rooms but excellent service and very clean” I think everyone needs to call the hotel what it is....it is an updated dormitory. The lobby/bar area is updated and trendy but very dark. The halls, though painted dark to look trendy, will definitely make you feel like you are back in college. Whether or not you will like this hotel depends on what you are looking for when traveling. The toughest part of the single room is the ultra small bathroom. Your knees will touch the wall if you sit down on the toilet. Your body will touch the sides of the shower walls. I would not recommend the single room to a couple as you won't fit in the room. I also think the single room price at over $350/night was quite steep. If you are traveling for leisure, I would suggest paying a little extra per night and staying in a comfortable hotel where you can watch TV and shower.",FrequentReviewer,2009-12-01,223023,2009-12-03,False,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Trendy hotel with well-designed small rooms in a great Columbus Circle location” Like most travelers, I scour the web and the guidebooks for great advice when it comes to my hotel stay. This is expecially crucial if I have booked a room on Priceline (as in this case). I want to correctly set my expectations prior to arrival. For instance, I really had to get myself in the SMALL ROOM mindset before checking in at The Hudson. 
Arrival: The hotel doesn't have a sign. Be sure to look at the pics on the website so you know where you're going if you are coming in via subway train. There was a small line at check-in but the front desk staff did a great job keeping everyone moving. There was one very important woman (a trendy I-think-I'm-20-but-I-am-really-45) who felt compelled to jump to the front ""Just to ask a question"" which of course was her attempt to jump the line. No go! Yay front desk. I made a joke and they took pity on us and got us into a higher level room facing the atrium. :-) Score!
The room: Ok. We know. It's small. It's not the end of the world. Unpack your stuff. Be organized and you have plenty of room. Don't throw you stuff all over the room. Now you'll need to sit on the toilet sideways and take turns in the bathroom but....the good parts? Incredible water pressure and a roomy shower plus a VERY comfortable bed. You didn't come to New York to hang out in your hotel room did you? Well then, the shower and the bed are top notch. Done. My husband and I slept like logs in a Queen size which is usually a challenge. I think its really all about the pillows. 
Noise: Try to get a room above the 6th floor. There will be street noise. It's NY. Buy some freaking Tylenol PM if it's that big of deal. The bigger issue is the nightclub. It's loud. Very loud and very popular. Therefore if you are below Floor 6, you will probably hear it. Join the fun or get something to knock yourself out. 
Location: As they say in real estate....This is a superb location. The subway is very close and can get you where you need to go quickly. We walked down Columbus Ave after visiting the Natural History Museum and really enjoyed it. Great shops, bars and restaurants al the way down. Lots of dogs and locals give it a nice neighborhood feel. There's a great 24 hour diner and pizza place right on the corner of 58th and 9th. Both are open late. 
We enjoyed our stay very much. Appreciated the thought and design work that went into the place. Staff was very friendly except for one woman carrying a clipboard in the AM who looked at me like a deer in the headlights when I asked her a question about check out.. Overall a good bet.

"“Happy Hudson” I was very happy to secure a second stay at the HUDSON HOTEL. I was coming to NYC for the 2nd time and if there was one thing that would have made me happy, was to stay at the same place that treated me so well the first time around. Riding the escalator up to check-in, I felt a sense of calm come over me. It was fortunate for me that during my stay, every time I went to reception, Amy was 'manning' the desk. She was warm and personable and eager to answer any questions/requests I had. Upon arrival I was made aware that my room was not quite ready (which was fine w/ me. Would want the room to be cleaned any ways!) and that I could store my luggage at the bellhop station. The bellman Tom and John were efficient and polite. They were personable and easy to talk to. The hotel was in the midst of renovating one of their restaurants, so they were serving breakfast in the lobby bar which the night before had a packed party. It was clean and fully stocked. I dont understand why so many people complain about the size of their rooms (at any hotel for that matter) when they visit a place like NYC. It is a place that should be safe, clean, and comfortable enough to sleep in while visiting. I wasn't hosting a cocktail party or inviting friends over to watch T.V. I just need a place to doze off and store my belongings. The HUDSON took care of all the above in spades!

The gym was well appointed with good equipment and a friendly staff member. The location was excellent close to most subway lines, it was an easy trip to rockefeller center, central park, lincoln center, and the upper west side. An added plus was its proximity to the Time Warner center with great shopping, restaurants and of course a great Whole Foods-for an early morning juice!

"“Totally sleepless night!” I took my husband to NYC for his birthday for a 1-night getaway. We got a good promotional price for our room, which is the only reason we would have chosen this hotel because we knew up front that the room were quite small for a pretty big pricetag. It is, however, a nice place with some funky characteristics and the room size was not a major issue as we didn't plan to spend a lot of time there. The only size-related problem was that the bathroom was so small that my husband (who is 6' 4"") could barely use the toilet! Anyway, that would have been fine, and the hotel's location is great. The major problem is that we were put in a 10th floor room overlooking 57th St. and subsequently did not sleep AT ALL the entire night. Despite being 10 floors up, the room was so poorly sound-proofed that we could hear every car go by, and ceaseless amounts of car horns beeping all night long. Add in the occasional ambulance or police siren and some groups of people yelling at eachother at all hours, and it was a sleepless night that really put a huge damper on our NYC experience. If you do choose to stay here, absolutely insist on an atrium-facing room or one higher up, and/or check it out first to see how the noise level seems BEFORE you attempt to go to sleep!

"“Trendy!” I stayed here this week while visiting my fiancee while he was on business. The location of the Hudson hotel is super convenient to Columbus Circle, Central Park and Time Square. This hotel is super trendy and modern. It was quite a refreshing change from the typical Holiday Inn. The hotel is not marked from the outside so it can be difficult to find. The valet service is superb. Upon entering the hotel, there is a long neon green escalator to the impressive lobby-all exposed brick and glass covered with ivy. The hotel has quite an exclusive bar which can be accessed with your hotel privilege card you receive upon check in. I hear that without the card, it's tough to get in unless you are dressed well. This week the Victoria Secret models were staying there while in town for a fashion show. Needless to say...the bar was quite busy. I myself skipped it as:
a. I'm not a big drinker
b. I DO NOT look like a vickys model
c. I am intimidated
The floors of the hotel are dark and drab communist block gray. I found it very stylish and enjoyed the decor. The rooms are small...yes its true!!! But people: this is NYC!!!!!! You are paying for space!!! I felt the room size was completely appropriate and we were staying in a standard room built for 1 person (my fault since I surprised my honey with the visit..he was not expecting me). 
The inside of the rooms are wood paneled. The bed is modern and comparable to any European hotel. I enjoyed this. I hate American hotel bedding and when Americans complain I think they are ridiculous (and I am an American!). 
I absolutely loved the glass wall separating the room from the shower. It allows for a fun peep show! Also the lights in the room are fantastic. It was fun figuring out the many ways to turn them all on. 
The road noise from outside is awful. Trucks were honking and there was constant noise all night. Also, the walls are paper thin. The only way to properly close the doors is to slam them...therefore loud slamming doors all night. Also, the light from the hallway is very bright in the room.

However, I was there for three nights and they put me in three rooms trying to find one that had a livable temperature. The first room started out at 60 degrees and then they fixed it. After that it was 86 degrees and would not get cooler. The heating/cooling unit blew hot air no matter what the thermostat was set to. The next room had a heating/cooling unit that would not work. If you turned it on the thing would make loud clanking noises all night. We left it off and they moved us to a new room the next day. That room was 74-78 degrees with the heat off. If you tried to turn the AC on, the air was luke warm and did nothing to cool the room. Also, this room was on the top floor and much larger. However, the water in the bathroom was rust colored each time you turned it on. It was a shame because the location was terrific and I really liked what they were going for in the space.

There was a low platform double bed with a foot or two around the bed and that constituted the size of the room. There were water stains on the ceiling, no toilet paper and the window that was supposed to open was not operating. The elevators are tiny, have a long wait and check out constitutes a half hour wait for one.

"“clean hotel would stay again” i searched ALOT for hotels in new york for a trip for me and three friends. i checked out hudson hotel on tripadvisor and there snazzy website! and booked two double rooms for four of us. but then got a fright as there was a video on youtube from a guy showing the room .and said it was the smallest room ever..
 but the pictures on the website are exactly what the rooms look like which is good! 
the room is CLEAN and NEW! i loved the contemporary design of the room. but it is small (they give you the measurements on the website)when you have all your suitcases.but manageable. it is a perfect room for jus sleeping and not hanging around in! the shower nice too and clean . theres a flatscreen tv and ipod dock .handy!
inside the hotel u never know wat time it is as it has loads of dim lighting. but loved the design. at nighttime when we would come back they would have loud music in the bar at the lobby. but u cant hear anything in your room! i think they have alot of functions there. but it didnt bother us at all. 
our window did fall out !!! we put it back and told the reception .and they took money off our bill.
there was one girl at front desk, not the smilest but didnt really care!girl who checked us out was lovely. 
the location was good too. right at culumbus circle subway-across the street. theres deli, supermarket, pharmacy, starbuck etc... on the block. and the best thing ever.wholefoods supermarket was in the shopping centre near the subway. really cheap gorgeous food. if u on a budget! 
its right near walking to central park .broadway , rockafella, time sq. get subway downtown

"“Terrible and nobody cared” I recently stayed at the Hudson for a night because the hotel I was booked for the rest of the weekend (Parker Meridien) was not available for the rest of the weekend. 
When I arrived I was told that the room I booked was not available and that they ""Downgraded me"" . Now I travel a lot for business and am used to the occasional ""upgrade"" but have never heard of a downgrade. I was told that was all they had unless I wanted to pay for an upgrade.
When we got into the room it wasn't even a double bed, it was somewhere between a single and double. The manager was indifferent but finally gave us a larget but still small room. Without telling us they raised our rate however. The room was still very small and not at all nice.
The funny part is that they sent me a survey, I completed it terribly and they didn't call to follow-up but they still add me to their mailing list. I asked to be taken off and they didn't do it, finally I called to complain to their headquarters and they didn't respond or take me off their mailing list still!

If you are from NYC you know what city windows are. They are double windows that keep the sound out. They chinsed out and didn't put them in. The room was so noisy that I might as well have slept on the street. 
Don't be fooled by pictures.

"“Quirky!” Spent 4 nights at the Hudson - recommended by our travel agent. Arrived late evening - I suppose our taxi driver knew it well as it had no indication from the roadside that it was the Hudson. Lobby and reception is at the end of a fluorescent green escalator from the roadside. Lobby and reception were dark and moody with lots of dark wood everywhere. Dark corridor lead to the library bar and access to courtyard garden/seating area (outside). Checked in in about 3 minutes. Room on the 4th floor. What strikes you first is the size of the room - quite small by comparison with other US cities. A white net curtain was drawn between the entrance area and bed area. More dark wood panelling, dark wooden floor. Interesting bathroom. Very small but functional. A large glass partition between shower and bed area could lead for interesting views but the shower curtain and net curtain mask any views you might have. Be careful sitting down on the toilet not to bang your head on the wall 3 inches infront of you! Comfortable bed, but air con noisy at times (but not excessively). Bedside lamps can be swivelled to show a white or a green light - nice. Flat screen TV, CD/radio and ipod docking station all available in room. No mini bar, but outside the elevator doors were vending machines for food, drinks (soft) and ice, all cheaper than traditional minibar prices.
Breakfast can be taken in a large room just off the lobby that looks as if it was out of the last scenes of the movie 2001. Breakfast was expensive - we ate in one of 2 cafes 50 yards either side of the front entrance.
Outside - turn right, is a shopping mall, then Columbus circle, and beyond that - Central Park.
About a 15 minute walk to Times Square and the theatres. We saw Rock of Ages - 1980's rock music - very good, very funny - well worth a look.
Had reservations for The View - revolving restaurant overlooking Times Square - beautiful food, attentive waiter, water $10 a bottle!
Also had tickets for the Top of the Rock - Rockerfeller Centre. Similar to top of the Empire State - excellent views of Central Park, not so good of the Chrysler Building.
Also visited Liberty Island. Be prepared for airport style security checks before you get on the ferry. No tickets for the crown of the statue - sold out till January we heard.
Use the subways to get about - buy a Metrocard ticket from the machine in the subway - $8 for 4 rides, or share it between a couple. Fast, efficient, clean - no worries at all.

"“Find another hotel” Our first room was on one the sixth floor so it was very very loud, loud enough that you couldn't sleep even with the window closed. The street outside constantly had people yelling, cars honking, garbage trucks banging. The room itself was tiny and there was mildew all over the ceiling. That's why we asked to be moved to another room higher up, which the hotel agreed to. While we were out in the city the hotel staff without our consent or presence went into our room and moved our belongings to another room. In the process my friend had her purse, shoes, make up, basically whatever was of value that was not locked up in the safe stolen. When we reported this to the ""security"" it was like talking to a wall and we were sent in circles where each staff referred us to another staff who referred us to another staff, until it was time to leave the hotel and go back home.

If you are staying for more than a weekend, this is not the place.

How can this hotel get ANY stars? We booked a room for two. I was getting a bit worried when the hallway looked like what I imagine a NY state penitentary does, dark, dreary, grey. When we opened the door and almost hit the bed, I knew we were in trouble. You would have to walk sideways to get into the ""bed"",and I use that term loosely. The top of the bed was below my knees. The bathroom made the airline bathrooms seem spacious. Another wonderful touch was the glass window between the bathroom and bedroom.

"“Cool lobby & good location; shoe box sized room” I have stayed at The Hudson before merely because the price was right ($200). The positive attributes of The Hudson include an unique lobby, several nice bars including one on the roof, and ideal location if you are seeking to be near Columbus Avenue toward the bottom of Central Park. The major negative is the room size. Earlier in the same week I stayed at another 4 star major hotel chain in NYC and the room was three times the size for $60 more.
I was traveling solo this trip for leisure and business. However, I couldn't help to think that if I was traveling with a partner how gravely disappointed I would be with the room. It is cramped and if you are tall or a larger sized person I believe you would find the bathroom a challenge to move around in. There is also nothing romantic about the rooms. They are modern, sparse, and have dark wood paneling. One nice touch is the iPod docking station.
 Staying here twice now, both times I had small rooms. This last time though it was exceptionally small. I knew this going in and if price point is a consideration and room size does not matter to you, then The Hudson is a fine choice. If you are looking for a pleasant room with some walking space and / or a hotel that is comfortable and perhaps a nice get away with your partner, I would not recommend The Hudson.

"“Great location” If you want to stay in a central location while visiting Manhattan then this is the place for you. The hotel is located less then a block from the Columbus Circle subway stop. If you are traveling in from JFK airport the subway is the only way to go. Catch the Airtrain to Howard Beach then catch the A train subway from Howard Beach to Columbus Circle (59th Street). Buy your $7.25 Metrocard ($5 Airtrain, $2.25 subway) at the subway station after you exit the Airtrain but before you get on the subway. If you are traveling with more then one person you can purchase one ticket for up to 4 people. If you do this, the first person can swipe the card up to 4 times and the rest of your party can walk right through.
If you are traveling with two people and don’t mind snug quarters then get one of the smaller rooms. If you are traveling with more then 2 people get a double. We traveled with three adults and had plenty of room in a double. You pay more for the bigger room but well worth the money. 
Located next to the hotel is a Europan cafe. You can get great breakfast or a late night snack. There are two great pubs around the corner on W 57th Street (one block away) Kennedy’s and DJ Reynolds. Both are good for food and drinks and a very easy walk. Central Park is just a block away and Times Square is within walking distance.

"“Rooms need a refurb badly - you will be dissapointed!” I stayed here recently and upon arrival I have to say it lived up to my expectations. Public areas are stunning , however it was all downhill after that or more that a fifty foot drop into hotel room hell. Firstly despite being after check in time, my room wasn't ready, no problem I was happy to wander off and have a coffee and come back later. When I returned back they had accidentally given my room to someone else with the same surname but no problem they had another one. Great. Then I checked into it. My god. I had booked a room for 2 people, myslef and my sister and the new room was a single occpancy room which they were trying to pass of as a double. First clue was the 1 bed which was not even a double and the fact that the room was set up with 1 towel and 1 glass etc. when I called down to complain I was greeting with an attitude of sorry that's our style this is a double room. Hmmm nothing to do woth the fact they made a mistake. After 3 phonecalls and a trip to reception to finally track down teh guest manager I was moved to a room suitable for 2. Great. Nope. Drawers were broken and the shower pressure was so bad it was like a dripping tap not to mention teh orange mould encasing the shower head. I mentioned the shower politely to the recpetion who said ""oh yeah we have issues with water pressure - sorry nothing we can do"".

"“Arrogant, Trendy B.S.” We stumped for one of the largest rooms #549. Still had to avoid banging my head on the TV to get out of bed.

Hole in wood flooring beside bed. Hallway carpet filthy. Waited 3 times for over an hour for engineering and they never came. $9 for a Heineken. And dark/no light at check-in.

"“Tiny rooms, but IKEA sensibility and Design Within Reach aesthetic make it work” If you're looking for a super-chic centrally-located NYC hotel experience, but you're on a tight budget, the Hudson is the way to go. You can get in next to Columbus Circle (southwest corner of Central Park) for just over $200 -- a steal in that neighborhood and for this kind of hotel.
You're greeted by one of the swankiest lobbies around, with a lounge decorated like the mystical outer space-time room at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. You can watch hipsters grind on the dance floor (we admit they were a sexy bunch), and the music is fun, but beware the drink tab -- two drinks cost $35 with tip (!).
Even the elevator is cool -- we overheard three different groups commenting on how interesting the walls of the elevator were. (It's a cool metal pattern -- you'll have to visit to see what we mean.)
The rooms are clean, neat, and well-decorated, with comfy beds.
So how is this just over $200? Well, the rooms are tiny. Matchbox-sized. It brings Tokyo to mind. In our room there was barely enough space to walk around the bed, and the shower was a standup right next to the toilet and sink. But they make it work -- everything fits just so, with clever shelving and furniture configured so there's just enough room to shower, sit at the desk, move around the bed, and put your luggage down. So after you get over the initial ""wow, this is tiny"" shock, you'll be impressed at how well it works.

"“Chic Hotel” The Hudson Hotel was a chic hotel. the rooms are cute but a little uncomfortable as they are VERY small. Realistically the bathroom is difficult to sit down on the toilet and not bang your knees on the wall. the minibar was taken out of the rooms and everything is located by the elevators and make sure you request a room that doesn't face the courtyard area becuase you can hear the noise at night from the bar. Otherwise the hotel is located in a great spot, across the street from Time Warner Center for shopping and Porterhouse a great steakhouse.

"“The Hudson is about the Property, the room is just for sleeping...” I really enjoyed the Hudson. There are a few reviews on here complaining about the room size at the Hudson, if you are going to be spending alot of time in your room and are looking for ""spacious quarters"" , the Hudson isn't for you. 
The Property, however, is brilliant, and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. With 3 Bars, one on the roof with amazing views, a nightclub thats open until at least 2AM and a Library Bar for something a bit more conservative, staying at the Hudson is kind of like moving into a very well appointed and service orientated nightclub and 5 star Restaurant! Having a comfortable but ""smaller"" room is quite an acceptable trade off to the properties overall comfort and services. 
I travel for business, so it's white collar by day and leather jacket at night, its awesome to know that when I get back to the Hudson, that the scene is a Hotspot (Lady Ga Ga's dancers were staying there at the same time for the VMA's).

"“OK...but there are better places out there” Just arrived back this morning from a long weekend at The Hudson.I was well prepared for the size of the bedrooms, it was the bathroom that made me laugh! I am a petit young lady but I still only had 6cm ( I just HAD to measure it) from knee to wall when I was sitting on the loo! Bathrooms are WAY too small, anyone larger would have to climb over the toilet to get to the shower, I kid you not!
Bathroom amenty kits were basic, not even a shower cap, let alone a bath robe.
Air Con was a rattling old machine situated behind the bed, which we were lucky we did not use whilst in the room, far too noisy and I can imagine there were a lot of grumbles from the American guests who cant seem to live with AC
The rooms were very clean, a bit too basic, I do like a mini bar ( only so I can empty it and put all my Whole Food goodies in it), Tv was fine although easy to wack your head on. Other people have commented on the ""cabin"" like feel, it is a good way to describe it, however the bathroom on our boat is bigger than at The Hudson!
We were on a the 6th floor facing south, if you are looking for peace and quiet this is not the hotel for you, it sounded like rockets were racing up and down 8th Ave most nights, did not bother me, I was sufficiently pickled not to care.
Although the rooms were spotlessly clean, I did note the corridors were in need of a good vacuum,the edges of the dark grey carpets were VERY dusty. The corridors in general were looking tired, carpet starting to fray in areas, nasty scuffs to service doors and guest rooms doors. All well and good having dim lighting, but perhaps they need to turn it up when they are cleaning so they can see what they are doing.
Staff were all friendly and helpful. Although the concierge desk was always busy busy busy and I am glad that I know New York well enough not to have needed to line up to ask a question.As was the front desk most of the time, I would recommend the Express check out in this case, most people have better things to do than line up on their last day in Manhattan!
Bars were interesting and unique, we liked them all,expensive drinks but it is Manhattan, in a trendy hotel.We ate in The Hudson Caferteria the first night, nothing amazing...again too dark I could not even read my menu let alone see the food! The meal was not memorable put it that way!
In a nut shell this hotel is for young, trendy crowd, I actually felt sorry seeing some of the older generation exit the lifts in the morning, wondering how they slept with the noise and managed to get in the bathroom with walking sticks and zimmer frames.

The service was good. Our initial impression was very negative because they did not have our room ready on time and made us wait 2 hours more for it, but they were apologetic and treated us to free drinks at the bar and free breakfast.

"“Worth every penny. Great design hotel” Great design hotel. Even though the Hudson has been a household name for a few years it is worth every penny. It is stylish, comfortable and mixes an electric atmosphere with friendly undertones. The bar is as famous as the hotel and still gets busy with a young crowd at weekends dont expect drinks to stop until the late hours it can be slightly noisy in rooms so if you like a peaceful nights sleep this isnt the hotel for you. Drinks are expensive but a great bar to start or end your night in. Rooms are modern and very small but clever design tries to disguise this.

The Hotel has an understated sophistication. If you are looking for a Hilton or Marriot experience this is not the Hotel for you. The location is fantastic. Close to Central Park. Close to Columbus Circle where all subways pass through.
OK the rooms are small. But if you are coming to enjoy NYC you are really only going to sleep/shower in your room.

"“Awful. Cheesy. Not worth it. Oh, and we found a cockroach.” I've been dying to find time all week to write this review. Everyone needs to know just how awful our experience was at The Hudson Hotel.
So my husband and I just wasted close to $700 on two nights at this super cheesy hotel. It's a wannabe ""see and be scene"" hotel, which obviously spent time, resources, and money on their lobby and three bars, because the hotel rooms are horrendous. When you walk down the dark, gray hallways you begin to feel like you're in an insane asylum. 
But let me take a step back. When we first arrived at the hotel, we stood in one of several lines for almost 40 minutes, waiting to check in. My husband and I noticed that almost every single person talking to someone behind the desk was complaining about something. We couldn't believe how long it was taking to simply check in.
When we finally got to the desk, the person behind it didn't even apologize for our wait. He, like the rest of the staff, looked bored, unenthusiastic, and grim. What a way to welcome your guests! From the doormen (aspiring models, I assume?) and concierge, to the check-in staff, everyone just seemed clueless.
Anyway, we got our room key and walked down the aforementioned hallways, which looked straight out of a horror film. I get it—you're trying to be minimalistic. Then we got to our room, which you couldn't really call a room—more like a broom closet. The bathroom is obscenely tiny, so anyone over 5""4 should avoid this place at all costs.They put us on the 4th floor, where you couldn't avoid the horrendous traffic noise outside. I couldn't sleep the first night. 
To top things off, we found a dead COCKROACH in our bathroom. We asked to change rooms the next day and again, the woman behind the desk gave us no apologies when they ""upgraded"" us to another crappy room. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE!
If you're a tourist who plans to party all weekend, this place is definitely for you. (But don't have the wine at the bar. Their selection is awful.) You'll also be sure to run into drunk people in the elevator. It's like being in Vegas!
Overall, it was the one and only blemish to our trip to NYC.",143JTKC,2009-10-01,223023,2009-10-07,False,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Style, great location...but could you get a smaller room?” The Hudson enjoys a great location in the upper 50s, a short hop to Central Park and just across the road from a subway stop with great connections to mid and downtown areas. It's one of those modern, minimalist hotels that attempts to disguise its entrance, while inside the communual areas are all dark wood and subdued lighting (too much so at times - pretty silly when you can't read or see signs on doors). The Hudson is comfortable, it has a great, lively bar, a reasonably well-equipped basement gym, and the staff are warm, friendly and helpful. The big drawback to this property is the size of the standard rooms. I've stayed in numerous hotels here, but even by this city's standards these are tiny to a point where they are actually almost uncomfortable at times - you should be able to move around a hotel room, or sit on the can, without bumping into things. A good choice if you can get the right rate and maybe a deal - I got four nights for the price of three.

We upgraded for an extra 40$ per night and got a deluxe kingsize which was perfect - there was no issue with doing this. Hardly in the room anyway as so much to see!

Don't look for a sign advertising the hotel because you won;t find one and don't even think you can guess the color of the walls or carpeting in the hallways due to the very limited lighting.
They call the decore Chic, but I call it CHEAP! Check it out for yourself. I challenge you to guess the decorating cost in this 30 square foot crackerbox. I bet it didn't amount to more that $400.00 per room including the cost of bed, desk, sad looking lamps with lips and window treatments. PATHETIC! For more excitment, you can observe your friend or loved one peeing or bathing from the large window illuminating into the bathroom from the bedromm area. Due to limited space, you can't help but see this if you are in the room at the same time because there is no where else to go other than sit at the desk directly in front of the window or lie on the bed because there is no room to stand on either side of the bed. THE BATHROOM IS ANOTHER STORY. IF YOU ARE MORE THAN 5'5"", BE PREPARED TO CLASH YOUR KNEES AGAINST THE WALL IF YOU SIT ON THE TOILET. I WILL NEVER, AND I MEAN NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN.

"“fabulous-loved it” i like many others was wary after reading a few bad reviews but was very pleasantly surprised. i stayed for 5 nites with my boyfriend and we loved it. the decor is very cool and though the rooms are smallish they are very modern and space is used well! the staff were so friendly and helpful. the bars inside and out are worth a look. and the rooftop terrace has a lovely relaxed open feel with sun loungers and a hammock! only ate once in the outdoor bar, though it was a little pricey. overall a very good experience and would definetly recommend to any young couple or maybe a group of friends.

“Don't Bother” My meeting was a disaster. Internet repeatedly failed. Cell phones don't work well in meeting rooms. Temperature of room was either too hot or too cold. Management was unaccountable.

"“Some pros but too many cons” I was looking forward to staying in this hotel, having been to the bars before on previous visits to New York.
Overall, I have found the experience pretty disappointing. First of all, here are the pros:
- Great location
- Lots of places to eat nearby and also some decent bars not too far away
- Nice bars within the hotel, although the clientele were a little sad
- My room (the studio type) was actually quite a decent sized room.
Cons
- Service is not good in this hotel, especially at the front desk, which I found sloppy and pretty unprofessional. There was no polish to the service. The staff didn't really seem like they cared about the hotel guest's experience.
- Bar prices are far too high - $9 for a bottle of beer...
- Bathrooms are not very good at all although there are decent showers. They're a bit cheap looking.
- Rooms have a safe but it's not bolted down, therefore a waste of time
- No fridges in rooms
- $7.50 for a bottle of water in your room, if you can't be bothered going out to buy it
- Sound insulation is rubbish. I did not get a single night's undisturbed sleep. I was woken up by the noise of other guests opening and closing their doors.
Overall I would say some people would like this hotel - if they hadn't stayed in a good hotel before. It's very much a 3* hotel in my book and I wouldn't recommend it to friends. NY has loads of hotels, many in great locations and this hotel lacks features to make it stand out from the crowd. The most annoying thing of all during my stay was when I tried to have a drink in the 'library bar' and when I sat down, I was told half the bar was 'reserved for a private party'. I'm not really interested in staying hotels where the guest is second fiddle to the public.",endofcity,2009-09-01,223023,2009-09-16,False,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“It s past it and I am past it .... too expensive for what it is / should be / was” Never again, never, ever! 
The spin goes that the Hudson “was” a dormitory redesigned by Philippe Stark into a haven of high design for the hip and well heeled – “the next generation of Cheap Chic – stylish, democratic, young at heart and utterly cool”.. I’d say that the Hudson IS a dormitory/flop house where form definitely trumps substance. The problem with all these sharp, pristine design places is… what do you do when they are no longer neither sharp nor pristine? They start fraying at the edges and slip in clientele. 
I can get the Hudson as a fun hang out for 20 something’s from the world over arriving in town and NYC being their oyster, I get the Cheap Chic, young at heart and cool references … but if it is the young uber cool tribe that they wish to attract then these walk in wardrobes of rooms should be at a lower price. USD 495 for a tiny room with no mini-bar and minimal service is neither Cheap nor Chic to me.… I get the feeling that the Hudson is more filled more by Priceline than Facebook or the hip and well heeled. And this is why a generationally specific environment gets filled by other generations who will feel like fish out of water. People like me! …. people who do not want to deal with a blaring empty disco vibe in the lobby and every night and elevators all day and who may react weirdly to “Hey dude” from bar staff.
Apparently I was lucky, the nice Korean lady assigned to cleaning my room let me know that I had “one of the biggest rooms in the hotel” ..; I was neither feeling my luck nor the love of the Hudson. My room was very small and dark. No bath only a shower with a curtain that did a very bad job of containing the water – brought a whole new spin on the “wet bathroom” concept. It took the longest I have ever experienced for the water to heat up once I ran the shower. Very annoying sheer net curtains served as the doors to the closet and to hide acces to the bathroom as well as a thematic anchor for the décor. The got stuck constantly! Wifi worked well though the hotel web site was somewhat misleading in giving the impression it was free for my room category. Room service was sporadic with something forgotten or mistaken on each of the two times I used it for breakfast in four. On two occasions I had very important messages from business contacts not reach me from the concierge desk to the clear detriment of the organisation of my trip.
Yet .. I feel like a grouch .. I am in my forties and past it probably! (yet I shared this view with many I spoke with over the music in the elevators) ….I know many younger people in the creative or high tech fields who would have a blast here .. but not at the prices the Hudson demands. They need to rebuild the demographic of their clientele here and get with the hip rather than foisting the Hip on an unsuspecting past it clientele… like me.",7DegreesOfWonderment,2009-09-01,223023,2009-09-16,False,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Terrible experience” Well I'm actually stuck at this hotel for three more days on a business trip. I got to my room last night exhausted after a very long day and was shocked by how small and dark it was. I had to crawl around on the floor looking for an electrical outlet which I found behind my bed - when I stood up I hit my face on the TV screen which is placed on the wall next to the bed leaving no room to maneuver. Blood was pouring out of the cut between my eyes and I was pretty hysterical. I called the front desk and asked to speak to the manager so I could get advice on what to do (certainly NOT wanting to spend my night at a NYC ER) - I was 3 times connected to a line that just rang and rang with no answer. I called front desk again asking where the manager was and was told that 'security' would be coming to my room - I asked emphatically not to send security. 5 minutes later two big body guard types were knocking on my door . . .and still no word from the management. By the time, the manager finally called me I was furious - he offered no assistance other than offering to 'see if their house doctor was available, which would be a $300 charge to my room' and insisted I had to fill out a report with 'security' . . .and then sent the security guards to my room again! I went with my bloody face to find ice - only to find the machine on my floor and the next floor not working - on the third floor I finally found some. Luckily I was able to get ahold of friend's who live in the city who recommended a plastic surgeon to give me stiches this morning.

"“The bed gave me a back ache” The location is good.There is nothing on the front of the hotel to identify it--no name, no address--which I find pretentious and annoying. You only know you're in the right place if you know about the chartreuse-lighted escalator. The public areas of this hotel are lovely--the lobby with the skylit, ivy-covered roof, the two outdoor bars (one on the 15th floor with a view), the cozy library bar, the lively dance bar, and the attractive though expensive ""cafeteria."" The rooms are tiny but stylish. The size would have been OK for myself, traveling alone. But I had three complaints: 1. The air conditioning was noisy. Every time it cranked up it was like there was a buzz saw in the room. 2. The bathroom was so tiny that I could barely squeeze onto the toilet (and I'm 5' 2""!). Also, the stylish sink fixtures dripped unless you got the lever in just the right spot. 3. Most of all, the bed gave me a back ache that still hurt for a couple of days after I got home and slept on my good mattress.

"“new york chic at its best” loved it, loved it! on arrival a member of staff was there to take our suitcases which was a relief after dragging them around all day. we checked in the receptionist was extremeley friendly, on arrival we decided to upgrade to the bigger room with 2 doubles after hearing the rooms were tiny. we paid an extra $50 a night. once we were in the room defo worth it room was a fab size massives of space. not lots of clothes space but we could manage. decor v. cool and just look clean and the beds so inviting after a trans atlantic flight. 
my fav part the roof top terrace so beautiful and relaxing after a hard days sightseeing! drinks expensive but i think worth it $14 white wine. all the staff i spoke to were really friendly and helpful.
good location one block from central park. 10 mins ish to time square. little cafe on the corner open all the time or snacks. new york is the best place in the world ( in my opinion) would defo recomend the hudson and would stay there again!
the bad reviews are maybe valid in terms the double rooms being small but u do have the option to upgrade if u feel that strongly about havin a bigger room. the hostel comments are certainly a little much. the clientel is definately of a young hip visitors, if you wants something more traditional then book the waldof or the roosevelt etc. but come on your in nyc who cares that much!!!!",gbh8,2009-09-01,223023,2009-09-12,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“an easy hit” We stayed at the Hudson after doing tonnes of research and trawling through the best deals at the time. We finally decided after their ""stay 3 nights get 1 free"" offer (and I had watched too much Sex and the City - the one where Smith waited for Samantha at the bottom of the lifts after she cheated on him with Richard was filmed here!) and overall enjoyed our stay. It's in a good location, close to Central Park and the subway, and the hotel is very clean. 
In response to all the ""too trendy"" comments - a New Yorker summed up the hotel nicely saying ""it was the place to be...10 years go"". It used to be uber-trendy but has lost its edge, which to be honest I was quite happy with. They closed the bar to residents a couple of evenings that we were there, and really tried to put you off going in with dress codes, clubbing music early evening, etc. The roof terrace though is really, really nice and much more relaxed.
Yes, the rooms are seriously small even by London standards but they are the same across the city. If you're on holiday in NYC you aren't going to spend much time in your room, does it really matter?

"“Brilliant Stay” Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Hudson for 5 nights to celebrate our 21st Birthdays. I was a bit worried after seeing some of the reveiws but I must say I had a great time. The staff could not have been more helpful, including the man outside the front of the hotel who suggested a couple of bars for us to visit. I will admit the room is a little small but who care you are not in New York to stay in the room. It provided everything you needed. The bed was comfy, it was clean (the maids where brilliant) and there was suffient space for your shopping. We were on level 14 and so didn't hear any of the noise from the bars. The aircon was a little bit noisy but it was really good in the hot weather so we didnt mind. Also by the time we got back to the hotel we fell straight to sleep anyway. There were a number of small touches. The safe was free, there was an ipod dock and on the last day when it rained we were able to borrow an umbrella from the front desk. These may seem like silly things but they made our stay more comfortable. It is in a great location just a few minutes walk from the tube and central park. There was also a great mexican on 9th avenue not far from the hotel. We also went to a bakery in the shopping centre on columbus circle which was brilliant and just what we needed to start the day. Along with the bakery there was a restaurant next to it where we had a fantastic breakfast which I would recommend. This hotel may not be everyones cup of tea, especially if you are tall, however, for us it was perfect and made our holiday that much better.",Bex191,2009-08-01,223023,2009-09-07,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Great location, cool atmosphere” First of all, I would like to thank all the reviewers. I knew exactly what to expect when I arrived. Yes, the room is small, so what? My room at home is certainly bigger but when I travel I dont expect a suite, unless I pay for it. I definitely prefer a small room in a modern, clean hotel than a bigger room in an old fashioned, old looking hotel. To be honest, the room felt cosy after all. We didnt have any problem storing our shopping bags, and we did a lot of shopping. There is a small wardrobe were you can place your luggage, and a few hangers for your clothes, and you can place all your shopping on an upper shelf. It is a matter of being a bit organised. The bathroom is small but again, I dont need anything else apart from it being clean. It even fits a bathtub. Good TV and stereo (which we didnt use). After reading many reviews I can say that you cannot blame he hotel for other guests banging doors etc. While in the room you cannot hear your fellow guests next door. Downsides: windows should be double glazed to avoid the noise coming from the street, even on the 19th floor you can hear the traffic. We were given room 543 upon arrival, and we had to change the next morning since right outside were lots of huge AC machines which made lots of noise. The hotel should not sell that room, you cannot sleep there. It feels like you are on a plane with that constant buzzing. But again, newxt morning we were given a room on he 19th floor and no problem. It is true that the AC in the room is very noisy. Other stuff: the common areas are spectacular, the library room is fantastic, and so is the roof terrace. Yes, drinks are not cheap, but you are in NYC, in a great roof terrace on the 15th floor, how much are you willing to pay? I have paid more money for a drink in a lot less fancier bars, so I recommend it, at least once you have to experience it at night. By the way, I never heard any noises coming from the club in the room. Staff were helpful when we needed any assistance, no delay in either check in or out. And the location is just great, you can walk to Times Sq in 10-15 min, and you are right at the entrance of Central Park. Walking distance to most sites. And also Columbus Circle subway station will take you to many other places without having to chang trains, although beware since the subway is a bit tricky and you have to use different entrances to different lines. Around the hotel you have many places to have bfast, so I wouldnt pay 25$ at the hotel. I so recommend the Hudson, but of course deppending on the rate you are paying. I think 125$ a night is more than fair for what we got.

"“Still like, but as much as before” I have stayed at the Hudson many times and always love it but I am not loving some new changes they have made. 
#1 No mini bar in room
This is huge mistake if you ask me. It felt like 100 degrees when I was there I I had to walk down the hall forever to get water! Also, if you get in late there is NO FOOD anywhere. Tired from a long flight, I still had to walk to a corner lousy deli to buy SOMETHING AWFUL to eat because I was so hungry. Upon returning to hotel they would not let me eat it on their table in the bar even though NO ONE was in the bar. 
My only other complaint is that things are too pricey. The food area when it is open is way too expensive. A morning latte is $9! And why don't they offer free wi-fi like everyone else does now? Nope..$10 to access the internet. Drinks on the terrace? Expect to pay about $15 a drink....ouch.

"“Trendy Hotel with SMALL Rooms” Arriving at the Hudson on Saturday night I was prepared for a small hotel room, I had warned my husband multiple times that we were staying in one of the smallest hotel rooms on the planet. I had not envisioned this small. Picture a room with a queen sized bed and one foot of space on each side of the bed - I felt like I was in a walk-in closet. Luckily we did not spend alot of time there, as one person has to be sitting on the bed for the other to be able to move about the room. If you are taller than 6 feet you also will likely not be able to sit on the toilet as your knees will hit the wall in front of you. 
So aside from the small room here are my thoughts:
Pros:
- Very cool atmosphere, if you go be sure to check out the rooftop patio & courtyard bars
- Impressive lobby
- Decent price ($175 per night plus a $50 per day room credit to use in the hotel because of the package we selected)
- Modern & trendy decor
- Friendly concierge & front desk staff
- We did not see this until it was too late but appreantly there is a really hip nightclub in the hotel on certain evenings (would have been good to mention upon our arrival)
- Across the street from subway system, lots of stores and food options nearby, close to Central Park & within walking distance to Times Square
Cons:
- Price of food & drink (two mixed drinks cost $40 with tip and breakfast for two people was $50 daily)
- It is extermely dark throughout the hotel including the rooms
- Room was a bit noisy, we could hear doors slamming throughout the night & morning
- Room floors looked like they had not been cleaned in months
- Service slow at bars & restaurants
Overall our stay was fair, we luckily did not spend much time in our hotel room, it was cramped for two people especially after a few shopping bags were added to the room. If you can afford a larger room I would consider that option. If we had not had the $50 room credit I would not have eaten at the restaurant for breakfast every day, the food was good but not worth $25 per plate.",MrsDubois,2009-08-01,223023,2009-08-17,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hip Dormitory” If this hotel used to be a college dormitory, it shows in the rooms.
Compared to all the cookie cutter business hotels I've stayed in, this was a very memorable stay. Sure the hotel had its faults but I stayed here for the chance to try something different and the hotel met my wish.
The lobby is eye opening, from the escalator ride up from street level to the checkin desk under a canopy of vines, the atmosphere was chic. Although I didn't go into club, the fact that it was still hopping at 1AM was exciting.
Rooms are dormitory small and the wood paneling just provides false cover. The showers were barely wider than a telephone booth. Cheap air conditioning and small television sets.
If the price is lower than $150 (or if the sheer boredom of staying in corporate hotels is too overwhelming) then stay here.

"“A little sad...” If the Hudson were a showgirl, her name would be Lola (as in Lola from Copa Cabana - ""but that was 30 years ago when she used to have her show..."") Don't get me wrong. The rooms are smallish but nice. The amenities are great - but the vibe of the entire place had the feeling of 2:00 am desperation. You arrive at street level through non-descript doors and you follow the radioactive lights up an escalator. When I arrived, the computers were down, so I had to wait close to 30 minutes to be checked in manually. The bar across the lobby was playing loud disco - so I asked to be placed away from all that, and I was. The restaurant behind the counter looked interesting but I did not try it as there seemed to be big bouncers everywhere. Maybe Barry was in town...

"“Trendy is just a cover-up” Me and a good friend of mine are making a roundtrip troughout the U.S.A. and already stayed in a lot of different hotels. Due to the fact that we are students we booked our rooms using priceline.com. We slept for example in the franchises: Mariott, Radisson and Delta. A few weeks before sleeping at the hotels we made phonecalls to ask for double bedrooms, there was no problem at all until we called the Hudson hotel. A kind of unfriendly lady told us it would be impossible to sleep in a double bedroom even when we offered to pay for an upgrade. 
When arrived at the hotel we kindly asked again for an upgrade to a double bedroom, unfortunately all the rooms were occupied but the lady offered us an alternative (kind of strange since it was impossible to upgrade by phone). We could upgrade for $40 a night to a deluxe room which was equipped with a queen bed (which should be larger than the regular one). This was the only option to sleep seperately because this room was spacy enough to equip with a roll-in bed that she could arrange. Unfortunately the bed wasn't arrived after 3 hours and we had to ask it again for 3 times before the bed was rolled in.
Well, we don't understand how you can equip a room with such a tiny queen bed. I'm 6 foot 5 and I don't even fit in the bed, my best guess is that the bed is about 6 foot 3. So if you are taller than 6 foot it would already be too small. The roll-in bed is a joke.

"“A treat for those who appreciate style and service!” I had a number of stays over 8 months at the Hudson Hotel. The staff and facilities were outstanding! You have it all in this cool boutique hotel! A great restaurant, beautiful outdoor (weather permitting) and indoor spaces with comfort that says stay a while! Evenings the night club gets pumping for the trendy, beautiful people who just want to have a great time....
What the rooms lack in space (a single is pretty small) they make up for with a cool, breezy, well grounded design. When traveling, less time in the room is my motto and when it's time to sleep I want the bed to feel like a retreat; home away from home.... I love the white duvets and great pillows!

"“Not 3-star. Great location, but rooms WAY TOO SMALL, even for NYC.” Good: This hotel is chic. Great common areas, hip bar and courtyard, and very modern. The location is great, right off Central Park South and behind the Times Warner Center at Columbus Circle.
Bad: The rooms are the smallest I've ever seen. I thought I was on a hidden camera show when I walked into the room. These rooms are even ""small"" on a NYC scale. The rate was $279/night for a ""deluxe queen' room. I would have loved to have seen the smaller rooms..................can't imagine a smaller room. This ""deluxe queen"" was about 180 sq. ft. ..................that's small!!!
Plus the room had dark wood paneling on EVERY inch of the walls. I think this was supposed to make it look luxurious, but it made the room dreary and depressing and even made it feel smaller than it really was. Well, I think what made it feel small was the fact that the WALLS WERE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER, hahahaha.
The bed barely fit in the room. Looked like it was wedged between 2 custom night stands (which were custom because you can't normally buy night stands this small) and the night stands were touching the side walls.
This is just greed at it's finest. If, when rennovating this hotel, they would have knocked the walls down between the rooms, doubling the size of the rooms, then it would have been suffice. Still it would have been 360 sq ft, but comparable to most NYC hotel rooms at that point.",all121star,2009-07-01,223023,2009-08-13,False,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

My family and I traveled with three children up the East Coast and visited eight states over two and a half weeks. We stated at 6 different hotels, all rated three-star or higher. The Hudson was, by far, the worst hotel we stayed in. Knowing that this is New York, we expected small rooms and the prices high. But the Hudson's rooms are tiny even by NYC standards - even with a $40/night deluxe ""upgrade."" The Hudson is also difficult to find, the staff was generally unhelpful, and the elevators play loud rock music.

"“hip and trendy in the City” I just got back from a long weekend in NYC with a group of three girlfriends. We stayed at this hotel and had a great time.
The public spaces are very cool and hip. Yes, they are dark but that is the vibe they were going for. There are two great outdoor spaces for food and drink if you would like a bit of sunlight.
We stayed in 2 standard queen rooms. I booked standard doubles, but were upgraded to standard queen when we checked into the hotel. The woman at the front desk was very nice and just offered the rooms without being asked. In fact, all of the staff that we came across were extremely nice.
I am not sure how big the people are that complained about not being able to fit into the bathroom comfortably, but one of my girlfriends is 6 foot tall and she had no issues.
The only bit of advice I might give would be to get a room on an upper floor. The club/bar in the lobby is very loud. We stayed on the 12th floor and couldn't hear it but I bet you could on about the 10th.
I would definitely stay here again. It was a great location for a great price - we paid $100 a night per room.",jodapod,2009-08-01,223023,2009-08-11,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Good location but a tight fit” The Hotel porters who sussed from our luggage tags that we had arrived in NY on the Queen Mary 2 bet us before we saw our room that it would be smaller than our cabin on the ship. Too true. The management might describe the accommodation as being bijoux, trendy or arty but does this apply to having only 8 inches of clearance between the front edge of the en-suite wc and the blank dividing wall? 
The Hudson was constructed in 1928 by the daughter of J.P Morgan as a clubhouse for the American Women’s Association and a residence for young women. Consequently the rooms are small and not designed for multiple occupancy. One assumes the ladies had single beds, better suited to the room dimensions.
We only got $1.43 to the pound so the cost of Hudson Hotel food, drink and particularly room-service was prohibitive. We dined out and breakfasted at a local coffee house.
The Hotel atrium is attractive and the roof terrace [ when open ] is an asset. But the main attraction of the Hotel is its location. It is close to the Subway at the SW corner of Central Park and there are several ethnic restaurants in the vicinity. Times Sq area is within walking distance [just]

"“Go for a drink instead” Myself and my husband avoided staying in the hotel due to the tiny rooms, however we went for drinks one evening instead. On arrival the places bright yellows lights and décor make it very enticing. We headed to the Secret Garden terrace bar, located on the 15th Floor to have a few cocktails – some of which were the best we drunk during our stay. 
The waitresses in the courtyard and rooftop bar were scantly dressed in Moroccan style clothes. A little bit seedy, however all staff were very friendly. Many of the rooms appear to overlook the courtyard, which was playing very loud funky tunes – perhaps not ideal for the guests in their rooms. We enjoyed the ambiance of the sky terrace however we were immensely glad we had not stayed there as the windows were the size of matchboxes and so closely packed together, the rooms must have been tiny.

"“Even an elf would have a hard time fitting into the standard room” I recently spent the night here. For $235 per night, I was shocked when I opened the door to what looked like a broom closet. I had booked a standard non smoking queen room. When we arrived, we were told they just had smoking rooms available. The rooms smelled like a box of marlboro cigarettes. The hallway leading up to the door was dark and dingy, run down. I've stayed in cruise ship cabins that were larger. There was 1 foot of space on either side of the lumpy bed which has since caused me 3 trips to the chiropractor. The only amenities provided in the room were two cracked rinsing cups. I have never in my life seen a room this tiny. The bathroom tile and room decor was very no frills. You had to stretch your neck like a giraffe to see the tv on the wall. Sitting on the toilet seat was impossible because of the wall right in front of you. The only nice thing about the hotel were the common areas, it seems like the hotel spent all their money on the lobby/restaurants and built a motel 6 above.

"“Only for lone travellers intending to spend minimal time in hotel” My husband and I stayed 3 nights in this hotel in August. Overall, I was satisfied, but my husband not. Here are a few points:
- Great location: 1 minute walk from Columbus Circle metro station, serving a few metro train lines, including Line A which will take you directly to JFK airport. Also, it is very close to Central Park, and about 20 minutes walk to Broadway theatre district. It is close to restaurants and cafes, and a shopping mall (where you can find the Whole Foods grocery shop). 
- Peculiar decor. The lobby and the rooms are decorated stylishly, that is, if you like this kind of modern decoration. The main complaint we had was that it was too dark everywhere: in the lobby, in the restaurants, and in the rooms. 
- Hardwood floor and nice wood paneling in our room, which I really liked.
- Room is very small -- many other reviewers have already commented on this. 
- Bathroom is very small -- I don't particularly mind a small bathroom without a tub (shower only), but there does not seem to be enough room in front of the toilet, making it very cramped. (I am a small person, so I could still fit into the space, but I imagine it would be really difficult for a big or even an average person.) Also, not enough room around the sink to place the basic things (like cups and toothpaste). 
- No free Internet. One has to pay US$10 per day for wireless Internet access. No wired Internet.
- The restaurant in the hotel is expensive, and the food is not good. Avoid the crab cakes. They are so salty I had to drink a lot of water to wash them down! (As I was hungry, otherwise I would not have touched them). I would say try restaurant outside the hotel. It is very close to the Hell's Kitchen district with lots of restaurants to fit every taste.
- The AC in the room is very noisy, so we had to turn it off to go to sleep. 
- Lots of noise from the busy streets below (we were on the sixth floor). 
- Our room was very far away from the elevator. I never thought this could be a problem until we actually walked for probably 2 minutes (3 long corridors and two turns) to get from the elevator to our room. If you have lots of luggage or small children, this could be a problem. 
In short, if you are a lone traveler intending to spend minimal time in the hotel, this could be ideal. Otherwise, you need to consider the pros and cons.",CanadianTraveller100,2009-08-01,223023,2009-08-09,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Fantastic - Funky & Comfortable” If you want a few days away in New York, then stay here! We stayed here about 2 months ago as my wife to be was getting her wedding dress in New York.
The rooms are fairly small but large enough for a very comfortable stay. There is no need for larger rooms, you are in New York!!
The hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly and courteous. The light bar is cool and the bartenders could not be friendlier!

"“Cool Oasis in the concrete jungle” The chic Hudson Hotel is a great destination. Most enjoyable are a variety of common areas that suite different styles. Indoor/Outdoor dining, the club, the Secret Garden which has partial cover in case of rain, and the Sky Terrace. 
Previous posters have mentioned the ""creepy dim lit hallways"". There was no problem seeing where you were going, and I enjoyed the change from the usual harsh institutional lighting. The hallways are painted a dark grey, so the illusion of darkness is probably magnified by this. 
Hotel staff were pleasant and attentive. Rooms were clean, well appointed, and comfortable.
The negatives have to do with the check in process. Official check in time is 3pm. We checked in at noon, and were told the room wasn't ready, however it would be within the hour. We decided to relax on the Secret Garden terrace while we waited. We made 3 separate inquiries during the next 4 hours about our room, being told each time that it wasn't ready yet. It was almost 5pm before we were given access to our room. The wait was made more annoying by the fact that we couldn't use the room charge, even though we were checked in, until we physically had our things in the room. Due to circumstances, my daughter and I were at the hotel without my wallet so being denied use of our room charge kept us from even enjoying a drink during the time. We also noted other tourists being offered free drinks, but were told this is something only management could authorize. By my own admission, I am not pushy and err on the side of being too friendly so I did not press the issue.
Overall, I enjoyed the hotel. The feel of the hotel and the neighborhood are both big positives.",legalrnc,2009-07-01,223023,2009-08-05,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Location is great” After reading the reviews on this site...I was certainly skeptical...First the good- location is perfect. Loved the shopping right across the street, great lunches at Bouchon. Subway station at Colombus Circle couldn't be more convenient. Staff was very friendly, staff at front door was first rate- helping with subway and walking directions. Outdoor patio both on main floor and 15th floor were lovely. Ok, now the negative...hotel has no sign outside- friends meeting us could not find it...too cool for a sign?? Room was like my grandmothers basement with dark paneled walls and no light. Bed was uncomfortable. I will not reiterate the room size issue- suffice to say it is extremely small. We overlooked the main floor patio and that evening there was a concert and it was loud in the room- glad to leave for dinner! The hallways were dark and dare I say- spooky!!! Would make a good location for a slasher movie!! Overall, since I got the room for a steal on priceline, I can't complain due to the perfect location.

"“Location vs Legroom - the tall man's burden” My wife and I had a week at the Hudson last year. As with every reviewer who didn't pay up for a big room or get a jammie upgrade, we were prepared for small. Perhaps not, though, for surreal small. Not Borrowers small. Not Fraggle Rock small. 
My wife has pictures of me (fully clad and for descriptive purposes only) stretched out across the bed. Although quite tall, cross ways the room extended from my head to my shins; lengthways, from headboard my feet very nearly reached the shower. 
Weird feeling, sleeping in there with its woodpanelled walls and low ceiling with a glinting fire safety nozzle. Every night I felt like Sean Connery in the coffin at Slumber's Funeral Parlor in 'Diamonds are Forever'. The walls squeezing in ever closer - what if I'd offended a receptionist? She might turn on the ovens, and stand by with an urn for the garden of remembrance...!
So rooms, and bathrooms, weren't so good. You can't do 'good' with those limitations, just reasonably clean and well air conditioned. 
The rest of the hotel, though, including the staff attitude and service, is fantastic and chic and modernist and inspiring. From the library to the bars, to the skyline views from the trendily underlit roof garden, the whole thing is just a joy to be in after one too many B&Bs or twee country house hotels. 
Admittedly, the half naked waitresses in the courtyard and rooftop bars were a strange touch to be sure - I really mean it, when we were there girls dressed in a kind of unbuttoned Morroccan jellaba were dishing out the Sam Adams and cosmos. It might sound like a nice one for the [single] lads, but in the midst of a properly swanky hotel it just came off as unnecessarily seedy.
Of course, the best thing about this place is the location. You really can do a huge chunk of NY things from here on foot which is so fantastic, as New York is a very underrated walking city by tourists. You can practically throw a tennis ball into the Lincoln Center from the Hudson (which had film, dance and music summer festivals on whilst we were there, most of them free). Columbus Circle's at the other end of the street with all its life and transport links; and, of course, Central Park and the Met Museum really is only a 10/15 minute stroll away. 
On location alone, it's highly recommended. If, like me, you really need a trusted love one to saw off your legs before you go so that you can fit into the bedroom, then I say do it, just for the barking mad Hudson experience! Of course, the leg issues might negate the strong location plusses for walkers, but you get the idea.
PS If you do stay, one of the best Mexican restaurants in the city is just around the corner (the Rosa Mexicano). It's not to be missed - a beautiful place to eat outside or in, with a fabulous menu and incredible cocktails.

"“No space for the shopping bags and offensive service!” I stayed at the Hudson Hotel with my husband. We were expecting a very small room, which is certainly what we got, but we won't be booking such a small room again. It was so small it was actually a bit of a health hazard. I banged my head on the tv a few times while getting out of bed! The only advantage of the size of the room was that it stayed very hot, so if you want to be assured of a hot room in Nov/Dec in New York book this hotel. Our main gripe was the offensive service from the security guy manning the lifts at the lobby. For some reason he singled out my husband to ask to see our room key, but did not ask any of the other 15 people waiting for the lifts. It was extremely embarassing as other guests noticed what was happening and the same guy did this a few times. We complained to reception and were told that the manager would speak to us the following day, however on returning to our room the following day a tray had been left with 2 bottles of water and 2 apples with an apology note from the shift manager - not an acceptable apology particularly when my husband continued to be singled out! It is disappointing that this incident spoiled our opinion of the hotel as the actual reception staff were friendly and helpful.

"“Small(ish), trendy, funky” Stayed at the Hudson hotel overnight during a recent business trip to Manhattan (cororate rate). It is a bit difficult to find from the outside so make sure you note the physical address. I was warned about the size of the rooms (particularly the bathroom) before I arrived and the stories were not exaggerated. I found myself wishing to be Alice in Wonderland so I could nibble a bit of the mushroom to shrink in size such that the room was more comfortable. At 6'2"" with a decent wingspan, I can honestly say I wasn't too far from being able to touch both far walls...Although the room was small, it was very comfortable for one or two nights. The bed is low to the floor and there is a nice Sony flat screen hung against one of the mirrored walls.
Small(ish) room not withstanding, the bigger concern with this hotel is the lighting. I completely understand it is part of the experience the hotel is going for but the common spaces are too dark. Particularly around the check-in desk and the elevator. Sorry, this is a hotel, not a nightclub, please turn up the lights a bit!
All this said, if you are like me and prefer a hotel room with character as opposed to the standard Marriott, Hyatt, etc. its worth it stay here for a night or two.",probjr,2009-07-01,223023,2009-07-31,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Great Location, and comfortable rooms..” after reading mixed reviews on trip adviser I would happily recommend the Hudson hotel NYC. Travelling with a group of friends I saw a whole variety of accomodation and the Hudson was defnitly the best. Located in a great part of town the Hudson is accessible to everywhere. The only downside would be the size of the bathroom but it was manageable. Having a 6'6 tall partner he found it a struggle on the toilet but it was fine otherwise. Comfortable beds, and gorgeous linen. The decor of the room is beautiful. The hotel itself is defnitly worth visiting. The outside patio drinking areas are magnificent and the rooftop bar speaks for itself. Gorgeous! The nightclub seems quite busy but drinks were rather pricey at US $10 a beer. Would defnitly recommend staying here.. but be mindful of the telephone - extreamly expensive. $35 for 60 seconds talk time! better off with a phone card!",melbournegal9,2009-07-01,223023,2009-07-31,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“good location - good hotel” Was a wee bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews here, however had a perfectly acceptable stay. A public areas, bars, cafeteria etc spacious and cool design. Bedroom was very small - that said for a trip of 5 nights it was adequate. After reading one of the reviews I was concerned that there was nowhere to store luggage or clothes - not true. Closet area is at the door and is ""door free"" and plenty of room. Small ironing board and iron provided in room (saves having to phone housekeeping!). 1 other small closet with a few shelves and 1 drawer. Room also has a safe and a CD system. Hairdryer in bathroom but yes strangely only soap, shampoo and bodymilk provided so bring your own shower gel and conditioner. Bathroom was tiny - but again it served it's purpose! ""window"" between bathroom and room - it's a feature - have a look at the Sanderson Hotel in London (part of same group) to see what I mean. TV picture could have been better, but you get used to it, it's not as if it's hazy or anything, just not as clear as I'm used to. Slightly showing it's age in the non-public areas and could probably do with a quick fix of all these little small jobs that we do notice: bedroom door lock didn't work, however doors can't be opened from outside without a pass card plus there is a opening restrictor for extra security. Room service - no more costly than expected from a hotel. Was informed it would arrive in 40 mins, arrived in 25. The macaroni cheese was exceptional. Pizza wee bit less so (watercress is not basil!). Room was facing onto the courtyard and could get a bit noisy at night, but you soon get used to it and I wouldn't say it was a major problem. All seemed to go quiet at a decent hour. I'm trying to pick up here on things that I had read in reviews and concerned me so bear with me if I jump around a bit! Music at reception, wouldn't class it as being too loud plus reception staff were very friendly. The lifts (elevators) had music playing but again I wouldn't have said that this was loud. The corridors were perhaps slightly darker than some garishly bright hallways you may find in other hotels but I would certainly not consider them to be dark! Breakfast was fine but at hotel prices. If you want something cheaper there is a bakery on the corner (1 min walk) plus a traditional diner just across 9th Ave (2 min walk). The location of the hotel was great. It is just next to the Time Warner centre and the Metro (Columbus Circle (59th street)) is a 2 minute walk away. Downtown buses run on 9th Ave 2 minute walk (yes everything is that close!). Cross town buses are one block down on 57th (5 minute walk). Central Park and midtown tourist area are also within walking distance. Always plenty of taxis outside too. If you are travelling from JFK you could use the airtrain then the metro (E from Sutphin Blvd / Archer Ave - this line you would have to change at 50th street or Times Square then take another line up to Columbus Circle, or A from Howard Beach - this would take you directly to Columbus Circle which is 2 minutes from hotel - or maybe 5 depending on your luggage! - note there is an elevator at this station which takes you up to street level).

"“The best part of my trip to NYC” I came to the city to escape for the weekend. The kids, the job, the bills, the chores... I came to get away from it all and you couldn't ask for a better hotel to provide that escape. After spending a night, along with hundreds of other cattle at a large chain, whose daughter happens to have the name of a lovely city in France, I was immediately greeted by an out of the box experience. I liked it from the moment I stepped out of the cab, a fiery cauldren literally lighting the entrance to the discreet, yet bold hotel. The gentlemen who greeted us, wearing smart all black uniforms, were extremely friendly and down to earth. Already I felt as though the staff there actually cared about my experience. Entering the hotel you are greeted by a shimmering green ""decompression chamber and escalator ride to the main lobby. Again, the staff, was friendly and unique... The decor was wonderfully different, with a wild west, meets Dartmouth College eclectic feel... Every piece of furniture was unique, including the double chairs, which by the way, I saw in an episode of Sex in the City... apparently filmed there... (the affair episode) I also learned that the early years of Sesame Street were filmed in one of the dining areas... (something for everyone at this hotel) The night club area was truly a destination in itself, unbelievable ceiling painting and glass tile lit floors... It was so cool...The room was lovely, with all wood walls, amazingly delicious beds and sheets, I slept better than I ever have in any hotel. The bathroom was clean and crisp and very European in feel, in fact the entire hotel is. When you are in the city, you want a clean, nice room in which you can sleep well...the pillows were better than my own even... The sky terrace made me feel like I was somehow one of New York's elite... which of course I am not...but the wait staff in their adorable summer outfits, were so friendly and genuinely cared if you liked what they served you. How did they get those enormous pots and trees up there? In fact coming home late one night, I was relieved to realize I was close to the hotel, because I could see the greenery from afar... splendid views and outstanding attention to detail. Another small but interesting detail to this hotel, are the elevators.... which by the way, unlike that other hotel...you never have to wait for... the music is just that, not muzac, and the walls are like a sculpted iron swirl... beautiful... on a few of the floors you have access to a large flat screen computer on a georgous marble table... The hallways are dark, but that is part of the appeal... strong, solid, discreet... Really, if you like quality, and an interesting and different hotel experience, you should really come to the Hudson. In reading some of the other reviews, one might be afraid of the comments around size... but what do you come to New York for, to spend the day in your bathroom? Well, even if I had too, I would love it, because that too was squeaky clean and elegant! I would recommend this to anyone and will go back again and again!

"“Hudson Hotel - Manhattan” I just spent a weekend in Manhattan and have been many times, traveling there one is always looking for an affordable hotel. My daughter was able to get me a great price on the Hudson Hotel which has a great reputation. Entering the hotel is a bit tricky because there isn't a sign on the street and you aren't greeted like most hotels but we found our way. you travel up an escalator to another world which is quite interesting. A huge lobby, two trendy lounges, one outside one in, very eclectic furnishings we were very excited to see our room. The hallways are dark and narrow, industrial feeling. The rooms are very very small and industrical feeling. The bathroom is even smaller in fact when sitting on the toilet your knees touch the wall, can't imagine someone who is 6feet tall! My husband and i felt very cramped, if not in bed there is really no where to sit, I don't think I would stay here again. The lounges are very overpriced but typical of NYC hotels, drink prices ridiculous but again that is NYC,. Staff was great, helpful and it's in a nice location.",yogamomsewickley,2009-07-01,223023,2009-07-27,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Fabulous stay - couldn't be better!” Our stay at the Hudson was fantastic. From the moment we entered, we felt like we were in an oasis away from the frenetic pace of the city. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful and the room was serene and comfortable. The location can't be beat as it is very close to 2 subway lines at Columbus Circle, near Whole Foods (great for breakfast on the go) and is walking distance to Carnegie Hall. We've stayed at a few different hotels in the city, but the Hudson will be our ""go to"" place from now on. It has a beautiful and trendy bar (which is full of life especially on weekends), but the room was really quiet and we were made to feel very comfortable every step of the way.",bethpiano,2009-03-01,223023,2009-07-26,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great location, but room small, bathroom smaller,dark lobby hallway to room” I was worried too about the reviews on the hotel, but arrived late at 11.30pm( for me 4.30am UK time). I was shattered. I found the staff very friendly the doorman Daniel who went out of this way to help from the time arrived to when I left. Lobby very dark could hardly see to sign the card you have to do.
I was on the 17th floor which was nice the landing leading to the room was very dark & spooky.(Only noise was people slamming their doors.)
My room has double bed very small room, hardly any room to put your clothes. I was on my own so can you imagine a couple. well for the bathrom it was very tiny & I'm 5' 1"" so if you were taller you would have job to sit on the toilet in comfort! for the bath it was tiny too. I laid down in it & had to put my feet on the wall.
The room was very clean & as for the bed it was very comfy. Same no tea/coffee in the room as an English person we are use to it. The air con was great as 80's which is very hot of us Brits!!!!!
Hudson was in a great location easy walking to places as the subway 2 mins walk to Columbus Circle. This right by Central Park. I would recommend you get a Metro card & put how much you want on it & you can top it up at anytime. Beware subway very spooky with lots of pillars around. Sign post not very good comparing to the tube in London.
I would recommend ""On board tours "" (book from home) which I went on which give you a guide of New York. It was 5.5hrs but worth every $. You go on bus/walk/ferry from Time Square which you can walk from the hotel. I took a yellow cab as so jetlagged. I also went on Helicopter ride with same company it was AWESOME.. Its expensive but worth it. You have pics taken you can buy or not. It did.( You can take pics in the helicopter) I would recommend you going on ""Top of the Rock ""Rockfeller
Centre as much better view than the Empire State Building.(You have your pics taken here too buy or not I did.) If you have children you must go the toy shop FAO Swartz its fab so much better than Hamleys in London. Time Square offers you cut price tickets to shows the queues were very long. I didn't get to see the show as only ther 4 nights. There is so much to see but will be back again. I would recommend the coffee shop on the corner called EUROPAN open 24 hrs & will deliver to your room.You come out of the hotel turn left its on the corner you can't miss! Enjoy..... I didn't eat in the hotel or go the bars as expensive.Shopping is very good to as tourist you get a discount at Bloomingdales & Macy's. but you need to go to the visitor place to get it & take some ID. Niki shop(Trump Building) was very impressive on 5 floors. You must take a visit to Grand Central Station to see the ceilings & great shopping cenre too.

"“Good experience” My husband and I booked this hotel using Priceline. We were definitely worried after reading previous reviews about rude staff, bad rooms, etc. Our 3 night stay here turned out to be pleasant. The staff was very friendly and nice and we noticed this right away. We got there about 4 hours early and they let us pick between 2 rooms that were ready. 
The rooms are indeed EXTREMELY small, but VERY clean. The smallness of the room didn't bother us, the only thing that bothered us was the bathroom. The bathroom is extra tiny and the toilet is practically pushed up against the wall, so if you are tall then you will have problems. The bathroom was the only thing that bothered us and the only thing that might prohibit us from staying here again. Another plus was that the hotel is close to everything- right near Central Park, 5th Avenue, walking distance to Times Square, etc. One more thing that we appreciated is the Hudson Hotel is near a great hospital (probably about a block from it). I had to make an unfortunate hospital visit while there and it was really helpful it was so close. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are going to NYC by yourself or with your significant other. It's not a family type atmosphere in my opinion.",maryme107,2009-07-01,223023,2009-07-23,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Very cool place, great location, great staff - highly recommend” I was terrified about this hotel after reading the reviews here and I would have cancelled if I could have but I couldn't - and I am SO GLAD I didn't. Wow! We had a wonderful experience.
We were greeted warmly and promptly by staff and given an upgrade (woohoo!) to a room with two beds. The room was spacious, clean and had a great view - including the park. The bathroom was also very large and clean. We could have spent a lot of time in the hotel, but, we didn't, since we had plans at a local restaurant and bar and we also took a walk through central park which is VERY close.
The location was fantastic - I can't believe people complain about this hotel!
The hotel bar area/ restaurant/ lobby was very swanky. It is really a beautiful hotel. 
I lived in Manhattan for 13 years so I haven't spent a lot of times in hotel there but would stay here again. Since I am a New Yorker I can also tell you that this neighborhood is a terrific location for everything Manhattan. I know people complain about the room size so I would recommend going for the larger room is possible.
My only very small complaint is that the hallway sare dark and windy and possibly a bit scary if alone. But, still I would take this in exchange for this fantastic hotel, fabulous location and great staff!",akatklein,2009-07-01,223023,2009-07-23,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Small, miniscule rooms....” I booked the Hudson due to a market show we were attending for business. Special rate of $149 seemed very reasonable offered through the show. I believe the saying, ""You get what you pay for,"" applies here.
The positive - staff were very helpful. The interior architecture and design for the restaurants and reception area are very interesting (albeit dark) and the outdoor dining spaces are lovely.
The negative - Rooms took small to a whole new level. This was the smallest, and most oddly designed room, we've ever stayed in - including all our travels in the US and Europe. Total square footage is 160 sq. feet for their standard rooms - same size as those teeny-tiny rooms on most cruise ships - however lacking all the cruise ship's clever storage areas. 
The bathroom was so small, all 5'3"" of me could hardly move - and I'm described as petite! My poor 6'0"" husband just laughed when he saw it. The miniscule tub had very poor drainage and the shower flow was poor. Things didn't look to me to be as clean as I would have liked it.
I was told the hotel had been a dorm or women's hostel at some point prior to being converted to The Hudson. The rooms still have that feel although they've added funky lighting.
Our joint advice - save your money to dine here and stay elsewhere - unless of course you prefer small, closed spaces.",TravlFam,2009-07-01,223023,2009-07-21,False,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Not bad but don't bother” Every single person I told I was staying here said ""The rooms are so small!"". It's true but not such an issue to me, especially when I moved from the smoking room (bleeuurgh) and the only availability they had left on the first night, to a better corner room on a floor above. Clean and cool.
The real problems are the prices and the service.
Room was cheap at about $150 per night. But arrived very late and ordered room service, the cheapest bottle of wine was $55. Had an extremely average crab cake and a not bad macaroni cheese for a total of $100. Breakfast is $27 buffet for badly cooked eggs and croissants with lttle relation to their French relatives. Horribly weak coffee I replaced with two off menu stronger cappucinos which turned out to be $8 each, ba-da-bing and you have a $50 breakfast. I refrained from breakfasting there again.
But it was the service which was bad. Ages to check in on an understaffed reception. First morning I wanted to ask where the breakfast room was and two people behind the counter continued their conversation without acknowledging me, I waited until I finally had waited so long I tried to interrupt whereupon the lady held up a finger to me and said ""One minute ma'am"", very rudely. And one evening when I tried calling down to ask for a wake-up call the phone was literally never answered, three times.
It's also a little too much of a scene for me, and I like a scene. Went to the bar with a book on Sunday evening, opened it to a cacophany of music and DJ noise, closed it gently and quietly crept away. That said the roof terrace is lovely so I went there instead and consumed an $18 glass of chardonnay.
And I have to say, hotels still charging for wi-fi is blummin cheeky these days and as someone who travels a lot, it's one of my basic standards of a hotel and a good indicator of whether they want to be known for putting customers first.

"“Great Stay, great Location, Small but comfortable rooms!” I was saved by this hotel during my last trip. 
The last night of my stay, I decided Im too old for my friend couch and a friend and I checked into the hotel by getting a room through Expedia for $160 plus taxes was $200 or so. We booked a standard room, but one the front desk heard about our ordeal, they upgraded us to a queen deluxe? One step above their standard. It was a corner room which was fun. 
It has a modern design, with cool escaltors, nice lobby with high cielings and greenery. The staff we encountered were very nice and helpful, specially the bell desk and doorman. 
The room: Yes its tiny tiny tiny but it was perfect for two people. I am told the standard room has a closet half the size of the one we stayed in. The bed pretty much takes up the room, two nice windows, clean and nice bathroom with deep tub. We had a wall with a curatain seperating the room fromt he bathroom. Heard thats not the same in a standard. 
The Bed- Not too comfortable, but better then a couch. 
We also had a great time partying it up at the bar/lounge/club that was going on , it was a Saturday. its not that big of a place, huge line and Ive heard its pretty popular to go into. As guests we had two passes, and can bring our friends in ( although at the door they limited the number we could bring). 
Drinks are expensive!!!! 
I say preparty in your room or anywhere else, then come here to dance. Great DJ!

"“Location, location, location!” I recently got back from a two-night stay at the Hudson with my boyfriend. Having read many of the past reviews, we knew to expect a very small room and interesting decor. 
Pros: location cannot be beat! We brought our bikes with us and had a great time cycling around Central Park which is juts a few minutes away and also took them to tour the rest of Manhattan, which is greatly equipped with dedicated bike paths. We had no problems storing them with the bellboys and always had them returned to us promptly. As for parking, we parked for free for the whole weekend on one of the many side streets nearby. It's really worth the extra time searching for these parking spots. Service was great everyone is friendly and resourceful.
Cons: We had our room on the 6th floor and unfortunately the windows are not insulated at all and let all sounds in. Therefore we heard everything from the courtyard party as if they were all in the room with us up until they shut it down at midnight. We had breakfast at the hotel on the terrase our first morning, and as enjoyable as it was, it was certainly not worth the 27USD pricetag for a buffet! We instead had breakfast in a small cafe rght on the outside of the Central Park the next day for a fraction of the cost.

"“A great hotel but for a couple of indiscretions.” Everything about the place is lovely...however our only real grievances are related to two incidents. Firstly it was my girlfriend's 30th so I arranged for flowers to be delivered to the room, (even emailing weeks in advance, no reply) a fairly easy task, not so I had to go to reception and ask for their whereabouts so the surprise was then spoilt, and I was made to be grateful that they'd arrived at all!
Secondly on check out we were presented with bar bill receipts that were clearly not correct, this was disputed and and after promises of correct payment put back on the credit card we were made to chase for the money two months later.",oamsden,2009-03-01,223023,2009-07-12,False,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Functional, nice location, decent value” Stayed at the hotel for two nights recently, here is my honest review:
Background: 
Traveled to New York for business and booked through Hotwire for approx $125 per night. Needed a place close to Times Square, clean, and for a decent price.
Hotel:
The previous reviews were correct in that the rooms are very small. May be the norm for most hotels in NYC since space is so valuable. The size of bedroom itself is not of issue (at least for a solo traveler) - however, the bathrooms are laughably small.
Decor in the hotel is definitely contemporary/chic/etc. Lobby very nice. Hallways and hotel are somewhat dark in nature, but it seems like it's the way it was intended. There were creepy looking lamps on the bedside tables in my room, which were part of the contemporary theme, but I turned them to face the wall and tried to ignore.
I did not try any of the restaurants as I heard they were quite expensive and personally I felt like getting out and experiencing other things. I did attempt to get a drink at the Sky Terrace (15th floor) after my meetings one day, however, upon entering the terrace I was told it was going to be closing at 5pm for a private party. This was on a Thursday night! Not too happy with this, I could understand closing off part of it, but the whole thing? I was actually looking forward to sitting on the terrace and relaxing. Not a great business practice.
Location is decent, right near central park yet not too far from Times Square. I walked into Times Square for my meetings each day and it was a pleasant 20 minute walk.
Staff I found to be very pleasant. I called early when I landed at JFK (8:00am) and they were able to let me check-in first thing before my meetings. Very accommodating and friendly. I asked concierge several questions about subway travel, etc and very helpful. 
All-in-all, I probably wouldn't voluntarily choose this hotel again, however for the right price could overlook the oddities (I was only in the room to sleep). Families might have a tough time staying here with the lack of extra space, but singles or couple will probably enjoy the atmosphere and ambiance, if you like that contemporary type of thing.",TravelingGuyNewYork,2009-07-01,223023,2009-07-11,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Dirty room with broken air conditioning after I paid extra to upgrade” I booked this hotel through Hotwire which was listed $135 one day and it sounded like a good value at the beginning. This hotel has great location and it was only few blocks away from Central Park. When I check in with a buddy of mine, they gave me a 'standard' room which only have enough room for one mattress and no room to sit and no closet for luggage. The shower and toilet is part of room and they are divided from rest of the room with a see through curtain. I came from Hong Kong and I thought I have seen small room before, but this room is by far the smallest hotel room I have seen so far. I guess this setting would work if you are with your lover but it just did not work for us. I asked front desk for a bigger room and they told me it would be an upgrade which at the moment I had no problem to pay extra for a bigger room. After I paid extra $150 a day for upgrade, they put me in a bigger room with two beds. This time we actually have separate bathroom and a closet to put away luggage and cloths. After I checked in to my 'upgrade' room and stayed there for one night, I found following problems:
1) air conditioner did not work, the room temperature was at 83 for all night.
2) The paint is falling from the bathroom ball
3) The shower tube is dirty with human body hair. 
When I complain to the front desk the next morning when I check out, all I got is 'I am sorry'. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone.

"“Very Cool” Great location: 2 mins walk from Central Park, 10 min walk to mid-5th Ave, 20 min walk to Times Square, and a 20 min subway ride to downtown (Little Italy, Brooklyn Bridge & China Town etc). However, there are very few nice restaurants close by so look into it before you go and you won't end up wandering all evening! We recommend Walinsky's Steak House and Gordon Ramsay's for fantastic food (without the Chelsea price tag). BUT of course there are thousands of brunch places 30 seconds away, and a pizza place on the corner open all night (good for post-cocktail evenings!).
We didn't eat in the restaurant (too many other cool places to try), but they have two very cool bars in the hotel, although pricey - about $20 for a short cocktail. The Library bar has a large mahogany pool table, and it is quieter than the other bar, and open in the afternoons.
The staff were of course beautiful and fairly attentive, dressed in short skirts and low cut tops, and muscle-fit tight t-shirts (this is New York!) but watch for the looks - it's such a cool place it's bound to be pretentious. The only exception to that was the concierge Kyle who was absolutely brilliant and helped us out with fantastic seats at MSG for the Basketball (a must - complete with a corn dog and a Bud Light!), recommendations for a fabulous breakfast (Sarah Beth's overlooking the Park), and booking restaurants and a recommended Jazz Club (Van Guard in Greenwich Village) one evening. 
Rooms were tiny - we managed to get an upgrade and it was still a shoe box - but that's what you get in NYC. Other than that, the rooms were clean and had everything you would need (though watch out, you pay $7-$14 for water in your rooms, something we're not that used to in the UK). But don't expect a room with a view! Very ""sultry"" lighting all the way through the hotel - including bars, rooms, reception, lifts and corridors.
Usually we like the old hotels with understated sophistication but since we were in New York, we went for the Hudson for a taste of the ultra cool and modern...

"“Ok if you are on a budget” We stayed here for 3 nights in May, and had three different rooms. We booked through expedia and felt we were given the worst room as a result (due to the cheap price). The first room was dirty, the second had no safe, the third was fine. To be fair, the staff couldn't have been more helpful.
I would stay here again, but the website makes it look better than it is.

"“Better then expected and excellent service!” We'll I'd first like to say that I had read a lot of other posts on tripadvisor of guests who had horrible experiences, but I was pleasantly surprised that my stay was different. I got my hotel on priceline for $115/night, which I think was a great deal, especially for the location! The service was amazing, every hotel person was extremly nice and the front desk man, Jerry, was able to upgrade us to a nicer room because we were celebrating our engagement. The rooms were definitely small, but really... not that bad at all... in fact, I thought i was going to be clausterphobic (and my fiance is 6'3), but it was really nice! The upgraded deluxe room had a small closet/mirror area for our bags and such, so that was really convenient. The bed was alright... the mattress wasnt the best, but it was very clean and housekeeping was done everyday:) We were on the 23rd floor, which I really reccomend because it was very quiet. Overall, I had a great experience, and was really impressed by the helpful staff and the nice hotel room!

"“Very small rooms in a decent location” Generally good hotel, but the size of the rooms is absurd. THe bathroom was so tiny, even a small person under 5 feet could not sit on the toilet without having your knees hit the wall. A large person would be better off going down to the lobby and using the toilets there. Location is ok, near Columbus Circle, but most tourists prefer to be closer to Times Square, but probably twice the price. THe staff were very friendly all over. THe restaurant prices were insane: $8 for a glass of orange juice, $14 for two scrambled eggs, etc. Other hotels are probably the same though. THe room is so small you could not walk in it at all. THe bed takes up almost the entire area. No real room for luggage, small desk too. Lots of places to eat cheaper not far away, 24 hour diners and a CVS drugstore, a few supermarkets, etc. Subway is 2 minute walk away. My room was very clean and quiet, and everything worked fine. 
The ambiance is one of these hip stark modern places. the Lobby is very dark. I'm talking really dark, you couldn't see in front of you. It's kind of stupid but i guess that's their plan. There are a few bars that are very popular and crowded at night. Lots of very loud music played in all the public areas, again, kind of dumb, but i guess it appeals to some. It was mostly young people staying at the hotel. There is a terrace on the 15th floor with some views of notthing too great.

"“Great location!” This hotel was a great find! It is located in a fantastic spot and was great for the rate. We arrived at about 11:00 pm and the airport driver didn't even know if we were in the right place because there are no signs. We didn't know if we were in the right place because of all the people going to the dance club. We checked in and Sarah at the front desk said she was going to upgrade us to a bigger room to give us some more space. We set our things down in the room and explored the area. There is a CVS and a grocery store right down the street to pick up any essentials and an awesome 24 hour bakery 1 building down called Europan that we went to about 10 times in 4 days. When we came back, a hotel employee asked us for our room keys to make sure we were guests before we got on the elevator (which was an awesome thing). The hotel is a 2 minute walk from the Columbus Circle Subway station and about a 4 minute walk from Central Park. We could get to the southern most point of Manhattan in about 20 minutes! The room was exceptionally clean and we had room to put our suitcases in the large, walk in closet. The bathroom was a standard bathroom, nothing special except the design of the sink was cool! The bed was very low to the ground and the pillows a bit tiny but it was comfortable. The TV control didn't work great but it wasn't a big deal. Our room was always spotless when we got back. The only thing I would caution is that it is a very lively crowd at the bar. The music was going until late. It wasn't bad but we were on the 4th floor and had to get up early to go to the Statue of Liberty. I fell right asleep though. The Sky Terrace is beautiful and we wished we could have spent more time up there. We wanted to order a pitcher of Sangria but just ran out of time. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel. The rate was reason enough for a hotel centrally located in Manhattan and the location made it awesome! We could get anywhere we wanted to go.

"“Not family friendly and not comfortable.” Let's start with the good points. The staff was fairly friendly. The look of the hotel is very cool. The sky terrace is very pleasant and a great place to unwind or have a drink in the evening. The location is excellent - a short walk to Columbus Circle and the subway, and there are taxis aplenty. 
The bad. This hotel is extremely loud on the weekends because of the bar and hosting of private parties. The hotel staff was less than honest with us about when the music would end, though they did give us ear plugs. The rooms were very small. Granted, you don't need alot of space for a bed, but we had trouble finding somewhere to put our suitcases. The bathrooms also were very, very small. I was several months pregnant and was frustrated that the tub did not have a ledge to sit on and there were no bars to hold on to in the shower. If you have a disability, consider those points or ask for a handicap accessible room. The bed also is very low to the ground. The hallway smelled like mildew. The room was less than clean. Some days housekeeping gave us new shampoos/conditioners and some days they didn't. You have to pay for internet access.

"“Great position , small room .” Stayed here for four days - great position near Central Park . I'll simplify this into + & - .
+ Good position for all sights , Rockefeller Centre , Empire State , 5th Avenue , Broadway , Times Square , Central Park , Bloomindales - Macys too far to walk . Booked a bus trip before we went - brilliant , see a lot , saves walking, and you can get off anywhere you want and sightsee - make your own way back . . Booked Statue of Liberty before also - need a full day for this - more security than the airport - what a joke ! Try 8th Avenue tons of cheap places to eat ~ £35 for 2 with wine ( I've put £'s in as it was 2 to 1 when we went ).
I'd book this place again as it was within walking distance of all the sights and a good standard of hotel - good disco - need a few quid though .Safe at night to walk round , I'd say London is more dangerous .You've got to visit Abercrombie and Fitch on 5th Avenue, had to queue to get in ! - four floors of disco music , have to shout to ask where stuff is - brilliant clothes and cheap .Breakfast - little cafe on the corner £7 for two of you - mix with the locals - it's great!
- Need to book for at least four days as you will spend the first day getting there , some people went for two days and consequently only had one full day and night and were going home on the third day .When you get to the airport don't bother with the phones for your shuttle - they all speak some weird combination of spanish/american , couldn't understand a word- go to the desk - they will sort you out . Hotel is expensive £7 for a glass of wine , I went down to the corner shop and got a six pack of Bud (£4) to drink in the room -what a cheapskate , I'll say it for you !

"“Trendy...but no room!!” We stayed at the Hudson for 5 days as last step pf our honeymoon in the States. I'll try to describe our opinion in a few words... The hotel is very interesting from an artistic point of view.It's very stylish, the furniture well studied and placed, peculiar lights ( which hardly show you your way, believe me!). The reception is beautiful and so is the concierge desk.The bar inside is also beautiful, with Kartell furniture, a glass floor and it is always crowded with people, mostly well in their thirties, well dressed and very early in the evening,when they just come back from work. The hotel is very popular among stylish and young people as a restaurant and for its terrace outside... We wanted to enoy the newyorker atmosphere so we did not mind the loud music in the afternoon till night.we had dinner at th erestaurant, which struck us for being so DARK... I just tell you that I had to ask for three candles ( one by one...at last I must have sounded quite annoyed for that), because I could barely see what I ordered! The food was good, but we just tasted it, never seen it and in addition to that wine bottles were extremely expensive ( almost everywhere in New York ) and the menù choice was very poor...so I would not recommend the restaurant personally.
Let's come back to our check in. We arrived quite late and tired, about 21.30..and surprise..we were left at the reception where we had a seat waiting for our room. This all took more than 40 minutes, how come? we booked our room and it was late in the evening, why shouldn't it be ready??? At the very first sight the room caught our eyes because it is very ""minimal"" and ""well designed""...but we suddenly found out how small it was.Extremely small! The room is actually just a bit wider than the bed itself ( not a proper double bed), plus a mini closet ( filled with the safe and a hi-fi), a desk and the again extremely small bathroom. I must say everything was clean, but no space for our luggage at all!We had to put it over the bed during the day to walk around the room ( hitting continuosly the tv, the desk, and my husband ..). The bathroom was also trendy, I liked the shower which was separated by the bedroom from a transparent window with a stylish curtain.
The position of the hotel is very good, well served by public means and surrounded by restaurants, fast food, internet cafè and drugstores. 
The staff was quite ok, especially the guys/girls employed at the concierge desk.
I don't know what my review might suggest you, but I would recommend thi shotel just for young couples and people, to people not looking for much relax ( it's loud ) and expecially to those who appreciate interior design. I don't think it's place for families or older couples at all! It's trendy, it's fashionable, it's cool...but in one word it's not comfortable to stay intheir rooms!",Juicy8778,2009-06-01,223023,2009-06-28,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Stay here at your peril” The Hudson was to be the last stay on a whistle stop tour of America for our Honeymoon. We had previously visited New York two years ago so were coming here to chill out and relax, do a bit of shopping before coming home.
We arrived at the Hudson late (11.45pm-ish) after a delay from San Francisco). We were greeted by a mute doorman who offered no help or assistance. Considering we had two huge suitcases, hand luggage and coats to drag up an escalator, lit up by neon green/yellow lights!!
We were tired and just wanted our room. We queued for ages in the dark, depressing foyer with the sound of thumping music ringing in our ears. Unbeknown to us, the bar adjacent to the lobby and situated above the escalator was a nightclub on a weekend.
Oh joy, arrive at hotel looking less than glamourous, tired and confronted with scantily clad young socialites boogying around me - not impressed. Can barely hear the receptionist but do hear that they have upgraded us as we are on our honeymoon. She asks us to let her know if it is noisy and they will try and move us tomorrow. We assume they are talking about the banging sound from behind us.
How wrong were we......After cramming in the lift, which also played music - how wonderful!! (NOT) we arrived at our room - or should I say cupboard. There was hardly room to swing a cat. This is the smallest room I have ever seen. It basically is a bed in a room. Room doesn't describe it as there is no room. The floorboards were coming up from the floor. The only cupboard had a draw which was locked a speaker in it, which was fallen off and a safe that could be completely lifted out!! No room for clothes. The bathroom was disgusting, dirty and tiny. My 6ft 1 husband could barely go to the toilet.
We were also confronted with the most awful noise. We assumed it was the air con unit - it was not. After turning it off we discovered we were positioned over 2 extractor fans outside, which not even the air-con could drown out. This was the noise they referred to and there was no clear indication before we came up here that this is what we would be presented with.
The whole room was depressing, in fact the whole hotel was. Apart from two very helpful staff members, the rest were simple, rude and unhelpful. One even offered us earplugs for the noise!
We asked to check out and was told that we could but they wouldn't be able to refund us as we had prepaid through a travel agent. We had no option but to stay. We couldn't afford to upsticks and move.
We were moved the next night to a further upgraded room. Room in same condition, slightly bigger than a postage stamp this time but added bonus of door almost falling off its hinges. Neighbours who slam door on the hour, every hour and drilling in the morning.
To top it all off, unable to have a bath as plug doesn't work. Not that I wanted to really, because it was filthy.
After a further discussion with the manager, we were moved again for our final night to a Junior Suite. This room is the same size as a standard sized room in the previous 5 hotels we had stayed in. One of them was a Best Western and a 2/3 Star. This hotel apparently is a 4 star - In my opinion it does not even rate higher than a 1 star.
This is by far the worst hotel I have ever set foot in.
Unless you are 21 and with a group of mates whose main aim is to go clubbing and you don't care where you sleep - DO NOT STAY HERE. You will regret it.
These 4 nights completely ruined the remainder of our honeymoon.",CJ1706,2009-06-01,223023,2009-06-26,False,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“HORRIBLE HOTEL EXPERIENCE” One of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. We arrived on a late flight, exhausted we took a cab to the hotel. Once there, there is no signage, just yellow escalators going up. The doormen did not even bother to help us with our bags, instead just stood there. We dragged our stuff up to the lobby/ bar area (which is huge and extremely dimly lit, as if your inside a club with music thumping everywhere you go) We stood in a long line (at midnight) and once we got to the desk, we find out the computers are down. We had to wait another half hour to get a room. Nothing was offered to compensate our waiting. Once we finally got a room, it turned out to be the tiniest room ever. (this was the superior room not the standard room- which made me wonder how small would the standard room be??) Our AC didnt work, and we had to call for maintenance at two in the morning. (it broke down 2x after that) There was no fridge or ice bucket either. Basically a room with a bed. We tried to get out of the hotel but unfortunately could not because we booked online via a hotel website. The wake up calls we requested every night never rang on time, our last night there we almost missed our flight because we NEVER even got a wake up call !!
 I am a former new yorker now on the west coast traveling back often. There is nothing special about this hotel. It appears to be trendy but is overrated. There are definitely better hotels in new york if your looking for a trendy hotel. The bar is overpriced and most of the clientele are uptight suits or Europeans. The location is near a subway station, but being on 9th avenue it is not so convenient if you plan on doing tourist things. You are on the outskirts of Hells Kitchen. I also noticed certain things in the hotel seemed very old and dirty, such as the lobby bathroom and the hallways. The staff did not appear friendly, only offering you help if you asked for it, instead of being naturally helpful. The rooftop waitress was slow and snotty. This was definitely one of the worst hotel stays I have ever had. I do not recommend this hotel for anything.

"“Trendy Hotel with Small Rooms” It was difficult to find the hotel entrance, as it is not marked. The whole experience reminded me of a modern speakeasy. Just a door with a number, but once inside, an escalator takes you up to the second floor where you can check in. 
They have a great courtyard for cocktails (pricey tho'). The concierge was extremely helpful, and the decor was pretty amazing. My only real complaint was that the rooms were extremely small. Great for one person, but for two it was a tight fit with barely enough room to walk around. Also, no desk to work on was a detriment.
Overall tho', for the price and location, it was a very good deal. In fact, the subway is a block away and central park is two blocks away.",BlairF27,2009-06-01,223023,2009-06-24,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Stylish hip hotel, beautifully designed public spaces and very helpful, friendly staff” I stayed in the Hudson hotel after checking out early from the quite appalling 'On the Ave' hotel on a weekend visit to New York with my partner.
After enquiring at the front desk, we were told that there were rooms available, but that they couldn't match the discounted rates we had seen on their website, though handily pointed out there was an internet cafe around the corner from the hotel if we wanted to book online.
We had intended to book a 'Loft Room' but as non were available booked into a 'Double Double'. The room was lined with dark wood paneling and came with modern furniture, desk, chairs, flat screen TV, HiFi music system and an iPod dock. The room seemed freshly decorated and was incredibly clean, the beds were very comfortable and the bed linen of very high quality.
The public areas of the hotel were all well designed and had a modern urban look. Although it has been open for some time now, the design has not dated and is well maintained. 
After a days shopping or sightseeing it was a genuine pleasure to return to this hotel, every single member of staff I had contact with was genuinely friendly and seemed concerned with ensuring guests had a good stay. 
At peak times there was quite a long line at the front desk, but a cheerful member of staff managed this, speaking to those waiting and ensuring everyone was kept well informed and that no one cut in. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. After having such a poor time at my first hotel (On the Ave) the Hudson hotel and its staff turned around my weekend and made it one to remember for all the right reasons and not all the wrong ones like 'On the Ave'.",edinburghdelh,2009-06-01,223023,2009-06-19,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great Hotel” My mom and I just returned from spending 4 nights at The Hudson. And yes the rooms are very small (but you are warned), and there are curtains that separate the shower from the room, (if you pull both curtains it is plenty private), the bathroom is tiny, tiny, tiny, but the bed was so comfy, besides we didn't go to NYC to stay in our room. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and didn't make us feel out of place by being older (the staff is gorgeous). Two days before our trip was over my mom fell and fractured her foot (not at the hotel) which meant she had to leave early, the front desk notified the security office who brought a wheelchair to our room and rolled her out to a taxi. The also brought a refrig. to our room so that my mom could keep her medicine cold. They went out of their way to make our trip memorable. 
Right down the road is a subway stop which made it very easy to get all around the city. I would surely recommend this hotel to anyone.

"“Pretentious” Studio had sufficient hanging space but no drawer space at all. Furniture is tired and shabby. Bed and linen fine but room only cleaned once in the week after a request. One day no hand towels provide but arrived after a phone request which is more than can be said for a light bulb which I asked to be replaced on Thursday and again Sunday - then gave up. The whole place is dark so the light bulb would have been helpful. Only one electric socket worked and no sound on most of the TV channels. Handy for subway without having to change.

"“Horribly odd experience” We arrived at the Hudson excited for our New York adventure to begin. We checked in without any problems, and the staff were relatively polite. We got on the elevators which seem abnormally small only to get to our hallway which was dark, dirty and a little scary. The carpets seemed old and there was a weird stench in the hallways. It was a scene straight out of a cheap horror film - I was waiting for someone to jump out and start chasing us (that feeling never went away). We got to our room and opened the door only to find that it was TINY. The entry ""hall"" was not even the width of our luggage and we had to move them in sideways to get them in the door. The bed was extremely low to the ground, close to the walls on both sides, and not particularly comfortable. There was one small table in the room that we had to move to the closet to be able to accomodate our stuff. The bed faced the bathroom, which enabled you to literally see (thanks to a glass wall) the other person in the shower and in the bathroom itself. The bathroom was so small I could almost turn on the water in the shower, use the toilet, and brush my teeth simultaneously (not even an exaggeration). My husband and I could not fit in the bathroom at the same time. My husband, who is 6'2, had to use the toilet sitting sideways because his knees would hit the wall in front of him - it accomodated me but I'm only 5'2. It was SUPER loud and noisy at night and we had trouble getting to sleep at night. I guess it's a big party place sooooo the party happened just as we were retiring for the night from our long day out. Air conditioner sounded like a swamp cooler in that small room. 
The positives were that it was conveniently located and had easy access to the subway. Staff was accomodating when our flight was delayed and held our room/reservation. 
I'm sure this is just a hip new atmosphere I'm not familiar with, but I'd never stay there again.",jw2222,2008-07-01,223023,2009-06-18,False,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The nightclub is always going strong, the outdoor terrace is cozy, and the Library bar is the perfect place to sit and talk. You can't go wrong being this close to Central Park.

"“Highly recommended” I visited the Hudson Hotel with my girlfriend at the beginning of June. The rooms are small, but extremely comfortable. With all the horror stories I've heard about dirty hotel rooms in NYC- the Hudson was such a relief, the room is incredibly clean and well maintained.
The Hudson Bar was such an amazing place to hang out in the evening, it's a really upscale night club with great music, drinks, and the atmosphere is really unbeatable. The ambiance of the entire hotel is just one of a kind and you come to appreciate it really fast.
The hotel is really trendy, and if even for a couple days- it really makes you feel like a celebrity or someone special.

"“Maybe I just got relatively lucky” I stayed at the Hudson last weekend for 3 nights. Before I booked this hotel, I read about other people's experiences on Tripadvisor (good and bad), but I was staying there alone so the idea of being in a small room didn't concern me, especially as I knew that I wasn't planning to spend a lot of time in the room. Also, I got what I considered to be a relatively good rate, so I figured I'd give it a try.
The lobby is impressive, and the girl who processed my check-in was efficient and very friendly. 
When I got to my room on the 12th floor, I was pleasantly surprised. (By the way, yes, the corridors are dimly lit but they're not so dark that you can't see where you're going - unless you have glaucoma, possibly.) In my room, there was plenty of floor-space around the decent-sized bed, and room for a desk and chair. There was also enough space to store my suitcase. The room was clean, and the bedding and towels were of good quality.
There was a dock for my i-pod, which was a nice addition. The air-conditioning worked well - it was rather loud, but I found that I didn't need to keep it on overnight, so it didn't affect my ability to get to sleep. So, yes, the room was small but it didn't feel claustrophobic.
The bathroom was much bigger than I'd been expecting - there was a bathtub/shower, and it was twice the size of the bathroom I'd had when I stayed at the Algonquin earlier this year. Also, the bathing products were lovely, although a shower cap would have been a useful addition.
The bars in the hotel are busy and loud, and the action goes on until late. I didn't fancy the very loud and funky bar, although I would have liked to have had a drink in the Library Bar, but it was too busy and there wasn't room on the night when I looked in.
The only negative event I can report was when I went to have a drink in the open-air courtyard bar. It's a good space, and a nice place to sit and enjoy a drink if the weather's good (in theory...) It took me 10 minutes to attract the attention of a waiter. I asked him if I could have a Bombay Sapphire and tonic - he just shrugged his shoulders and said what sounded like, ""I don't know"" and then he said something unintelligible. (Perhaps he wasn't a waiter - just someone who was passing my table, dressed as a waiter...) Anyway, after about 15 minutes, no sign of any drink, although the faux-waiter was still wandering around, looking useless. So, I placed my order again with a waitress, and got the drink I'd asked for. A little later, I asked the waitress for the check. She went away... and didn't bother to bring me anything. After 15 minutes of waiting, I grabbed a passing waiter and told him I'd asked for the check - he said he'd sort it out. He came back and said, ""The waitress will bring your check over in a moment."" A further 10 minutes passed and that waiter eventually brought me the check. So, frankly, to have to wait 25 minutes for someone to bring the check is just rubbish - especially when they're charging $15 for a gin tonic.
So, that was frustrating and annoying, but other than that I didn't really have much to do with the staff, as I was only using the hotel as a place to sleep. Everyone else I dealt with, I have to say, was pleasant and efficient.
Given that other people on this site have been outraged by the size of the bedrooms and bathrooms at the Hudson, I wonder if I just got very lucky, because I didn't have any problems with my room at all.

"“boutique hotel needing a touch-up” I just stayed at the Hudson over this past weekend. Loved the minimalist entry with no exterior signage and escalator up to check-in. Lots of brick and wood which made it very dark. Curved brick on the corners with a brass statuettes on top - cool detail. You could tell Starck and the designers were trying to create a feel and mood. But it does need touching up in paint and lighting in some areas. It looks like the novelty might getting a little old.
The check-in could be more efficient. Waited in a long line and the room wasn't ready. After coming back to get the room and waited in a longer line, we got our room. The room was on the 5th floor which probably was (or still is) a smokers floor. We were in the shoebox room for 30 minutes and my wife had to call to change rooms. We then moved downstairs to a larger room which was at the end of a 1/4 mile walk around 3 hallways. Other than these room issues, we really didn't have a problem. The shoebox room was the same in other reviews - shower curtains, no leg room on toilet. Both rooms had wood paneling and flooring.
The 2nd floor courtyard had a great outdoor patio with bar. You could tell that this was a neighborhood hangout. Lots of people that just came to party on a Sat. night. But who drinks $16 martinis?? We did on our last night. And the 17th floor roof deck had a great view down 9th Ave and 57th and 58th. Wished we took advantage of that deck.",DocBrass,2009-06-01,223023,2009-06-12,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“The worst hotel I have had the misery to experience almost anywhere.” This hotel was so bad that my wife and I woke at 4am, called another hotel made a reservation and had moved there by 6:30am.
The rooms are absurdly small. The first room we were given was almost completely filled by an ordinary queen bed. (Side to side and end to end, one could just get down either side.) The bedroom looked, through a window, into the toilet (very chummy). We insisted on a move to a larger room and were given the largest. It was slightly longer than the first, a console table acted as a desk and cables trailed across the space behind the chair where one had to walk to get to the window.
The aircon did not work, made a lot of noise but no cooling. One window could theoretically be opened but the sash was broken so I propped it open with one of the amenity boxes.
The corridors are narrow, painted black or dark brown (impossible to tell) and lit by dim strip lights above the room doors. The person who showed us to the second room could not read the room numbers sign and sighed in frustration. The entire hotel is dark, even the reception. The room corridors are cave like. 
When I checked in I was kept waiting for quite a long time even though two desk staff were not dealing with clients but fiddling with their computers.
When we checked out (admittedly 6am) the desk clerk could not give us a bill. We had to trust that the charges would be correct. They were.
My guess is that this building was originally a public housing project. The windows at least have not been renewed from the original construction. My impression was that the building has had a cheap conversion. 
The staff were indifferent, some gave the impression they did not want to be there.

"“Falling apart” I read some not great reviews about this hotel before coming here, but was familiar with it's reputation and Philippe Starck design and had wanted to stay here. In general, the internet is full of haters, so I always take everything with a grain of salt. However, in the case of the Hudson Hotel, now I know! The lobby and the ""park""/bar and the restaurant are beautifully designed. Everyone complained in their reviews of the service, but that's been perfectly fine. However, the place is just not clean and the decor super cheap and shabby. And old enough that everything is scratched and worn or falling apart. There were dirty bar glasses lining the hallway. The halls are filthy. The paint job apalling. No proper ironing board. The sink is clogged, the outlet doesnt work and my door wont close properly because of a faulty deadbolt (ie: i couldnt leave because the door literally wouldn't close!) I switched rooms once so I'm not sure i want to bother again. The dust is so bad its bothering my allergies. Small is normal in nyc but i dont love having to awkwardly move around the bathroom door to close it. The price i got on expedia is good but i wont stay here again. Also, beware the beds are teeny tiny. if there's more than one of you, you'll absolutely have to pay to upgrade. They squeak terribly too and are crazy thin mattresses.

"“Not very impressed with service to say the least” I and three girlfriends stayed at the Hudson Hotel April 1 to April 5, and this was not the pleasant experience it should have been.
During our first night in the hotel, we were woken up at 3.30 am by noise coming from the pipes. This continued all morning, meaning that we practically did not get any sleep from 3:30 onwards. We told the reception desk next morning, and they said that they were aware of the problem and that they would do something about it. Nothing happened.
The next night it was the same. Again, we asked the reception to do something about it, we were told that they were working on it but nothing happened. The third time we complained we were finally offered a new room. We had to pack everything from our room ourselves, as the bell boy otherwise ”wouldn’t move our stuff”.
We finally got a new room, and the receptionist ensured us that this was a quiet room. It was – until an aircon generator outside our window started making noise, which went on throughout the night. This noise was actually worse than the noise coming from the pipes! The aircon generator was on every night, meaning that we did not sleep well in this room either. We told the reception this, but simply couldn’t spend more time packing, unpacking and getting a new room.
When we had the first shower in the new room, we discovered that the drainage was blocked, meaning that the entire bathroom was flooded. We then decided to speak to the manager. He gave us another room which we could use for showering (we couldn’t be moved to this room as it was only a double room), and told housekeeping to clean up the mess in the bathroom. This was at 7pm in the afternoon. We left for dinner around 8, where we asked the reception to make sure that 1) the bathroom was cleaned, 2) that we had two extra duvets when we came home. We saw the receptionist write this down.
When we came back from dinner around midnight, the bathroom was not cleaned and we didn’t have extra duvets. Again, we asked to speak with a manager, but regardless we had to wait 1½ hour for the bathroom to be cleaned and the housekeeping to provide us with extra duvets. When the duvets finally arrived, we had to put on the bed sheets ourselves. We sat in the hotel bar waiting, but weren’t offered anything to drink, snacks etc. – we had to buy those ourselves. Also the manager on duty did not really seem to care about the problem and was actually a bit rude. 
The next day, when we came home in the afternoon, the duvets were removed. We called the reception and asked them to bring back the duvets. Afterwards we got a very rude call from housekeeping, insisting that we should have told them or left a note that we wanted to keep the duvets and now it was a problem for them to give us new duvets. We had to tell them quite bluntly that this was not our problem and they would have to fix it.
We were promised a compensation of two nights for all the hassle we had been through, but when the bill arrived we were only given one night. We had to discuss this (again) with a manager, as no-one apparently bothered to write these things down. What I don’t get is that we spoke with the receptionists almost daily – and yet, it was like no-one had ever heard about the many problems we had with our room(s) when we approached them! Unless it is common that all guests have a multitude of problems, I would assume that when we said our room number the receptionists would be extra aware to ensure that future requests went as smooth as possible, given all the problems that we’d already had.
The final straw was the bell boy, who offered to find us a cab big enough for four. He did that and we told him several times that we were going to Newark. He talked to the cab driver, and we got into the cab. After a while we started to wonder which direction the cab driver was taking us and asked him. He then tells us that he was instructed to go to JFK!
All in all, we spent time every day debating something with receptionists, housekeeping, or a manager. We probably spoke with 10-15 different people during our 5-day stay - including 5 different managers! Only two of the managers and one of the receptionists listened to our complaints, the rest looked like they couldn’t be bothered. It simply can’t be right that we had to spend so much time asking for basic things that could have been fixed in a very short time. I don’t think it ever happened that we got what we asked for the first time around – we usually had to approach the reception 3-4 times, and/or ask to speak with a manager, before anything happened.
One of us have stayed at the Hudson Hotel once before and was very happy with her stay back then. But frankly, after this experience I doubt that any of us would want to stay at the Hudson Hotel again.

"“Impractical and tiny rooms” Impractical because there was no free power point anywhere in the room, and certainly not at the small table. or 'desk', where one might want to sit with a computer. I had to unplug something to charge my phone or computer.
The room itself is, as has been described before, tiny and the bathroom is on an even smaller scale. The wood panelling on every wall gives the feeling somewhat of being inside a coffin. (I imagine.) I could sit on the double bed and reach out and touch a wall in any direction! The shower is over a bath which isn't even full size. The ironing board is a child-size folding platform, not a proper ironing board, and its cover was worn and dirty.
There were no curtains/drapes at the window, only a venetian blind which was ineffective at blocking light. There was a fault with the seal of the window, which maintenance did attempt to fix, but there remained a gap which leaked both cold air and, more importantly, noise from the street below.

Now, I can understand certain establishments having a dress code, but this is the Hudson Hotel, not 1 Oak, not Tenjune, and certainly not fancy by any means. Further, she wasn't dressed sloppy or unprofessional. And what really made me upset was that there were several other girls in the bar area wearing flip flops.

"“Past its prime, terrible front desk staff, check-in was a nightmare” Stayed here on a June 6th given I had plans to to go to dinner and see a show. The Hudson seemed beat up to me. The finishes, the furniture -- all seemed beat up and tired. What was trendy early this decade just looks threadbare now. Tried to check-in at about 4 pm and told the room wasnt ready...huh?...and this was after waiting in a line for 30 minutes. So went to the bar for a drink (watered down, the most expensive glasses of juice I've ever had. If a drink is approaching $20, you can at least put some booze in it.) Anyway, called back the number on the card they gave me and was told my room was ready....a Deluxe King that I had booked directly on their site. Went back inside, and after waiting again in the 30 minute line at the front desk, was told that the King Deluxe wasnt ready but that the Queen Deluxe was. Since I had dinner reservations, I couldnt argue too hard, and asked if there was a lower rate for the smaller room. Nope! According to the front desk staff, both rooms are the same class.....ok, whatever. Also asked explicitly to be away from an elevator, and where was I placed, at the room closest to the elevator bank.

"“Average” We stayed here for our 2nd part of our honeymoon. Coming from an amazing hotel in Vegas to the Hudson was a complete let down. The whole room (inc bathroom) was the size of our bathroom in Vegas - no joke! However, I had been warned of the room sizes in NYC so I tried to get over this.
Once I got over this disappointment, it started to grow on me though. I still don't know whether I would stay here again but overall it wasn't too bad. The smell of smoke in the hallway and also in the room was horrible and we also had some kind of generator outside our room window which was very loud. Also as we were only on the 5th floor the noise from the bars below was really bad a few nights so if you are looking for a good sleep it is probably not the best place to stay for you.
The location of this hotel couldn't be better, this was probably my favourite thing about the Hudson. It was so handy for lots of places.
It could be doing with a lot more lighting as I hated the dark reception areas and even the room was dark. I like a nice bright room, I found it a bit depressing going from the nice weather outside into a dark hotel.

"“Great location, typical NYC size room, would stay again!” I have to say that when I first booked this trip through Priceline 'pick your own price' and then checked reviews on it I was really nervous b/c of all the negative reviews. So I'm happy to report that I actually enjoyed the hotel a lot! Below are the pros and cons I found. If you want to message me any other questions I'm always happy to answer! Oh and I was traveling this time with my little brother who is 14 so I have both the adult and child point of view!
Pros: 
*GREAT LOCATION! This is the spot to be in my mind! You are a block away from Central Park, a few blocks from Times Square and just a great spot!!! 
*People complained about the noise but I didn't hear anything at all and I'm a light sleeper. We were on the 12th floor so maybe that helped but it was fine by me. 
*Very helpful staff - always willing to give recommendations and just helpful overall. 
*Nice main areas - terrace, library etc.
*Again I can't say enough about how great this location was...we were literally in our room from 2am -8am every night, so really for such a short amount of time, who cares about anything else??? 
Cons:
*Ok, the room is small there is no lie about that - but it's NYC...really what do you expect in this price range and at this location. For us the room was a fine size, but I do think keeping the room and your stuff neat and orderly helps.
*Bathroom is really ackward b/c there is a window in the shower to the room - they have drapes so someone can't see you shower but it's still weird 
*A few times when we needed something from housekeeping it took longer then I'd like but we did always eventually get what we requested. 
I would highly recommend going to Pinkberry for snacks or a quick lunch - it's literally down the street from the hotel. Check out their website - it's frozen yo with great toppings etc...hard to explain but a great NYC thing. Also the BEST meal we had of the whole trip was at Mia Dona at 206 E. 58th Street (so just down the street from the hotel but on the East side). We loved this place, it was very resonable and a ton of locals were there so you know that's a good sign! Highly recommend!!! Otherwise just enjoy the city and get your sleep at the hotel. I really did enjoy this hotel and would stay here again.",cms531,2010-04-01,223023,2010-04-08,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Swanky and stylish” I stayed here with some friends over Thanksgiving weekend. It was a very trendy place with very modern decor. The bar area really gets hopping at night. You can't beat the location either. For a New York hotel, it also was surprisingly quiet. Servicewise, employees were a bit standoffish, but we found our needs met without any problems. It's pricey, but about average for the city.

"“Tiny bathrooms” The bathroom was so small I had to sit 'side-saddle' on the loo - also had to somehow launch myself over it to use the shower. Not the end of the world though, the room in general was okay.
Hotel in general looks a bit worn and scuffed. We also had a leak under our sink which we reported to the front desk - but apparently it wasn't bad enough as nothing was done about it. Again, no biggy, we just put the bin underneath it to catch the drips.
Pretty reasonably priced for the location but I'm not sure I'd rush to stay there again.",peteflondon,2010-04-01,223023,2010-04-08,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Cockroach! Need I say more?” We booked the Hudson because the rates were great and we'd had a really nice dinner there years ago. Unfortunately that restaurant is no longer there. 
The hotel has a very hip entry and lobby. It's so hip, it doesn't even have a sign. Unfortunately the staff (dressed in black) isvery concerned with looking hip and thinks nothing at all about customer service. So after a long flight and waiting on a long, slow, line to check in we were told to get on line again when we went to our room and found the keys didn't work. The line was SSLLOOOOOWWW and when we finally got to the desk, the clerk ignored us completely, picked up the phone and made a call. The matress was so lumpy we could not sleep the first night. They did come and change it so that was OK the rest of our stay. The room is teeny, tiny. Crowded for a couple. The bathroom is tiny to the point of being nonfunctional. You have to puch against the bathroom door to look in the mirror. If the hotel has any amenities we were not aware of them. There is no guest literature in the room, no mini-bar, no coffee maker. The room looked out to a shaft so we never knew if it was day or night and the eco/green fluorescent lights just turned themselves off every now & then.
The carpet in the hall right outside our door was torn and once you leave the lobby, everything is run down. The lobby has LOUD music blasting at all times.
And then there was the cockroach! Now I'm originally from NY. I've seen lots of roaches. But I've stayed in many, many NY hotels and this was the first one I've seen roaches in.
All in all, the hotel didn't ruin our trip but I'd certainly never stay there again, even if they gave me the room for free.",damicom,2010-03-01,223023,2010-04-07,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Comfortable and fun!!” My colleague and I had meetings all over Manhattan, knowing every clients' 1st question is...""Where did you stay?"" we wanted to have a good answer. So we stayed one week at the Hudson hotel in a Double Deluxe room. The beds were soooo comfortable, everything was always clean when we came back from a long day of meetings. Shacazia at the concierge desk also was so helpful, by the end of the week I was hugging her goodbye, incredible service, she would do just about anything for us to make sure we were situated well.

"“Disappointing” I booked this hotel last mintue and was lured in by the fancy looking website and the term ""luxury hotel"". Had I don't my homework and read reviews and seen the hotel beforehand, I wouldn't have booked it. Its a bit of a con really, claiming to be trendy and stylish. Its dressed up chicken coop.
On the face of it the hotel doesn't look half bad. The lobby is clean and big. It took me a few minutes to find the hotel as there is nothing to indicate that this is a hotel. I actually went in once and came out thinking I had walked in to an apartment building by mistake. Once you get to the lobby. 
The lobby was very dim and dark. I found my self having to shuffle to a light to find my booking reference. After finally getting checked in, I headed up to my room on the 16th floor. It was a fair walk from the lift especiallt with all my bags and being as poorly lit as the lobby. I didn't once see a concierge to help.
I found my room/cupboard. It was, by no exageration,... TINY! I couldn't get my case in the room past the door way so I left it there under the coat rack. As I was travelling with a friend I expected two beds. We had to share a ""double"" which it was barely big enough for one person. The floors and walls were wood-panneled, and they had even tried to create the illusion of space by having a big mirror to give the impression the room was larger than it was. 
I know some people must be thinking ""I bet this guy is some rich toff who travels 1st class"" etc. I am a student who is used to roughing it. I have to say I have seen better student halls than this hotel. Every thing about the room was cheap. From the decore to the bed sheets. 
All in all, if you are traveling alone you might find it livable for a few days. If like me and are with some one, find somewhere else. Having to climb over the bed to pass eachother in the room gets tedious after the 5th time.",MattandJ,2010-04-01,223023,2010-04-26,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

But for the money you are better off picking another hotel. The only time I would recommend is if you hooked up at the bar and wanted to get a quick room for some fun.

“It was a great trip” The Hudson Hotel is in an excellent area and stylish. The staff was wonderful and helpful. The rooms are small but very comfortable and clean.

"“A superb hotel - one that exceeded all expectations!!” My husband and I stayed at this hotel with our three children - all under the age of 4 - and we had a fabulous stay. The lobby is very impressive - it has a massive glass ceiling that is covered in vines and opens onto a secluded outdoor terrace. You'd never know you were in a bustling metropolis. The bell staff were great - very friendly and knowledgeable about the city, and they helped keep our kids occupied as we checked in. The front desk staff were professional, friendly, and efficient - we were checked into our room very quickly. We were even upgraded to a room that had a little ""living room"" area, which was perfect for my kids to claim as their own. I had heard that the rooms in the Hudson Hotel were incredibly small, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the room fit our family of five, all our luggage and a baby crib in just fine. The bathroom was small but we still managed to bathe 3 children in it. Another bonus - as the hotel knew we were coming with a baby they provided a crib free of charge and also managed to find a small apartment style fridge for us to keep in our room so that we might keep milk for the baby cold. Whatever we needed, the staff at the Hudson Hotel were quick to accommodate us. The beds were so comfortable (queen size) and the pillows and linens were so soft it felt like I was in heaven. I could have slept for days in those beds! We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant - not only was the food on the buffet delicious but it had a good variety of things to choose from as well. The location was fantastic - only 2 blocks to Central Park (5 minute walk) and to loads of great shops!
All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We hope to return to this hotel and to experience more of New York (without kids this time) and highly recommend the Hudson Hotel to anyone visiting New York City.",aemcdonald,2010-03-01,223023,2010-04-22,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Typical trendy hotel - all flash and no substance” I found this hotel using Priceline. Had I had a chance to see the hotel beforehand, I would never have booked it. Why ? Because it is typical of a modern type of hotel, one that prides itself on being modern, hip and stylish.
Whoever owns this hotel is either an idiot, or believes his guests are. He must think that they are happy to pay for style, at the expense of a good night's sleep.
Everything about this hotel is amateurish, beginning at the entrance. Walking in off the street, there is nothing to indicate that this is a hotel; rather, it seems like the service entrance of an apartment building. There are escalators up to the lobby - except that they were out of order when I arrived (10pm April 19, 2010). An unmarked passageway led to elevators where, if you guessed correctly, you pressed ""L"" to take you to the lobby for check-in. (If you were a non-English speaker, or visually impaired, well I guess you would eventually find your way there).
I had a 20 minute wait to get checked in - and this was at 10PM ! That was a precursor of the standard of service to come. The lobby had muted lights and non-muted trendy music, giving the feel of a nightclub. After finally getting checked in, having received a brusque reference to ""the night being busy"", I made my way to the elevator. The 'house'-type music being blared in the elevator made me nostalgic for traditional elevator music, something I never would have imagined could be possible...
Emerging on the 6th floor, I felt like I was in a maze. I had to follow what seemed like an interminable path, around countless turns, with poor directions. While I have no doubt that the Hudson passes its fire inspections, I would dread being in this place were a fire to occur. Poorly lit hallways, with drab and dreary colors on the walls and floors brought to mind soviet-era hotels.
The room was what used to be referred to as a ""box room""; it was barely big enough for a futon type bed, and a TV. The floors and walls were wood-panneled, the windows thin, and one wall had a mirror to give the impression the room was larger than it was. 
In fact, impression is the theme here. Clearly aimed at impressionable younger tourists who mistake trendiness for comfort, most of the fixtures seemed to come from designers who believe that changing traditional designs is an end in itself. Instead of understanding that there is a reason why fixtures with traditional designs survive, due to their utilitarianism, these new designers produce 'modern' items that are impractical and often flimsy. So the light switches are annoying - and, of course, inconsistent : long and narrow, some of them are intended to be pulled, others to be moved up or down. And why the ridiculous design ? Just to be different.
Similarly in the bathroom, the wash basis is the 'modern' bowl with a faucet suspended above it. Traditional washbasins evolved the way they did to prevent water splashing out on the floor when the faucet is turned on; clearly the designer doesn't understand that, or that bowls with elevated faucets are a primitive design, and so whenever you use a sink at the Hudson you risk being soaked.
The shower is an afterthought, with spray being retained by a vinyl shower curtain. The air-conditioning is right beside the head of the bed, perfectly placed to cause chills, although it is necessary to use the fan to drown out traffic noise - unfortunately, the traffic noise in the room was so loud that my silicone ear plugs were insufficient for this purpose.
The beds, the most important items of furniture in a hotel, are appalling. They are as comfortable as a box spring; I defy anyone to sleep comfortably in them. The sheets are cheap and tacky, feeling like wax paper, and the bath towels are also cheap, and in short supply.
Incidentally, you of course have to pay if you wish to use the hotel's wireless service for internet access. As for proving it gratis as compensation for a delayed check-in, the thought never occurred to the hapless check-in clerk.
In a nutshell, if you are young and more impressed with style than substance, and likely to return to your room drunk so that you could sleep through an earthquake, then this hotel is for you. If not, find somewhere else.",nyc_hibernian,2010-04-01,223023,2010-04-21,False,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

“Terrible Hotel” We stayed here on business/pleasure and found it extremely noisy. It felt like you were sleeping on the street below. Unbelievable! The windows are paper thin. We moved to a high floor where it was supposed to be quieter - it was not. The room and bathroom are so small you can hardly move. We previous stayed at the Westin Times Square (same price).

"“Loved it once, am booking again!” After 3 months of solid internet searching to find accomadatiion in NY I kept going back to my first choice - The Hudson Hotel. Mr Starke's imput helped my decision of course. We were blown away the minute we arrived. Great public areas (we arrived very early and had a few hours to wait to check in so we sat in the room with the posters of cows in hats - so cool - and pool tables). When we finally got to our room it was everything I wished for, including the view from our window. Even the bad reviews about the room sizes didn't put me off. Why do you need huge hotel rooms? Obviously the reviewers who complain about that haven't been to Japan! You go to New York to experience the city not the inside of a hotel room. And if you need more space go to the reading room or the terrace. We are heading back to New York in September 2009 and I will not hesitate to book this hotel again. Can strongly recommend the Clift in San Francisco too. Now that's a beautiful hotel!

"“Small but perfectly formed” We stayed at the Hudson at the end of May 2007 and loved it - would definitely go back. Yes, the rooms are small, but this is New York and you're out and about all the time, so we literally just crashed out each night and got up refreshed to get out and do more. The beds are comfy, crisp white linen, bathroom is small but everything you need. We loved the extra touches like dvd/stereo with CDs (we bought the Hudson cd and still love it - funky chill out style). The location's great - we walked down to the little deli (or whole foods at columbus circle) to buy breakfast and ate it in the sun at central park (2 minute walk). 
The weather was roasting and we wanted to get some time on the skydeck (which is really fab) but there's just so much to see and do in NYC that we didn't get time. The Private Park (open air bar) is fab - well worth grabbing a cocktail and lounging in style to start your evening off well. We found the staff really friendly too. 
Overall the hotel is big on style and small on space but a truly fabulous New York experience.

"“Do not come here sober!” We booked this thru Hotwire.com - do not ever book thru them, they don't tell you where you're going until after you pay (non refundable) for the room.
Even though the price may seem right, and it is centrally located, this is one hotel you do not want to stay at, ever.
Despite what they might say, two people can not comfortably be in the room at the same time.
There is no sign outside of the hotel on the street to tell you what it is
The place is dimly (dingily) lit.
It takes 10 minutes to get onto an elevator
The elevators are always jammed full of people
The lock to our room looked like it had been jimmied open with a tire iron. It would not lock properly.
There was no TP in the room
Even with closed windows the street noise was really loud.
The fire alarm was set off by partying teens at 2 in the morning. The entire NYC fire dept then screeched to a halt right outside our window.
If you like to party a lot, and are planning to come back to the hotel pretty drunk, then maybe this is the place for you. Everybody in the elevators the next morning looked really hung over.

"“Not the best hotel ever but you don't go to NYC to stay in your room!” My boyfriend and I went to the Hudson Hotel after it was recommended by a friend. After looking at the website, we both thought it looked great and booked it. They were offering a 15% discount on all pre paid reservations and as I had the money to pay for it straight away (back in January) we went for that option. I thought they would take the money almost straight away at the current exchange rate but they didn't actually take it until we checked out meaning because of the crappy exchange rate, I actually ended up paying around £50 more for it!!
The hotel itself is fairly impressive on arrival. Really funky and nice design. We knew from previous reviews that the rooms were small, and they really were, but to be honest all you do in New York is sleep and get changed in your hotel room so it didn't really bother us that much. Previous reports also said that the bed was uncomfortable but again, we found it absolutely fine and after a day/night out in NYC, you could sleep on a bed of nails you are so tired! The room was cleaned daily and when we had an issue with our power ( it completely cut out just in our room!) Housekeeping were very quick to send maintenance up who fixed it straight away. The bar was good, we went there on the first night and it is great for people watching. The bar service wasn't great though, waited for ages only for another couple to literally arrive at the bar and be served straight away. I soon told the wannabe model barman that actually we were there first and had been waiting for ages! We didn't really need to ask the staffs assistance on anything but they all seemed approachable and friendly enough. 
The downsides to this hotel is that it is very very noisy. We were on the 4th floor overlooking the garden area with a bar which is open until around mid night. This wasn't too much of an issue as we generally didn't get to bed until then but when you have the barmen clearing up with the music blaring, that poses a bit of an issue. The windows are so thin you would swear that they are actually open all the time! Another noise issue was the air con. It is so noisy all the time even when you don't actually have it on! The bathroom is very small and when you're over 6 foot, which my boyfriend is, it can be hard to even sit on the toilet!! There is also not a lot of room to put suitcases etc but again it wasn't too much of an issue. The lighting around the whole hotel is also very poor. They are obviously trying to create a mood with the lighting but it was actually pretty ridiculous!
The hotel is in a great location though and only minutes from Columbus Circle. I wouldn't not recommend it and if you have already booked it I wouldn't freak out about the other reviews on here too much. New York is such an amazing city that you will not be in your room for very long at all as you won't want to miss a single second of what the city has to offer.
A few of things we did whilst there:-
Get a NYC Explorer pass, definitely a money saver. We chose the 3 trip pass and went on the Movie & TV Tour, Top of the Rock and Natural History Museum. All really good. The Top of the Rock was amazing as we had a brilliantly clear day!
Bloomingdales and Macy's are a must, but do not miss out on Century 21 which is right next to Ground Zero. BIG discounts on designer bits! Whilst at Ground Zero, make sure you go into St Pauls Chapel. Whilst down that way, take a walk down Broadway to the Staten Island Ferry. This is free and will give you an excellent view of the Statue of Liberty. Takes 30 minutes to get out to Staten Island then you hop on the next one coming back to the city.
We also went to see The Phantom of the Opera. You get discount tickets on the day at TKTS which is right in the middle of Times Square. Don't be put off by the queues, they move really quickly.
We also took a carriage ride around Central Park which costs around $34 dollars for the shorter trip and $67 for the longer. 
The food is amazing and we didn't have a bad meal out there. Be warned, the portions are HUGE so only order 1 portion of chips or any other side order!!
We ate in Asia De Cuba on Madison, this was amazing, Barolo in Little Italy, again the best pasta I've ever had! Planet Hollywood was good and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse was amazing!!!! If you can, also take a trip to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on Columbus Circle. They have a bar on the 35th floor which has the most stunning views over the city. Go for brekkie or brunch at Sarabeths which is opposite the park, between 5th and 6th Avenue. 
I would recommend you get a taxi from and to the airport. They are set fares so you wont be ripped off and your driver will act as a mini tour guide! The cost is $60 dollars which is $45 for the fare, $5 for the toll and $10 for a tip. It takes around 30 minutes to get to the Hudson from JFK.
We bought a 7 day Metrocard which was $27 dollars. This worked out to be really good value as you will hop on an off the subway all day. It can be a little confusing but we didn't get lost once! Also make sure you wear tried and tested shoes! Although you will use the subway a lot, you will also do a lot of walking!!!
The people are unbelievably friendly, even random people on street or subway will take the time to speak with you if you need info. I was really impressed by this. I also didn't feel unsafe at all whilst there. 
New York is the most amazing place and it completely exceeded all my expectations. We had a great time and will definitely go back again. Have fun!!!",KatRaf,2010-04-01,223023,2010-04-18,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Seen anything smaller???” The very dark entrance after taking the narrow escalators was the first uncomfortable feeling.
Entering the room was a big surprise. Harly larg enough to accomodate a bed , a shower and a toilet.The additional problem was that we had difficulties to find a place for our traveliing bags. Only two pieces. We were making a two week round trip. To both myself and my wife she got a major attack of clautrofaubia. I will save you the details but whilst I was trying to get a larger room ( tree upgrades wes still small) she left the hotel and it too me quite some time to convince her to come back in. And I can tell you , we are experienced global travellers, including travelling into remote en poor area's en staying several days in a tsmall train coupé. This hotel is even not a joke anymore.
Check your bills, particularly at breakfast. I had to complain twice for overcharging and I heard another person having the same problem. Talking to a waiter , he told me this was routine as they assume 90% of the people take a full breakfast. This is an easy way to make money , but stealing in my opignon.

"“Great stay in great location!” My 15 year old daughter and I stayed for three nights in late April. We had a wonderful stay. We were on the 19th floor and could not hear any noise what-so-ever from the night club or other rooms. Our room was very quiet and we slept well. The beds and especially the pillows were very comfortable. The climate control system worked well. We even had a view of the river!
The hotel staff were all very pleasant and helpful, especially Kimberly, the guest experience manager. 
Breakfast was great - the coffee was terrific ( and I am quite picky about my coffee). 
Also, the hotel has some great common areas. We did not have time to relax in the library or the attached garden area, but both looked like lovely places to relax, have a drink, play a game, etc. 
The location is fantastic. My daughter and I were often able to walk to our destinations (theater, Rockefeller Center, Central Park) and the subway is very close - less than a block away. There are a ton of great, inexpensive restaurants on 9th Ave.

The hallways: felt like we were lost in hell trying to find our room. The smell of pot was everywhere.

"“Tiny rooms, but very cool overall.” Tiny doesn't even begin to describe the room size--luckily I am petite and was staying alone, so I just found it funny. However, if you are more than 6ft tall or planning to share a room, I'd try for an upgrade beyond the standard room. My 6'3 husband would have had a panic attack from claustrophobia! 
That said, everything about the Hudson screams cool. When you're in NYC, you're not usually spending much time in the room, so a small room is not really a big deal. The bars are unbelievable, especially the 15th floor terrace. It was a little chilly for May, but they had blankets to keep you warm up there so you could still enjoy the amazing view and great cocktails!

I get anxiety in small spaces- and this was just beyond tiny. It did not help that I had to wake up in the morning at 6 with no sleep. I had to do this for four days.

"“Great location/Great doormen/Great Sky Terrace/Tiny, tiny, tiny” After many trips to NYC,and hearing legendary stories about the Hudson bar, this was my first time staying at there for a mix of business and pleasure over the Memorial Day holiday. 
First impressions were spectacular. The doormen were awesome-cute, muscular, and polite. Helped carry bags out of the taxi. The green escalators carted you away from the craziness of the urban scene into the dark tranquility of the Hudson. The lobby was well-appointed as was the Hudson ""cafeteria"". However, $30.00 per person for breakfast was too much. Tip--go to the restaurant on the corner and get 2 eggs and a sausage for $9.00 bucks. 
The concierage staff was the best. The guys were very helpful. Interestingly, none of the staff looked over the age of 30! This is a place for the young and the beautiful (or the bold and the beautiful) (and the foreign tourist from Europe and S. America). Seriously, if you're over 50 years of age, consider another location. Mom and Dad wouldn't fit in here. I saw one couple in their 50's on the Sky Terrace--they looked liked divorcees and looked they were trying to be cool with the young guns. (It wasn't working and they soon departed.).
On Monday, around 7 PM Eastern I was greeted by the song ""Me, So Horny"" pounding in the lobby for the annual Monday night blowout party. Acccording to the DJ: ""Monday is the new Friday"" at the Hudson?!! The young and the beautiful crowded around the velvet rope.
The hotel staff was very cool and very accomodating. Now--the rooms. I started out in a tiny , smoking room on the 6th floor (I had booked non-smoking), but got upgraded to the 11th floor larger non-smoking room at no extra charge. The lamp on the tiny desk was broken in the first room and the lamp cord had been spliced together with tape! Scary! The engineer said that ""more of these lamps were on order, but hadn't arrived yet.""? The second room was MUCH better until the AC quit on the last day. It took 3 phone calls until Engineering finally showed up. The engineer stated that ""the fuse blew out down the hall"" and corrected the problem. You don't hang out in the rooms here. The clausterphobia will get to you within an hour. Basically, Ian Schraeger needs to bust down some walls and join some of the rooms into one to give more breathing space--but I'm sure that would cut into profits?. Note: The rooms are smaller even than the boutique hotels in Paris.
The fitness center looked pretty nice. The Sky Terrace bar had a terrific view. The cocktails were good, but the bar tenders seemed a bit ""green"". I kept waiting for Kim Catrall and Sarah Jessica Parker to show up at any moment. 
Finally, the place is very, very dark. It's soothing, but really I couldn't see far in front of me in the hallways. More light would be helpful especially to those of us in their early 40's. 
The location is ""the ace"". 2 minutes from Time Warner and Central Park. 10 minutes to the Theatres on Broadway and 46th. Would I come back? Maybe, but then again I might want to try another place also.",francophileguy,2009-05-01,223023,2009-05-25,False,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

For me, the room was just the right size. The hotel is centrally located and in walking distance of many fantastic restaurants, shopping, and the bright lights of Broadway. Additionally, there was a drugstore right on the corner...just in case!

This Hotel is exactly that..Fantastic..blew me away and I was so impressed it was a highlight of my trip no doubt
Clean, compact rooms, minimalistic in approach but the overall Hotel was so impressive, room size was not a deterent-{perhaps not practical for a family}

"“Sleeping in a box” I've stayed at the Hudson for one night during a business trip. The location is good, the service was definitely ok - but the rooms are not reasonable in size. It's not just that the room itself is only very very slightly bigger than the bed (if you actually look at the images at the hotel site - you can see it). It's that in the bathroom you can not sit on the toilet without having you knees bump the wall. The shower is also very narrow.

"“Bring your own light bulbs” The designers of this hotel clearly valued appearance and trendiness over functionality. The elevators are so dim it is difficult to find the correct floor button. The lighting in the rooms is so poor that I had difficulty finding items in my bag. Even the bathroom lighting is relatively dim. The beds are very low (no box springs) so be prepared for a long descent when it's time to retire. The one chair in the room is metal, cold and pretty uncomfortable. The seating in the public spaces of the hotel ranges from comfy armchairs to incredibly small, uncomfortable yellow plastic chairs. Let's not mention the log in the bar with the metal seat backs inserted at random intervals. 
 NYC hotel rooms tend to be noisy but this one exceeded any expected noise levels. The heating/air conditioning was very noticeable as was the untraceable, constant whine that combined with the other ambient noise. I was awakened several times during the night by noises that seemed to come from the window frames or outside the hotel.
 On the plus side, the rooms are scrupulously clean. The outdoor garden is beautiful as is the Library. You can visit those areas of the hotel without having to endure staying there.

"“The bar scene is the most redeeming feature here” Morgan's Group hotels are known for their hip bar scene, and its clear from my stay there that the hotel is an afterthought. The rooms are spartan and feel quite cold, and of course they are tiny. Walls are thin and noise from the room next door can be an issue. The elevator and corridors are dimly lit, so much so that you can hardly make out the floor buttons. The ice machines on my floor and two others I checked were broken for the duration of my stay. Check-in was a disaster, with a disorganized throng of people vying for the attention of the aloof staff - much like being at the bar. Overall the hotel employees seemed disinterested in the guests.

"“Too trendy!” This is my third stay in this hotel and i have always liked it. Yes the rooms are small -they even tell you this on the website! but the location is fantastic and the hotel bars are gorgeous- if a tad expensive. My issues this time round are the sudden appearance (well from our stay last year) of all these semi clad waitresses- now I am by no means a prude but the focus of these hotel bars is now very much on getting the beautiful crowd in, and unfortunately at times to the detriment of the paying guest. We couldnt get a seat in the bar on evening as they had all been booked up for some party from outside. The sky terrace bar is meant to be for residents only but when we were there, it was full of non guests and the door was lodged open so anyone could come in. Also I object to having to pay for wifi!! What i look for in a hotel is a certain level of comfort - i am happy to overlook extra space in my room if i can rely on a comfy chair and a cold drink at the end of a long day of walking and sightseeing - but this i not the case anymore in the Hudson - and the price of the drinks is quite offputting in these recessionary times, and for this reason, we will not be booking again next year.

"“Worst Deal in New York” I used priceline, and we ended up with a room at the Hudson. While the location was great for what we wanted (very close to Central Park and Times Square), we were extremely disappointed in what we got for our money. This hotel was rated as 3 1/2 stars. I'm shocked they can get that rating for their rooms. I've been in small New York hotel rooms before, but the Hudson's priceline deal takes the cake. The hotel attempts to be modern and minimalist. It appears they spent all their money in the common areas. The main reception floor was nice enough, but our room really started to look like a room you could rent by the hour the longer we stayed it.
First off, the rooms are so small that the doorways are also very narrow. The room was so small that we could not walk around the foot of the bed standing straight up for fear that we would knock off the flat screen with a horribly snowy picture and bad reception. in an attempt to make the room appear modern and larger, there are mirrors on either side of the room (one by the headboard and the other behind the tv). The wall separating the bathroom and the bedroom was also made of glass, so you could see someone having a bowel movement as you sat on the bed. Go figure! The pillow cases had some weird stains on it and also had holes. The mattress was so thin we could feel the springs as we laid on it. The bathroom tiles were cracked in places and the area under the spout looked like you could push right through the wall because of the number of large cracks in the tile. 
I travel quite a bit, and I never write bad reviews on tripadvisor. This is by far one of the worst hotels we've stayed at in over 10 years. The fact that the front desk staff seemed to care less if they had a long line of guests standing in line or waiting for them to get off the phone also did not help. 
I doubt I will try to bid on a room on priceline again for this area of New York for fear that I will end up at the Hudson again.

"“Dreadful service... don't waste your dollars staying here...” This has been the worst hotel for service I think I have every stayed at - it was that stark. We kicked off a five day stay by waiting 40 minutes for cocktails on the roof... there is only so many times you can get away with being told that ""I am so sorry for the delay"" in 84 degrees before it becomes profoundly irritating. I found the staff 'dress code' on the roof offensive - more of an undress code with young girls who have no concept of service walking slowly, talking slowly and generally parading around with almost nothing on. Completely inappropriate. Similar issues in the Lobby Bar. With our room being cleaned. Oh - and don't get the munchies after midnight... because notwithstanding that you are in the city that never sleeps, the Hudson kitchen will be closed! I really couldn't believe that one - but true! Lighting in our room was lamentable and was absorbed by some unnecessary dark wood panelling which looks dated - bring your own light bulbs. There are some pluses - the location is great. We had a studio room which was to be honest nice enough, but dated.

"“Like staying in a closet” People complain about small hotel rooms in NYC, but the rooms at the Hudson were ridiculous! I could lie across the bed and touch both walls with my hands and feet, that's how small the room was. In addition, there is no sound insulation in the room, so you could hear all guests coming down the hallway, as well as street noise (despite being 14 floors up). The worst part was that the room and hotel in general just felt dirty and worn-down. 
These things would be acceptable if you were paying a reasonable price at a 2.5 star hotel. However, it's a different story when you book a 4 star luxury hotel and pay nearly $300 a night.
I would not recommend the Hudson, or any of the other ""luxury hotels"" from the Morgans Hotel Group for that matter. This hotel group seems to pride themselves on creating hotels with a trendy scene, but they completely miss on the most important points that peope actually look for when staying at hotels: cleanliness, value, comfort, good service, and a good night's rest!

"“Nothing special and quite annoying to be honest. If you can avoid it.” Location is ok if you like to stay in midtown, rooms are ok but small, anyway this is NYC so it's quite normal unless you go for the real upscale hotels.
The real problem with this property is the service. Reception/front desk is slow as a snail and checking in or even get a simple information is a real adventure and staff is not really friendly. Be ready to wait in line for a considerable amount of time It looks more like a club/restaurant reception than a hotel one. Staff is just above decent training and they're not really helpful. Checking out I had to discuss because I've been charged double internet connections 3 times each day and the hotel was pretending the above...quite incredible!
It's a decent hotel but plagued by staff problems. I mean, considering what you shed for this property you should receive a spotless service, unfortunately it's not like that. It seems that the boutique hotel trend is turning more into a money grab thing to be honest. 
Another problem, that IS kind of bothering, is that the whole property is open to the public, meaning hotel guests don't have a dedicated location ONLY for them.. The bar turns into a club at night and The Library bar gets really crowded thus preventing guests to get their own table or even find a seat. 
An other detail that has to be considered is security. Elevators has no key slot to access guests floors so basically ANYONE can get to the guest rooms. I actually find this kind of annoying (to be fair) as there's even access to the elevators from street level! The security staff is always keeping an eye on everything but that's not enough. While staying there we found some people on our floor messing with bags just outside of our room, we informed security and they promptly took care of it but it's not the way the go as you can guess.
I don't think I'd return to this hotel to be honest. There're too many outside people prowling the premises and very little space for regular guests.
Considering what it costs next time I may go directly to an upscale property, at least security and guests space is 100% guaranteed.",Eraldo,2010-04-01,223023,2010-04-27,False,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

Staff is extremely helpful, especially concierge is of a very high standard. I can not address the space issues raised about the rooms as, luckily, we stayed at the room designed for people with moving challenges which was indeed very spacious. Rooms and communal areas were also very clean and nicely decorated; with regards to decoration, the hotel tends to be partially pretentious and/or worn out but the overall picture is of a modern and nicely put together hotel. Breakfast was of a good quality and range but we did not get to try the restaurant. Location is also very good with central park, 5th avenue and metro station at the doorstep.

"“My new favorite hotel!” I've heard about Hudson hotel for quite some time and have seen Pictures of the gorgeous interior. This hotel does not disappoint! 
Lets get the negatives out of the way  The rooms are rather small, this is to be expected of NYC hotels.
The positive attributes of this hotel are quite a few. First is the location. Just around the corner from central park! After grabbing a coffee I would start my day with a nice stroll through the park. 
The hotel is just down the street from columbus circle subway station from which many lines intersect. 
I was most pleased with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. I found the guest experience manager, Kimberly, to be exceptional in every way! 
As a frequent traveler I find many hotels lacking in real and substantive guest service. Hudson, and Kimberly proved to be a welcomed exception. If only more hotels had managers and staff like those at Hudson.

"“There's Small and then there's ridiculous” Ok...really...who decided to call this place a hotel? I've been to NYC dozens of times and stayed in dozens of places, small and large. This place is absurd. Your reservation should include a disclaimer against those with claustrophobia.
The room is (and I'm not kidding) 210 square feet which includes the bathroom, narrow hallway and the closet. And this is the upgrade! The actual living space is about 10 X 10. - just enough room for the bed.
I booked the hotel on priceline for 140. Had to pay a $60 upgrade and I still feel like I'm in an inside cabin on a cruise ship.

"“Bijoux room” I was highly curious about this hotel as all the magazines raved about it and I wasn't disappointed. If you get pass the fact that it is the tiniest room that I stayed in NY, it is charming. I found the staff friendly, especially the guys on door duty outside the hotel. Certaintly not stuck up like some places.
Reception could have done with more people to cover the volume and set up a queue as quite a few people jumped ahead of the line, which makes you angry as their arrogance.
I dined in the restaurant, sitting on the side table opposite the kitchen, watching the chefs cook. The waiters were very attendive and helped me with choosing my meal. 
What I didn't like were the cleaning staff knocking on my door at 8am, they kept asking me what time I was leaving the room and I would like a lie-in during my holiday but I felt like I should hurry up and get out so that they could do their job.
In the evenings, the queues for the lifts were huge, they should set aside lifts that are specifically for guests and not for the bars in the hotel. Also they could have better lighting in that section of the hotel as it's extremely dark!
Otherwise I enjoyed my stay, its close to the subway, central park, the mall and if the price was right, I would definitely stay again.",Suzy52,2008-09-01,223023,2009-05-18,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
“so small” my husband and I staid at the Hudson last week and were disappointed with the rooms and service provided. The check in staff was unfriendly and the rooms are ridiculously small. once our baggage was placed in the entrance there was no getting to the bathroom or out of the door but it was the most spacious part of the room...the bathroom can definitely only be used by one person at a time and turning around is a bit of a challenge - be prepared to bump your knees when on the toilet (and I am only 1.65m tall). the only ups were that the terraces are lovely on a sunny day and the location is good.,muffel2112,2010-05-01,223023,2010-05-18,False,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The room was no larger than 120 square feet and had terrible lighting. The bathroom was smaller than a closet.

There were ""escort ladies"" on the premisses at all times and when we were leaving early Sunday morning they were also all on their way out.

"“Nose bleedingly expensive yet ambience of a hostel” I wanted to be near the Lincoln Centre and was there for 8 nights. I had booked a studio at average $430 dollars a night plus multiple taxes. The so called studio was extremely small and dark with no lighting in the seating area. The toilet sported some pubic hair. I was upgraded to a suite which was much better but rather tired in its decor.
The queues at reception were extremely long so making an enquiry was not a quick process.
The bar charged $18 ($20 with expected tip) for a glass of house chardonnay and so I never ventured to the restaurant.
It was clear the hotel caters for a young clientele and there was a very loud disco bar at night tho this was not a problem as my room was quiet but it puts out of use the rather nice library bar (where one could use one's laptop during the day tho it was impossible to read as, like with the whole hotel, the lighting was extremely low verging on darkness).
The saving points were: the location with a good local diner and the Time Warner Centre nearby and some of the staff particularly those who helped with luggage.

"“fun, unique and corteous” The hotel is really fun. It is definitely not meant for families, but rather for friends and couples. There are 3-4 bars in the hotel, all completely different from one another. The hotel entrance is fairly simple, and there are no markings from the street to let you know what the building is - you just assume you're in the right place based on the address. All you see when you walk through the doors are 2 escalators, one going up and one going down. Once you do get up to the lobby, it is totally different from what you'd expect. A huge open space with brick walls and arched pathways to the patio, greenery and wooden chairs of all different shapes. The patio bar is beautiful and very relaxing, while the restaurant is like something out of medieval times with thick benches and high-backed throne armchairs. 
The rooms are tiny, just big enough for a bed, but they look nice, clean and comfortable. 
The staff is wonderful. They are friendly and helpful, welcoming without being overbearing. Everyone we had to deal with, from the check-in desk to the bell boy, to the waiters and cleaning staff was very professional and nice.

"“Would stay again” We stayed at the Hudson for a weekend in September while catching up with some friends in NYC. My partner booked this hotel on Priceline, so we got a decent deal but found out the hotel later. I was worried when I read all of the reviews on TA. Perhaps it was because we arrived with low expectations, but I found the hotel was fine, worth the cost, and yes, would stay here again. 
The hotel has a pretentious air, which in not my cup of tea, but we only used the hotel as a place to sleep and not for the social scene.
The hallways are dim in an attempt at mood lighting, but not dangerous and you can still find your room with ease.
We didn't bother to eat or drink there as we went out with friends , so I cannot comment on that.
The rooms are small by American standards. We still had enough room to open our suitcases and room to hang clothes. The bathroom is also very small, but we expected all of this from reading previous reviews. The room was clean, modern and suited our needs.
The locations was near to a subway station and taxi rides from to the hotel from various locations in Manhattan were not very expensive.",frankietan,2009-09-01,223023,2010-05-17,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Phillipe Stark's Folly” The location is great, but that's where the value ends. Worse yet, the attitude the staff gives off makes one wonder why they think you are staying at the White House instead of the Motel 6 you are really staying at.

"“Not worth the money” This review is for the hotel only (not the bar). I stayed here with my boyfriend for one night on a recent visit to NYC. So we arrive at the address and are like where is the hotel? There is no sign for the hotel, just a small, easily missed sign for Hudson Bar. After we figured it out we went in. The staff was pleasant and helpful. We'd arrived early so we left our bags and were told that we'd get a call when our room was ready. After a few hours with no call we made our way to the hotel (around 4:30pm) and were able to get into our room.
The room: it was not good. Honestly the size didn't bother me all that much. It's New York City afterall and we weren't there to sit in a room all day. There were a few things that did really bother me though. First of all, the lock was messed up. The metal plate on the inside of the door was missing a screw so it kept sticking out, making it difficult to close or open the door. We complained but nothing became of it, no one stopped by to fix it. The bathroom: ugh, the tub was so dingy. I've seen nicer bathrooms with cleaner tubs at the Holiday Inn. The bed: I'm only 5'7 and my feet were hanging off the end. If I didn't want my feet hanging off I had to sleep with my head right up against the headboard. Oh and in the morning the cleaning lady barged in without knocking. 
Pros: hip & trendy decor, decent location, friendly staff
Cons: the room, the length of the beds, cleanliness of the bathrooms, NOT WORTH THE PRICE!

"“The Hudson can be hit or miss. Miss and miss big time, hit, and you're alright!” As you will see by the various reviews from Trip Advisor, a stay at the Hudson can be VERY hit or miss. I have stayed there perhaps ten times over the years, but hadn't been there for a few years, and found the hotel generally the same.
If you are a group leader, (and I was in this case as I was bringing a group of people to New York to do a commercial--I was the producer), you are almost certain to have some angry folks. As an example, in the case of the job that brought me out there...
I, had a great room with a triple upgrade that was very tasteful and roomy. My only problem was when the hotel internet went down for almost 12 hours. Oh, and the main light went out in the entrance to my room that they replaced....three days later. And on my last day, the key machine broke which meant that everytime I had to go back to my room, I had to wait 10 minutes for a security guard (I checked out early and moved to another hotel). Nonetheless, I had a good experience there.
My executive producer checked into a room...that had blood on the sheets. That didn't go over so well for him, or his wife.
My director moved out after one day as her room was dirty upon arrival and had some kind of air conditioner/boiler that kept her up all night. ""Enough,"" she said (and she says she has never checked out of a hotel before where the rest of her team was staying at).
Our other five guests didn't complain...only the most important ones to me! So if you are a group leader, you are BOUND to get complaints as there definitely are problems with the hotel...whether the size of the room, whether the service, etc. We had room upgrades for our room, or I would have expected more complaints as the botton tier rooms are so small that if you eat a Hostess Ho Ho, you'll fill the room and won't be able to move.
As for service, it can be very hit or miss.
One day we had a challenge with one of the folks at the front desk and any other hotel would have fired her for her rudeness (and we're actually very easy to please...but the hotel staff isn't trained in classic hotel management, or if they are, most of them have not read the manual as they're out at casting calls and auditions during the day).
But in a Four Seasons ""yes sir, yes maam"" ""my pleasure"" kind of way...don't expect that.
The reason to stay at the hotel...??. 
The entire lobby area, restaurant, outdoor patio area is fantastic. Very cool. Great bars and common areas.
I will say that in the bar area where they have the restaurant, there is a bar with only ten seats, and often they have three bartenders behind the small bar....who....are so entertained by themselves that it takes a good amount of work to get their attention...and they're only eight feet away from you. They're nice, but....not attentive. But it's still fun to sit there and mingle. And the food in the restaurant is good, especially the comfort food. And if you don't mind the $27 buffet breakfast price, the breakfast buffet is nice.
And if you do have a nice room, it will never be large and cavernous (wasn't it once a former YMCA?), but you might luck out. Don't count on it.
Also, it's in a great location, only one block from Columbus Circle and Central Park, so you can't ask for better than that. That's one of it's best attributes. Move this hotel to anywhere else in the city and ... it would have closed already.
And the price can be great....which is what led us back there.
Would I go back again? Yes, but...it would be depending on price, but I wouldn't bring a group back as it's not worth it if they're unhappy and complaining.
As you can see from Trip Advisor, the hotel essentially doesn't even bother responding to guests complaints. The hotel can be fantastic for some, and a disaster for others and that's simply the way it is at the Hudson. If you go in expecting a toss of the coin, you won't be surprised. Hopefully you'll get lucky!

"“I love to stay at the Hudson - but I wouldn't pay rack rate” I love to stay at the Hudson. I love not knowing where it is until you're right up on it. I love the huge flower pots. I love the peek-a-boo shower. It feels so New York to stay there, and adds to the ambience of every part of the trip.
That said, I only stay there if it I get a great deal. Every insult is also true. I don't think you could even sit on the toliet if you were overweight. And, my favorite, the last time I was there they charged me $19.95 for something... which wasn't there on check out. Okay, sure, except I really didn't take anything or eat anything, etc. But I didn't care enough to call and have them remove the charge, it's just something I still remember...

"“Terrible” This has to be the worst hotel in the world - and I've stayed at some bad ones. 
I am so angry I simply had to write my first Tripadvisor review to release the anger slowly eating away at me inside.
The service is dreadful. When I arrived I had to wait about 30 minutes to speak to someone at the front desk and check in as they were woefully understaffed. Not acceptable in a hotel of this price.
There is also currently no restaurant in the entire place serving food. Nothing. No mention of that on the website or when I made my reservation.
I saw poached eggs on the room service menu and fancied that for breakfast, but it wasn't available in the breakfast room. Only a greasy-looking buffet. in order to have anything off the menu you had to order it to your room. So I suggested I ordered it to my room then brought it down to the breakfast room myself. Ridiculous.
Many of the staff I encountered were more interested in looking cool than actually helping you. I have found a similar problem with hot-looking but cold-acting staff at their sister hotel The Mondrian in LA. 
In fact a similar criticism could be made of the hotel itself. It looks great and I like the art and design details in the communal areas. But those aesthetics don't matter if the experience is an ugly one.
I also had the misfortune of having to phone the hotel about something after I left. I was chucked around various departments and eventually cut off on numerous occasions. Rude.
There is no fridge in the room. In fact there is nothing in the room.

"“Not THAT bad after all” After reading the reviews, I was prepared for the worst. I booked via Priceline for $200 per night on a busy weekend in May, and Priceline reservations are nonrefundable. Here is my honest assessment:
The good: the lobby and other public areas are nicely decorated, the check-in person was very friendly, the conceirge/baggage assistance was very friendly, check-in and check-out were very quick; great location just off of Columbus Circle. Starbucks on the same street, Dunkin Donuts just around the corner. 
The bad: The bed was rather hard and had no sheets or blankets, just a bottom sheet and a very thick duvet cover. You had two choices - sleep with no blankets at all (too cold) or the heavy duvet cover (way too warm); long wait for the elevators (it was a busy weekend at this hotel); no tub - just a shower; strange spooky yellowish lights on either side of the bed - they had painted shades with with a three-eyed woman on them. May give you nightmares! :) 
Our room was small but nowhere near as small as what others have mentioned. You could get into the shower easily, without stepping over the toilet. There was plenty of room for your knees when using the bathroom. Looking at the room diagrams posted on the back of the door, it looks like we had one of the larger ""standard queens"". I could see that other rooms were smaller than ours. I guess we just got lucky? With Priceline you have no say in what room you get - I didn't even bother to ask for any kind of upgrade at check-in. 
All in all, this hotel met my expectations, which were definitely low, having read numerous other reviews. I would still use Priceline again in the future, given the significant savings over posted rates for hotels in the area.",browneyedgirl001,2010-05-01,223023,2010-05-23,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The rooms were beyond small! You could not fit more than one very small suitcase in the room. We had to open the blinds and window because I was getting so claustrophobic! The bathrooms were the real joke! You literally had to turn sideways to get on the toilet and when you finally made it on your knees smashed into the wall! Anyone over 6 ft could not use that bathroom! Also, the lighting was terrible!

Location was great. Only 1 block from subway, Near Central Park. 
Service was not great. Second day, they only left one washcloth. We got back to room about 10pm, called and asked for one. They said that they would send right up. 30 minutes later - we had to call again. When it finally arrived - almost an hour after the original call - they delivered a towel - not a washcloth. Third day was a repeat of the second... except this time they did not leave any washclothes.

"“Great location, Smiling staff, Clean small rooms” The escalator takes you up to the dark and trendy Lobby and lounge. There are no signs - the Check-In desk is facing you. The concierge desk is to the right. NOTE: Not the best place for children since the lobby converts to a lounge at night and or course, the escalator. 
The staff was wonderful - I was allowed an early Ck-in (11:00) Easter Sunday and had additional days booked. The young woman arranged for the same room for all 4 days. Wonderful since I needed to shower and change before Sunday dinner at 1:30.
 My room (1808) was small with no frills, but very clean. If you are accustomed to living in small spaces (boats/RVs) then it's great for a couple. I stored my bag under the bed. In fact the bathroom is so small that reminded me of the boat I once owned. (see photo)
Internet is extra and costs $10 per day. That was fine since I got the room on Priceline for >$100.

"“Can be a good value for the right price” I had a very decent experience at the Hudson. We had booked it at a steep discount based on a “secret sale” from Quikbook (similar to Priceline), and when I found out the hotel name and checked the reviews, I was a bit nervous. But really, for the price we paid, I thought it was a good deal.
First, as others have said, be prepared for a *really* small room. Realistically it’s meant for one short and very skinny person, but two people can stay here, as long as you don’t have too much stuff and can tolerate extreme closeness and very little privacy. The room consisted of a queen bed, with maybe 2 feet of space on either side, small flat screen TV on the wall, and mirror on the other wall to prevent total claustrophobia. There is a tiny desk and a couple of drawers for clothes, plus an open closet and a few hooks on the wall. The bathroom is minuscule as well (I’m 5’2” and could just barely sit on the toilet with my knees in front of me). I had to change clothes in the little entryway. Whoever compared it to a cruise ship cabin is accurate. 
After my initial laughter at how small the room was, I began to reluctantly admire its efficient use of space. It wasn’t brightly lit, especially with the dark wood paneling and flooring, and there is no natural light, but the lamps provided enough light to read a bit at night. The bed was low to the ground, but comfortable. Also, unlike others’ experiences, our room, including the bathroom, was very clean and in good repair.
That said, like a cruise ship cabin, a hotel room in NYC is just a place to stash your stuff and sleep when you’re not out and about. So for that, it worked out fabulously. The location is fantastic - less than a block from the Columbus Circle subway station (and a short walk from several other stations) and easy walking distance to tons of restaurants and shops on the West Side. The Time Warner Center across the street has a huge Whole Foods in the basement, which is a great place to pick up breakfast or a quick lunch. I didn’t find the location or the street seedy at all, even walking back by myself at night. 
We had very little interaction with the staff, who seemed typical of the snobby and inefficient staff present at most “trying to be boutique-y” hotels. The drink prices at the hotel bars are outrageous, but I shouldn’t have been surprised by that, it’s New York and with so many other options no need to spend money there. The lobby had an unpleasant, mildewy smell so we didn’t linger there either.
Would I pay full price for a room here? Never! But would I stay here again for the right price? Yes.",Essie16,2010-04-01,223023,2010-05-20,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Rooms are inferior quality and poor value for $$” As former NYC dwellers and current, regular visitors, we really appreciate the small size of the typical NYC hotel room; however, the Hudson Hotel rooms are well below the bar on this scale. From a trendy design perspective, the lower levels of the Hudson Hotel (i.e., bars, lounges, etc.) are well designed and executed. I have always liked people watching in the Hudson Hotel Bar and I love grabbing a drink at the library bar. I'm sad to say that the hotel rooms don't live up to the standards of the rest of the hotel. We stayed in a Deluxe King room, which was uber small and poorly conceptualized from a functional design perspective. The combination of these design flaws made the room feel cheap and gimmicky in my opinion.
Pros:
- Hudson Hotel Bar & Library Bar
- Location, location, location 
Cons:
- Ridiculously small rooms (i.e., the upgraded room fits a King Size bed with just enough space to walk around the bed on either side 1.5 ft, I'm guessing). There also is a small writing desk placed immediately at the foot of the bed, and a privacy curtain because the hotel door literally opens directly to the hotel bed.
- Thin walls - because the rooms are small and there are thin walls you can hear people in the hallway walking and casually talking as if they were in your room. Not to mention what happens after hours with the inebriated guests return to their rooms between 2-5 am blissfully unaware they are waking other guests on the floor (and lets hope they don't after party in the room next to you...). Of course, this unlucky situation has occurred on two of my three of my trips to this hotel.
- Tiny bathroom (i.e., an estimated 4' x 4' partition of the room). From a design concept, the open glass wall in the shower stall looking into the bedroom could have been really sexy, but the shower is so small that the curtains from either side of the shower (i.e., shower entrance and 'viewing window' curtain if open or closed) literally stick to your legs on either side while you're trying to shower, so you feel like you're trapped in wet blankets during your shower. Secondly, the shower curtains are so light and flimsy that loads of water escape on the bathroom floor during your shower, and extra towels are not provided (two per room). Third, you literally have to hurdle over the toilet in order to get to the shower. Fourth, there is no space for your legs between the toilet and the wall. I probably sound like a massive person to you by now, but keep in mind that as a 5'7'', size 4 female, I don't think at my size that I should have to sit on a toilet sideways to fit!
- Bag service is a bit slow, but that is minor.
Things to consider:
- If you want a nice hotel in a good location, there are much better and more comfortable rooms in Midtown (even the Doubletree, Hilton, and Courtyard Marriott in midtown have nicer, larger rooms) or, if you want to keep the caliber of a nice, trendy hotel, there are other locations downtown that keep with the trendy vibe (i.e., Gramercy Park Hotel, SoHo Grand). 
- All trendiness considered, I actually prefer comfortable and functional rooms. So, from a quality of sleep perspective, the rooms at the above mentioned hotels are superior values for money, despite their mundane brand names.
- This hotel may be good for you if you stay in NYC one night and plan to do nothing more than pass out in the bed and check out in the morning. With the lights out, the Hudson Hotel feels more like a trendy college dormitory hall than a trendy NYC hotel.",pinkissima,2010-01-01,223023,2010-05-20,False,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Much better than expected” I am a little confounded by the number of poor reviews. Priceline picked this hotel for us, and after booking I read the hotel reviews which made me very nervous about having to stay here. As you may know, Priceline does not allow cancellations. So we expected the worst and hoped for the best.
The location is good, close to Central Park and we felt it was a safe area with easy access to public transportation. It is noisy due to traffic (people like to honk horns at all hours in NY City). I am a light sleeper, and earplugs helped reduce the noise. We were on the fourth floor and could not hear any music at all in our room from the hotel's nightclubs, although one night someone on our floor had a very loud party until about 2:30 a.m., but we did not complain since we were still up anyways. 
We were not allowed to reserve a non-smoking room in advance. We were told to ask when we checked in. Luckily when we checked in they had one left. But if they had not, we would have been quite upset since one of us is allergic to tobacco smoke. I would recommend to the hotel that they allow the option to reserve a non-smoking room in advance. 
My fears subsided some when we arrived and took in the outside surroundings and the really cool entrance and lobby inside. But I was still scared about the room. I was so relieved after we entered the room and inspected the bed sheets and bathroom and saw it was all just fine and clean. Our room had one queen size bed. The bed was average in terms of comfort. There was adequate room to stretch out and put all our luggage. The bathroom is tiny and does not allow for significant privacy from the rest of the room. I am a smaller person and imagined a much larger person would have difficulty using the toilet and sink. The building seems older but I thought the room was in good shape and decorated to match the urban chic theme of the hotel.
Every single employee we ecountered gave excellent customer service. From the front desk to the maid service to the guys carrying our bags and hailing cabs for us. Top notch on every level.
If you have a strong preference for more traditional/family style hotels, require larger bathrooms, or wish to have a more tranquil setting, then I would suggest stay somewhere else. If you are looking for a cool, unique hotel in a happening location, want a safe clean place at a decent value, then consider this hotel.

"“Why I Will Return to the Hudson!” In my rush to leave, I put the envelope with my trip receipts for reimbursement on the bed.

In my panic I made a desperate telephone call to Housekeeping at the Hudson. It is now 5:00 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon. A marvelous man said he would begin the search for the envelope. Voila! A few minutes he called back. The lost was found. The reimbursement check secured! He said he would put the envelpe and its contents in the mail on his way home (he did). Along with his great attention to detail, I applaud the room detail staff for their knowledge that something like my seemingly discarded envelpe might have value given that I had written ""Receipts"" on the outside of it.

"“Down Hill, badly....” Simply put, don't stay here. I stayed (staying as I write this) here with over 25 of my colleagues and feel horrible that I was the one that recommended it. Room specifics: 
1) the bathroom was filthy (toilet was actually cracked! How do you do that?)
2) the smoke smell was so strong that we had leave the pillows on the floor (both of us woke up with migraines from the smoke)
3) the white couch was covered in a nasty black substance.
4) the window sill was actually a broken board (see picture)
5) the room had a great view of what appears to be the central air conditioning unit for the hotel, which had the added benefit of sounding like jet was landing in our room.
6) the hotel restaurant (the only one) is actually closed and was supposed to be open over a week ago and still has not opened. There is no where to eat in the hotel other than room service.
7) the wifi network (which is free) only works when you step out in the hall so i had to step out in the hall to post this review...
8) Finally, the staff are unmotivated and unhelpful. We called last night to get hangers for our room (we had 3 in the room) and after four calls and two hours, we gave up. 
9) The outside patio is still a nice scene and decent place to get a drink (trying to be fair in my review)

"“Good Location, But TINY Functional Rooms” Hudson is in a good location - convenient to restaurants, shopping, Central Park and the Subway. 
However, I am a frequent traveler and the room was smaller than any other room I've stayed in before. The queen bed was fairly comfortable, but took up about 90% of the space. There is a small desk, but not even room for a chair. The blinds were problematic, as they let in a good deal of night. 
The bathroom is also just OK. Very small shower with decent water pressure.

"“What a location!” I have read some really bizzare reviews about the Hudson! 
Who on EARTH goes to NYC to sit in a Hotel room?, if thats you - don't waste your money stay at home. The rooms are fine, I'm over 6ft and had no problems what so ever with the size of them, including the toilet! I really cant understand how people are struggling to sit on it!!
The hotel is under a 5 minute walk to Central Park and its about a 30-40 minute walk to Times Square. At first we caught taxis everywhere, but after a couple of days and you get your bearings its well worth walking around the city. The underground is a 2 minute walk from the Hotel and only costs about $4 to get right down to the bottom of Manhattan, great value for money as a taxi would be about $40!
I have never been to NYC before but can't wait to go back and would stay in the Hudson again, for the price you pay its great value for money. 
The only downside I would say is the price you pay at the bar for drinks, its not cheap!
**TOP TIP**
Don't be scared to do/try anything, don't be fazed by the underground, don't spend all day in bed, we were up and showered for about 7.30 each day and went to the cafe across the road for breakfast-really good!

"“Friendly staff and perfect room for the occasion” The service at the hotel was unbelievable. When I explained the special occasion my fiance I were celebrating the upgraded our bedsize and also gave us a high room with river views. It was absolutely wonderful. While I agree with many reviewers that the rooom is quite small, I found it to be a very cozy small. I did not find it anxiety provoking and it was nicely set up. The lighting in the halls was perfect. The only weird thing was the window between the room and the bathroom, although a curtain could be closed.

"“Stylish inside, not much to look at from the outside” We stayed here for our honeymoon and this was our very first trip to the USA. The hotel was not much to look at from the outside but once you get inside it's a different story altogether. The lobby was very dark as well as the restaurant and corridors off the lobby. Very grand looking lobby and the library was amazing. The reception staff all tended to be fairly young, and as such could come across as being a bit rude as you were interrupting their conversations and they had to deal with you. The terrace was closed, we went up to the highest floor and was told that the terrace up there was only accessed by private parties. The bar was closed off for a private function for a couple of evenings so you had to go elsewhere for a drink. However, the bar was very funky, loved the floor!! The rooms were pretty bijou, with a small path around the sides of the bed. We found it a bit strange that you had a window from the room into the bathroom, so you could watch each other in there unless you pulled the shower curtain inside and the curtain in the bedroom. This may be an american thing?!? The bathroom was really small and you had to shut the door to get anywhere near the sink. However, the bed was comfy and the room was clean. No noise from other rooms. Drinks and food very expensive but food was really tasty. Not sure the whole experience was worth the money we paid especially as you don't get any breakfast (I know this is a common trait of american hotels) Good location for the trains, central park and times square.",SatMaz,2009-10-01,223023,2010-05-26,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

Of the 7 or so elevators, only 2 were working and guests had to wait in line up to 15 minutes to get to their rooms. The noise level from outside radiates in the room (9th floor), preventing the guest from experiencing a restful stay.

the air conditioner sucks and the plug under the desk doesnt work
I hate to say it but this time...

"“The Hudson was great - we really enjoyed our stay” Before booking this hotel I was put off by various reviews; some saying about the tiny rooms, noise factor, it being dirty, however I know that some people are harder to please than others so I took a chance!
I stayed for 4 nights with my Mum and we loved the hotel; the location was perfect for Central Park, 5th Avenue and Columbus Circle tube was nearby. We thought the hotel was gorgeous to look at with beautiful furniture, and 'outdoors inside' feel and a great, lively bar for drinks/dancing. They also have a roof terrace and a huge outdoors space with seating, beds to lounge on and helpful staff. 
The room was small but we found it perfect for us; I don't think anyone goes to NY to chill in their room do they? It was all very clean too.

"“If you want somewhere purely as a base this place is great!” After reading the reviews about The Hudson prior to our trip we were slightly concerned what it was going to be like! 
From the minute we walked in the door we knew that those reviews were probably from people that expected far too much this hotel. The staff were very friendly and accommodating (we asked for a high floor so we could enjoy the views!). 
Yes the rooms are small, yes the bathroom is on the small side but how big do you need the room to be? Are you in NYC to see the inside of your hotel room? I'd agree with people that said that The Hudson could do with a lick of paint but overall we had a great experience. 
The Subway is literally around the corner - and don't be afraid, people are so helpful!
It was NOT noisy as people suggest, they may have just had an unlucky stay, but we were there 4 nights and we couldn't hear a thing apart from a couple of sirens, what do people expect staying in the middle of Manhattan!? Go stay in NJ if you have a problem with it!
The only thing that I would say is that it would have been nice to have breakfast included but there are plenty of places close by! It would have also been nice to have A/C in the room as it was 90 degrees this weekend! It would have also been nice to have WIFI included, I thought $10 for a day on top of your bill was a bit steep.

Also, shower stall (no tub) had a glass wall facing the bed which might not be appropriate for all travelers - lovers yes, friends and/or family no!

"“Nice staff, slick lobby, HORRIBLE HOTEL” The lobby is cool. The restaurant and bar are fun. The staff was pretty nice. Everything else: HORRIBLE. The halls are creepy and dark and made me feel sort of unsafe. And when we reached the room itself, it only got worse.
If by some misfortune you are ever put in room 549 of the Hudson hotel RUN DON'T WALK find other accommodations. It faced a hideous and NOISY view of the air shaft and generator. Hot air blew out of the vents even when we put on the air conditioning, shooting the temperature up to an intolerable 85 degrees. Plus, I'm a vehement nonsmoker who was put on a smoking floor. As soon as I realized this, I went back down to the lobby to politely ask for a change in rooms and was told that nothing else was available. So I woke up at 2am gasping on my neighbors second-hand smoke and was unable to fall back to sleep for the rest of the night. Upon checkout, I made my displeasure known and the manager--who, like the rest of the staff, seemed nice enough by NYC standards--comped a free night in one of the Hudson's Deluxe rooms.

"“A hip hotel but felt like a cheap motel.” The Hudson New York is only worth for it's location and bar. The rooms are a shame for an upscale hotel. There are so tiny that the door almost can not be open completely, the beds are uncomfortable and the lack of room make you feel like a hospital room. Also we found it very unclean (see pictures).
Pros:
Great location
Public areas (bar, lounge, terrace, restaurant)
Courteous and helpful staff.
Cons:
poor quality rooms
horrible alleys (dark and smelly)
very crowded public areas, the bar on the weekends is crazy,
lack of room amenities like minibar, tiny desk, no luggage storage, awful bath room.
The AC is located just behind the headboard so be prepared to be cold all night and bring earplugs for the noise.
very very unclean and poorly maintained.

"“Tiniest Bathroom Ever!” The hotel is very hip and trendy. You'll feel more like you're at a nightclub than a hotel. The room was nicel decorated and clean. The size was decent for a NYC hotel. However, the bathroom is a whole other story. It is actually the sole reason that I cannot recommend the hotel. It is absolutely tiny. I am a rather petite woman, but I could not use the restroom without my legs hitting the wall. I have had tall friends who have stayed here and they had a horrible time for this very same reason.

"“Excellent hotel!” I stayed at the Hudson in March 2009 for one week and it was great. I cannot agree with all the negative reviews here, I had a great time at the Hudson. I was not sure if I should stay at this hotel prior to making my reservation, but it was totally worth it. My room (Superior) was not as small as I expected from the reviews, there was plenty of room for my stuff (same goes for the bath). The interior of both foom and bath was very nice and stylish. Same goes for the design and architecture of the lobby, the bar, the library etc. Everythig looked just perfectly stylish.
Another point that seems to get negative feedback is the music. Again, I do not agree. First, music can only be heard in the lobby and the elevators. Second, the music is not loud at all (don't believe the reviews talking about ""disco noise""). Third, I did not hear any music from the lobby in the hallways or in my room. In contrast, my room was super quiet. 
Another thing I really liked about the Hudson is the location. It's only a couple of meters away from Central Park and I went there for a run a couple of times in the morning. In addition, I found the Hudson to be an excellent starting point to discover the city by foot. 
The staff at the lobby was also very friendly and helpful, e.g. had very good advice concering running goods.
The only thing that gets a negative feedback from me are the prices for everything extra like drinks, breakfast, lunch etc. But then again, there are so many cool and nice locations in the immediate neighbourhood (check out the bars/restaurants/cafes on 9th Avenue), so this didn't really affect me.

I have traveled to NY for a number of years for business, stayed in many different top hotels throughout the city and I would honestly say that the Hudson is now my new favourite.

"“Uncomfortable bed, joke of a bathroom- not worth the price” The Hudson is in a great location and the the rooftop patio is wonderful, romantic and a great place to hang out and read or have a cool drink . that's where it ends 
.........IF YOU WANT A GOOD HOTEL ROOM FOR YOUR MONEY DO NOT STAY HERE 
it is not worth the price they charge. The bed was the worst I have ever slept in in any hotel. And to top it off the bed is positioned with the AC unit blowing full force on your head so you freeze and if you turn it off there is no air so you suffocate from the stuffiness. We have stayed in 5 other hotels in New York and the rooms in this one are the worst. The bathroom is tiny and feels like you are in a small restaurant bathroom.
There is no fridge in the room and the closet is super tiny and we didn't even stay in the lowest tier room we upgraded to the 3rd best type of room they had.
When I take a trip and pay a small fortune for a room I like to have a lush comfy bed and nice bathroom with soft towels and place where I can relax post walking around all day - pre going out to party at night - and I've stayed in hotels in New York for the same price as the Hudson that have this - it does exist - just not at the Hudson.

The ambiance, the hotel bar, the staff and the cool aura are all things that make this hotel unique in its experience. I now stay at the Hudson everytime I stay in NYC.
Speaking of staff, during my experience at the Hudson Hotel, I ran into a small problem with my room. Having checked in near midnight I was worried that it would not be fixed that evening. I headed down to the front desk and was greeted by a cheerful employee named Jerry Mackrella. My room was fixed in a very short time and I was more than happy with the service and attention received.

"“It is a shame, handy location but extremely small rooms, would not go back” I am not a picky traveler by any means, but I feel so strongly about this, I am compelled to write a review and I never write reviews. If you are thinking of staying at this hotel, don't. When people say these rooms are small, they are NOT exaggerating. We booked this hotel for 100 a night plus taxes through Priceline, it came to about 133 a night. We felt it was a good deal at the time, considering the location was so great, near Central Park and Times Square. However, by the time you add 55 dollar a night parking fee, 10 dollars for Internet and then the room size, this is no deal at all. The room can not accommodate more than 1 person walking around at a time. The bathroom is so small you have to sit sideways, or your knees hit the wall. The shower is of course also tiny, you can't move around without rubbing against a shower curtain or wall. Rooms were not filthy, but could have been cleaner. The closet was so small, you can not put any luggage in it, so you have to put your luggage around the bed and then you cant walk around the bed. If someone sits at the desk, you can not get to your luggage, etc. The bed was low to the ground, hard and not comfortable. There is no coffee pot or refrigerator in the room, but there is an iron, hair dryer and a little ironing board, good luck finding a spot to iron. No bathroom counter space, or good area to do hair/makeup. The rooms were not sound proof, kind of noisy, could hear neighbors, people walking up and down the hall and street noise. The lobby was really beautiful, very unique, but once you get on the floors, they are painted a dark gray with yellow lighting and is very dark, not a great idea for safety's sake. When checking in/out there was always a huge wait. The staff was pleasant enough, once you got one of them. When I brought up the issue of the small rooms to the staff, they responded by telling me the hotel rooms are suppose to have a ""cruise ship"" feel, please. Sadly, that is the best thing I can say. Next time I would stay out of the city and/or pay more for a better room, somewhere else. Also, I would not use Priceline again either, I would not say that was a 3 and 1/2 star hotel, not even close.",Imagine2010,2009-04-01,223023,2009-04-13,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

HATED IT! It definitely ONLY provides the bare basics. I believe I was in room 964. There was about 5-7 inches (barely) of walking space between the bed and the surrounding wall. The view out the window was great but although I kept it closed, there was a distinct draft that kept me shivering at night and since its so close to the main streets, there was A LOT of street noise that was very disturbing. The mattress was hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom was cute but again - cramped! You literally have to sit on the toilet in an angle of to the side since there is not enough space between the wall and the toilet to sit straight. 
Decent for the location of the hotel but I like a good night's sleep and therefore, won't be staying here again and is why I am giving this hotel an average rating. 
The staff were excellent. I really want to recognize this aspect of the hotel because although I wasn't satisfied the room, the service was enough to keep me content without complaints.",Scorpio14,2009-04-01,223023,2009-04-13,False,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Im pleased we booked this hotel! Room was perfect! Hotel services/bar pricey tho!!” We arrived on saturday afternoon and was welcomed by pleasant staff. Our room was on the 5th floor. I was nervous at arrivin in our room after readin the reviews on here!!! So i was pleasantly surprised when we opened the door to find a decent sized room. It was beautiful. We were on a corner so had two huge windows. Both over lookin the court yard!
The room was lit dimly but the bathroom lighting was bright enough to do my make up in perfectly! It was nice to have a room with atmosphere. There was a huge mirror in the room and one in the bathroom. 
There was plenty of hangin space and room to put our 4 suitcases!!! There was also a draw and a dressin table. The bathroom also have 3 shelves. There were some hangers in but i took some of my own anyhow.
There was a TV with many channels and the opportunity to watch movies.
There was a CD player and a hairdryer - which was amazin! I never used the one i took with me! So leave urs at home and save on weight! There was a lso an iron and alarm clock.
The room was clean, the only dirty part was black marks in the toilet. The room was cleaned daily and fresh towels. 
The air com was noisy but did not prevent us sleeping. On the Tuesday night we went to bed at 12pm and there was a party inthe courtyard which was very noisy but we were so tired that we fell asleep anyhow. The rest of the time there was no real noise disturbance.
I loved the character of the room and was sad to have to leave it behind. 
The sky terrace was beautiful and the views were amazin! 
The rest of the hotel was dimly lit and was fine, but i reakon a little brighter lightin would be useful. It felt a little seedy at times! 
The drinks in the hotel are a total rip off!!!! BE CAREFUL! For one small glass of wine and a bottle of beer it was $24. The wine was £10!!!!!!!
Check out was 12pm and we didnt fly until the evenin. So we checked our bags into the hotel lobby. They took the cases and put them in storage and when we were ready to leave we gave them our tickets outside the hotel and they brought them out and put them into the taxi for us! Really good service!
We really only used the hotel as a base to sleep and get changed, But i wud have happily had an evenin chilled in the room watchin tv as it was very cosy!
The hotel is a great location. Close to Columbus St Subway which has great links to most of the island. Its a 2min walk to Central park. Shops, pharmacy and food places close by. 20 min walk to Times Square. 5 min walk to 5th Avenue.
The only issue i have with the hotel is the cost of drinks and extra services. You were charged $10 per day for Wi-Fi!",babysmiler,2010-06-01,223023,2010-06-14,False,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“The original bedroom from hell” Just returned from a trip to New York
Stayed at the Hudson Hotel for 4 nights
It has all been said in previous reviews about the rooms
The standard double room sucks
The lighting does not hide the dirt ( stories about hip athmosphere hence the subjued lighting are just that stories and excuses for very weak room standard
I understand that to create athmosphere in the bars and restaurants subjued lighting can be effective , but in my opinion it is definitly not suitable for bathrooms or corridors
leading to the rooms.
The lighting in the bars and sitting areas in the lobby would be definitly an advantage for anyone having an illicit affair ( perhaps thats part of the reason for it )
The staff were wonderful and deserve to be working in a much better hotel.
I wont go into all the normal amenities missing from the first room we were allocated such as facilities for a cup of coffee or a safe for our passports but suffice to say when a safe was put into our upgraded room it was just placed on a shelf so that any body could just put it under their arm and walk away with it
What kind of managerial mentality can do such a thing ? 
Wonderful location. use the room just for sleeping or pitch a tent in the lobby
On second thoughts the tent in the lobby would be the better option.
So to the staff at the hotel i say thank you very much for doing your best to rectify the problems ( see below list )with the first room we were given
Extremly noisy air con unit ( making sleep impossible the first night after an 11 hour flight )
No safe in the room for passports etc/
No tea/coffee facility 
no hairdryer
Black stains on the toilet
Television placed so it was impossible to watch it
Bathroom so small it was almost impossible to use.
Lighting so low made it impossible to read or shave.
Ice machine on our floor not working.
I will certainly not return to this hotel and certainly not reccomend it to anyone
who has any idea of what constitutes a normal room.

"“""Sorry, no laptops."" What?” The Hudson is, like the Paramount, a tiny-roomed hotel with visions of chic. I don't mind the size of the room. The bedding is always nice. The bathroom is an exercise in spatial patience. The halls and doors are jarringly loud. Fine. I can deal. But when I and my colleague went to the ""Private Park"" for drinks and to run though our presentation, we were told ""Sorry, no laptops allows."" Forget the absurdity of attitude. We were surrounded by smartphone and iPad users happily socializing. Fine. I can deal. We went to the Hudson Bar, which had a total of 4 people in it and plenty of open tables and chairs, settled in, ordered a drink, took out my laptop. ""Sorry, no laptops."" Um, where do you suggest we conduct our brief business? ""In the hall, would be fine."" The dark, dim-but-chic hall surrounding the lobby? ""Yes, they are dark...but yeah, that would be fine."" I spoke with the concierge, who apologized, said a manager would contact me. It's been two weeks. Fine.

After a 7hr flight i wanted a nice shower but the shower head wouldnt work, i went down to the front desk and they said they would send maintenence up. The next day and nothing. I go back down and they apologise and upgrade us to a bigger room! Although we only have the view of the inside of the hotel (i.e other windows!) the room was a great size. We ordered room service and although slightly steep in price it was a one of stay and the food and service from the porter was fantastic! It was ashame my partner was only 19 at the time so we couldnt get a drink in the brilliant bar/club but thats US laws!

One side of the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a sheer curtain. The entire bathroom is approximately 3X7ft including the shower area!. Outlets are scarce, so charging a cel phone and a laptop simultaneously is a challenge. On a positive note, the concierges were quite friendly and helpful.

My biggest complaint was how noisy - you could not only hear the street but banging and clanking - maybe the heating system all night. I had earplugs but even so, it was very annoying.
However, I paid only $100 on Priceline which is fantastic for a good hotel in a good location.

"“Great Location and Terrace, but Rooms Ridiculously Tiny” My husband and I recently stayed at the Hudson on a business/leisure trip to New York City. The location is fabulous--close to all New York has to offer, including Central Park and great restaurants. We easily walked/took subway everywhere we needed to go.
The other reviews pretty much sum it up but I will give it my take--the common areas of the hotel are stunning and gorgeous. We enjoyed drinks out on the terrace (very overpriced ones, but hey, its New York) and the lobby is quite lovely. The common areas were always crowded with a good vibe. The service at the hotel was good and employees friendly. For the above reasons, I would recommend the hotel.
But...oh my...the rooms are an absolute disappointment. You get to the room and it is basically a closet. Our room wasn't especially clean--mold in the shower and dusty. We have traveled all over the world and stayed in some very small rooms, but this room wins the ridculously tiny award. A person over 6 feet tall would not be able to use the toilet (I am 5'8"" and my husband 5""11, average builds, and knees were hitting the wall) and would probably feel claustrophobic when in the room and bathroom. 
New York can be a very intense place, and when I go there I certainly do not hang out in the room, but it is nice to come back to one that is comfortable. The Hudson should really reconsider its configuration--given the good parts of the hotel, they could make the rooms bigger, charge a lot more, and it would be a great value. I hesitantly recommend the hotel...just don't be surprised when you open the door to your room and make sure you don't have problems with claustrophobia!",Apriljl,2010-06-01,223023,2010-06-11,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Allthough clean...Ridiculously small rooms” Was the room clean...yes, was the location great...yes...was the city great...of course
However, entering the room we were really disappointed. It was impossible to unpack both our bags, and sitting on the toilet with your nose almost pressed to the wall isn't fun either. In the elevator we heard several people acknowledge our feeling by calling (and i quote) it prison rooms and stating that the elevator is probably bigger than the room. 
I even heard some staff people say that their communication should be clear on the small rooms but state all the other advantages (bars) to avoid complaints.",Travelling_Belgium_,2010-06-01,223023,2010-06-24,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
“My wife and I just spent 5 nights at the...” My wife and I just spent 5 nights at the Hudson. Our experience was quite positive. We loved the Columbus Circle location which is very close to Central Park and a 15 minute walk to Times Square and the theatre district. The hotel is a real going concern as it houses a disco and a couple of very busy bars. Make sure that you stay on an upper floor to avoid hearing the noise from the courtyard bar. After reading the reviews we were ready for the extremely small rooms and I do mean small. However it was very clean and nicely designed. By the time we got back to our room each day after a busy few hours of activity the tiny rooms were never much of an issue. The concierge and the rest of the staff were very friendly and accomodating. I should probably mention that the hotel is very close to the subway lines which is very easy to use.,yikes1,2010-06-01,223023,2010-06-21,True,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

She heard that we had been on a long flight and gave us an upgrade to a larger room, very sweet as the rooms here are a tad tiny - but very comfortable. Contrary to what I have been reading our bed was very comfy, lighting was lacking a bit, I like it brighter but that's a personal choice. Location was excellent, very close to everything - easy walking distance to Time Square, and being right by Central Park is a plus.

"“Room Ruined the Experience” We have stayed in small, boutique hotel rooms in Manhattan before but this was ridiculously tiny! I believe it was 150 sf (or less) including the bathroom. Most of the complaints are around the room itself - slow draining tub, dim lights (could not read if you wanted to), dusty night tables (had build up that was not touched in the three nights we were there), the toilet was close enough to the wall that you could rest your head on the wall in front of you while sitting down (did not, but could have), very tiny bugs crawling on bathroom floor and in sink (so tiny they were almost imperceptible, which was disconcerting). The room service ""menu"" had breakfast, lunch, and dinner items all on one side of the menu. It was very expensive and nothing sounded especially appetizing. We arrived at the hotel early (around 12:30) and were told the room would be ready in about an hour. Long story short, we got our room at 4:30. While waiting we were told to have a drink on the outside terrace and to try the sangria. We ordered two glasses, but were told that a pitcher was a better deal and was three glasses. We were surprised to find that the pitcher held three glasses EACH and when the bill came it was for $55. So we spent $65 while waiting in the sweltering heat for our room! I noticed other couples with a pitcher in front of them and thought ""what a racket"". We will never forget our stay at this hotel, but we will definitely NOT recommend it to friends.

It was 11AM, and they refused to check me in because they said my name wasn't on the reservation (which had been made by his assistant). It was only under his name. I offered to show them my passport as well as his, but they refused. They told me I had to call him, which I tried to do but he was already in meetings and couldn't answer the phone. I asked if they would hold our luggage for the day while I waited for him to return, and they at first said no. After I threw a bit of a fit they finally agreed to hold our luggage, after which I was booted out onto the street to wander around for 5 hours waiting for him to return. Several hours later he was finally able to take a break and call them and ""authorize"" me on the reservation. I returned to the hotel around 5PM and they finally let me check in, but they gave me no apology. I told the snooty woman at the front desk that I wasn't aware that I needed to bring along my marriage license when I traveled. 
The room itself was tiny, you had to be a hobbit to use the toilet, and the bed was highly uncomfortable, but the worst part was the banging and clanking mechanical system which would kick in at random times throughout the night, rendering sleep impossible. That combined with the high rates, snobby and unhelpful staff, over priced everything and skimpy services ranks this hotel as the worst I have ever experienced. I wouldn't stay here again if it was the last hotel in NYC.",tenkon,2009-03-01,223023,2009-04-05,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great Value at $225 or less” This contemporary hotel has everything you need. While the rooms are tiny, they are notable for their efficient use of space and luxurious touches. The public spaces of the hotel are plentiful, and well equipped for doing business. Unlike many bargain hotels in New York, this one looks nice, has great linens and is a pleasure to come back to.
One nit would be the wait staff at breakfast: exceeding amounts of attitude. You would think that rather than (failing to) serving you coffee, they were tending the rope at a swanky club.

"“Rooms are too small even for NYC” I booked this hotel on http://priceline.com, and I still got a less less than what I paid for, they list this hotel as 3.5 stars, and it should be 3 at best.
The positives: very nice common areas.
The negatives: the size of the room was ridiculous, even by NYC standards. The inside cabin of a cruise ship is larger, need I say more? 
If you are single, less than 5'8"", and 130 lbs; you travel with a carry on only: you are not claustrophobic and are spending one night only; this might be a hotel for you. Also if you are considering committing a crime and are wondering if you could spend time in a jail cell, try this one first and see how it feels. 
This hotel was not for me as I am 5'10"", 155 lbs and hit my head many times with the TV, the bathroom door, the closet shelf, the chair, even with the bathroom wall (don't ask how).",AA2199,2010-06-01,223023,2010-07-02,False,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“terrible night; no sleep” I spent June 30 and July 1 in this hotel. Like the previous reviewer, I had a bad AC experience. The first night, I was awake most of the night because of the poor design of the AC. In addition, it really only cooled my head; there was little or no circulation to other parts of the (very) small room. However, in the middle of the night, I reversed position and put my feet under the AC and my head at the other end of the bed. That was marginally better, but I was by now too annoyed to sleep. The second night I repeated this position and I slept reasonably well.
I paid $115 for the room on Priceline and I was prepared for the size, dim light, general pecular nature of it all, but even for a good price, I would not return.",Nancy2005,2010-07-01,223023,2010-07-02,False,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Good value in a great location” This hotel is a fantastic option for those looking to do New York on a fairly tight budget, but who are not willing to 'rough it' in a youth hostel, or chance it in a less reputable hotel.
The only con is that the rooms are small. However, my boyfriend and I stayed four nights and we were comfortable enough. There isn't any room to unpack really, only minimal storage, so for longer stays I wouldn't recommend it, but for short stays its great. The rooms themselves are nicely done out, and very clean. They were also very quiet, despite parties being downstairs at the bar at all hours.
The location couldn't be faulted at all. Minutes from several subway stations, a walk to central park, and not far from midtown. We managed to walk nearly everywhere. The hotel is also very trendy. The various bars, and the fact that the hotel is popular lone for these, stops this feeling like a cheap hotel and make it feel far more expensive than it really was! The service was excellent also and helped maintain the trendy feel. 
I would reccomend this hotel to all couples - young or old, and families (provided you get a bigger room!) But i'd be careful if your planning on a long stay, or are planning on sharing a room with someone other than a significant other as they really are cosy!",hester86,2009-03-01,223023,2009-04-01,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Frustrating.” I really wanted to like this hotel - it is delightfully bizarre. The staff was at times very helpful; at others, not so much (like when I was trying to change a $100, and the lone front desk clerk didn't have access to the cash drawer!). The bars are quirky and fun, though sometimes off-limits due to private parties; but if you do get in, there may not be anywhere to sit. Everything but the room was expensive - the breakfast buffet costs twice what it rightfully should have. The room was about 1/3 the cost of a typical midtown room (via Hotwire) - but 1/4 the size. Internet access just didn't work. The heat was unnecessarily on at full blast in the hallways, which meant I had to have the A/C on in the room. Unfortunately, the HVAC unit is smack up against the head of the bed, and it's a compressor-based system; when it kicked on periodically during the night, it would jar me awake. 
The hotel cries out for a bit of management to better channel the efforts of the well-intentioned staff. As it stands, I would recommend it only for young people substantially more interested in a good time at a low cost than sleep or comfort.
At ""regular"" prices - like some of those I've seen quoted here (over $300???) - forget it.",opti-wan,2009-03-01,223023,2009-03-30,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great bar - shame about the rooms!” The bar in the Hudson is fantastic - really lively and a bit of a hot spot - I loved it but had one gripe which was that there was one night where we, even as guests in the hotel, really struggled to get in to the bar as we were not apparently on a list. Considering that a hotel should be a home from home whether you are on holiday or business I thought this was pretty poor service. Thankfully we were eventually let in but we then had to come out to speak to the bouncers so that a friend who was meeting us was allowed in. Madness - what is the point of having a bar in a hotel if you are not allowed to use it? (For any SATC fans I think its the same bar where Samantha ditches Smith and disappears upstairs with Richard.....) 
The rooms are tiny and there is just about enough room to walk around the outside of the bed - so if you are planning to do any shopping there isn't going to be a lot of room to store it in - be warned. I have stayed in other hotels in NY and you don't get much square footage for your money - but these rooms are ridiculous. If you just need somewhere where you can collapse on to the bed as soon as you open the door this is the hotel for you!
The bathrooms are really small - unless you are a size zero you are going to struggle to turn around and just so that you know - if you are staying in the same room as a friend or anyone other than a partner - they will be able to see you having a shower thanks to the glass walled bathroom.... ok if you don't mind showing your bits off but not for the shrinking violets among us! 
The gym is tiny as well in keeping with the theme of the hotel rooms - I wouldn't bother - just take your trainers and go for a run in the park instead.
Breakfast is good - served in a darkened room so if you have been up all night enjoying the bar no one should notice! 
I WOULD recommend it to a friend as its clean, a great location and a lively bar but if you want space try somewhere else.",LovetoshopLondon,2008-11-01,223023,2009-03-29,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Beautiful Lobby; Mediocre Everything Else” Truly a beautiful lobby entrance - dimly lit with many alcoves for solitude or love. But the front desk was EXTREMELY slow and not terribly concerned about that fact. This is one of the few hotels where not a single room was ready before the 3 PM check in time. There was little manifest effort to try to accommodate me otherwise. The room itself was quite small and not terribly intelligently laid out. It was clean and comfortable, but by no means special. The tiny laptop desk had NO OUTLETS nearby to plug stuff in. There were virtually no drawers, no minifridge, etc in my standard room.
The location is 1 block from Columbus Circle at Central Park. This was fine for me, but it is by no means a Times Square location. The subway was 1/2 block away; I liked that. 
I would stay there again if there was a deal for less than $180/night. Otherwise, I don't think it was worth it.",comicshrink,2010-06-01,223023,2010-07-02,False,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Unusual hotel with staff that go the extra mile.” We stayed overnight at the hudson on the way home from Hawaii. We were met by Mike at the door who gave us a lovely welcome and straight away organised our bags to be taken to the room, which was nice as we had arrived quite late in the evening and were quite tired. Upon entering the hotel up the lime green escalator I thought maybe I had made a mistake I was wrong. Upon entering reception our check in was dealt with by very friendly staff who offered a complimentary upgrade and we were in our room within minutes. Yes the room was smaller than some we had stayed in so maybe a standard room is very small. But the room was well equiped and clean with a comfy bed for our overnight stay. We quickly popped down to the restaurant to eat and both had a lovely meal cooked by the Chefs in the open kitchen. We didn't realise when booking it was St. Patricks day the next morning. We asked if we could store our bags as check iout normally 12.00, reception advised we could leave bags in our room until about 1.30 and to go and enjoy St. Patricks day parade this was really helpful and gave us a little more time to walk the 2 blocks down to 5th avenue to watch the parade which was just amazing. (if you are planning a trip to NY at this time of year try and be there for March 17th) Upon check out I got in the 'slow' queue, but it was noticed that I had been waiting longer than some and moved along which I thought was really nice. The hudson is not your normal Hilton/Hyatt etc. as it is a very individual hotel but the staff we encountered were so friendly helpful. Would we stay there again??

The rooms are small but they made good use of the space when they designed the hotel. The energy and excitement that emanates from the moment you walk in provides for an incredible experience. There are several areas to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of New York including the private garden, the sky terrace and library bar. The rooms are also a great place for two people to unwind and rest. There is no other hotel for me when I stay in New York.

"“Wish we'd listened to the other reviews...” ...we figured (like you might be) that we wouldn't spend much time in our hotel room as we'd be out sightseeing all day. Not having been to New York before, we chose the Hudson Hotel mainly for its location and price. No arguing that he location is great. And whilst we *were* out most of the day, when we got back to our hotel room, it was so incredibly small that all we could do was lie on the bed as there was nowhere else to sit, and no room to do anything. It was very frustrating, we even had to stand on the bed to get dressed. How we wished we'd listened to the people who said about the room size!!
The bathroom was hilarously tiny - when I was sat on the toilet, my knees were against the wall (I'm 5'4""). My 6' husband didn't find it so amusing. 
The halls are very dingy and depressing. There was an ice machine on our floor next to the lifts which for the 4 days we stayed there was leaking water all over the floor and down the corridor. The staff seemed very busy and stressed and the customer service suffered as a result.
In the lobby and bar, The Hudson is pretty passable and gets away with the 'chic urban' thing its trying to achieve, just don't go any further than the lift to the bedrooms as it will shatter those illusions.

"“Not as expected - very disappointed” My husband and I travelled to the US for our honeymoon. We have been to Miami, LA, Las Vegas and NY. We have checked the Hudson on their website before booking it, and it seemed amazing! Before arriving, I was sure that the Hudson was going to be the best hotel, out of the other hotels we stayed at throughout our trip. 
The website shows limited photos and hides the true picture of the place, especially the rooms. The reception was nice and we were excited that we have arrived at a good hotel. As soon as we took the elevator to our floor and walked through the corridor, we realized that the hotel was going to be a disappointment. The corridor carpets were old and the doors too. As soon as we opened the door to our room we were shocked: the room was very small, no cupboards, no space to open our luggage, it had a very small shower and toilette, small and old bed (noisy too!), very basic and depressing decoration, noisy and old air-conditioning system, and the noise from the street was very loud even though we were on the 10th floor. We had to buy ear plugs in order to be able to sleep in the evening! 
The hotel has two nice bars, both outside, which we have visited and enjoyed. But the restaurant was nothing special. And the room very bad, for the money we paid.

"“Trendy hotel in a great location” I lived in NYC for almost twenty years and usually stay at the Washington Square Hotel in Greenwich Village. I booked the Hudson because we found a fantistic rate of $149 a night over the frigid MLK weekend in January. I'd been to the hotel for drinks before, and knew that it was a bit of a scene, but as a hotel, it definitely did not disappoint. When we arrived, the staff was extremely pleasant, and we were actually upgraded. So the room, while not huge, was much larger than the one we'd booked. The room was hip and modern in terms of design, but some might find the heating to be noisy. Having lived in NY, I am familiar with noisy water heat in old buildings, but if you are not, you will likely find it to be noisy. Again, for $149, this hotel was a steal; at $350 a night, we may have found it to be too much. When you return at night, the lobby will have turned into a loud nightclub, due to the two popular lobby bars. You either like that or you don't, but our room was on a high floor and there was no problem with noise from the lobby at all. We had drinks at the Library Bar, which were expensive, but no more so than other hotels in NYC. Also, it would be great if they offered free wireless; it is $10 per night. But, in terms of location, it is right off of Columbus Circle and Central Park. While I never lived in that neighborhood, it is a very pleasant, central place to stay for a long weekend.

"“Smallest hotel room we ever stayed in” On the positive side, this hotel has a great location, a beautiful lobby and nice terraces. The room was clean. I suggest stopping by The Hudson, seeing the lobby and having a drink on the terrace AND THEN LEAVING!
The room was uncomfortably small. I am not exaggerating! There was no room to move around. In the bathroom, there was a bath mat, theoretically to put down on the floor, but there was not enough floor to put it down on! Also, the bed was so low to the floor that it was hard to get into or out of it! The hallways are dark and ugly. The elevators were extremely slow!!

"“It's Not As Bad As The Rest of the Reviews Here Suggest” My wife and I decided to take a short break in New York, first time away from the kids so we wanted to make sure we had a good time of it. Booked this hotel using Priceline's ""name your price"" and got the room for $110 (+fees) per night which we were happy with... that was until we started reading reviews panning this place into oblivion. We expected the worst and we pleasantly surprised to find it not to be that bad at all.
Yes it is dark inside but so what... if you wear sunglasses inside, you're an idiot, if you don't wear sunglasses inside, you're fine!
Yes it is pricey to grab a drink in the bar or eat... so eat out, it's not like there's not much choice.
Yes the staff are young (and restless?) but we found everyone to be really friendly and helpful from the doormen to the concierge to the checkin staff to the checkout staff... even the maid's seemed really friendly always saying ""Hi"" as you passed them, although we didn't really stop to chat.
Yes the rooms are tiny but unless you're grossly overweight or plan on spending all your time in New York pining away in your room (in which case there really is no help for you!)... the rooms are perfectly fine.
Yes the beds are low... erm... I'm not sure what the problem is... if you can't get out of a bed that is a little lower to the ground than the average bed, you probably shouldn't be travelling unaccompanied!
The Good
The exceptionally small rooms are surprisingly well laid out and had lots of nice little touches that either made them seem larger or added to the overall usability of the room. E.g. ipod dock with speakers, mirrored walls (nudge, nudge, wink, wink), LCD TV built into the mirrored wall, window to the bathroom from the bedroom (allows for lots of light to get in and makes both rooms feel airier (is that a word?).
The rooms are very clean
The room has controllable and responsive heating system
Nice little nook for a closet, big enough to fit a medium suitcase, opened on the fold out standThe hotel is modern and pretty classy
Bathroom is stocked with fancy shampoos and soaps (not that I used any of it)
Location is great, a 15 minute walk from Times Square, a 3 minute walk from Central Park
The Bad
No getting away from it the rooms are small but they are still functional and comfortable for a short visit
The windows are not really sound proof... we were on the 14th Floor and by 6:30am the hustle and bustle outside were clearly audible (but then again, if I was asleep I probably wouldn't have noticed... I'm an early riser)
The HVAC is noisy, every time it kicks in it seems like every component inside the unit behind the headboard jumps 2 inches to the right and flaps open randomly (RECOMMEND - turn the heating down so it doesn't come on as often)
The mini bar was extortionately priced... $4.50 for a small bottle of water... luckily there are plenty of shops close by so stock up on food and drink from the outside if you think you might be tempted to eat/drink in the room
High Speed wireless internet available for $10 a day... why do hotels insist on charging for this still? It should be a freebie.
Although pleasant, the concierge was misinformed on a couple of things... e.g. we wanted to purchase a New York Pass (gets you access to tons of attractions including all the main ones) for a low price (we paid $99 for 2 days and definitely got our money's worth), however, we asked the concierge if we could buy one at the Circle Line Cruise place (Pier 83) and we were told no and that the best place to get them was in Times Square... consequently we didn't have time to get to Times Square, grab tickets and get to Pier 83 for a 10am cruise... turns out that a) the place in Times Square was not a main office and only had 1 ticket left for sale b) we walked past a main office (Gray Line office 47th and 8th) on the way to Times Square only to have to walk back c) we could have bought the tickets from Pier 83 and thus made the 10am cruise after all!!!
The Ugly
No show stoppers... all the bad stuff (above) are minor inconveniences but nothing that would make me not want to stay here... that said, if you're married to a big fat lass or a big fat lad, the mirrored walls and window from the main room into the shower could be a little off putting... luckily the window has a curtain on both sides so you can close them to protect your eyes and as for the mirrored walls, you can either close your eyes or turn the light off... or just be happy with the person your with and enjoy the ride (if you excuse the pun!)

"“surpassed expectations” Before going to New York last september we were thinking about cancelling our reservation at the Hudson because of the many reviews saying that the rooms were small, but then we decided to give it a try.
The hotel is amazing, the room (dlx double double) was very nice, with a good size (it had two double beds, a little tv room and a normal bathroom).
It's definitely worth staying there. I like it and would recommend it.
Even the restaurant there had a good food, and it's worth the price.
Recently I've been trying to contact them by email but got no responses. If anyone has the manager, or someone else's email (from the hotel), please tell me.

"“Don't do it!” Stayed for 5 nights to celebrate birthday and 4th July. Hotel has great facilities for drinking and eating, but the rooms are extremely small, with very little light coming thru. However, the biggest reason for not staying here are the staff attitude, unfortunately. They added tips on every bill without us adding or signing for it, we only discovered this after seeing the final bill at check out and having to insist on seeing every individual bill, even then they tried to insist this was in their T&C's.

“Cool but very very small” There are much better hotels in NYC than the Hudson. The place is a complete fire trap and terribly dark and black.

"“Scary Spookhouse Ride” The Hudson is less of a hotel than a dark, rough fun house ride by design impostor Philipe Starck. A flickering two-foot high gas torch marks the entrance. Its flames crack the surrounding concrete of the Soviet-style mausoleum façade. Walk sideways in front of the glass to enter - it confuses everyone - and ascend the shoulder-wide three-story escalator to a green-lit low beam lobby entrance. The lobby is practically unlighted and paneled in faux dark wood. The pleasant tee-shirted staff have an attitude of corporate-enforced peppiness. They know you'll be calling about the 15,000 decibels of pulsating bass that makes its way up through the ventilation to your room several floors above. Lurch into the small crowded elevator and hope you can find the right button before you pass your floor. If you manage to see the button in dark, it may be partly covered by the textured wood paneling. 
As you creep down the narrow charcoal-painted hallways, your back crimps with anticipation at what lies beyond the door to your room. Your animal instincts serve you well. It is not a room - it is a paneled cell, sheathed in more of the same dark fake wood paneling. Do not drop any small valuables. You will not find them again in the dark corners. As everywhere else in the Hudson, the ornamental lighting actually impairs vision. Mr. Starck, a maker of bath faucets and blow molded plastic goods, has managed to backtrack on ninety years of progress in lighting design since Poul Henningsen developed efficient, soft illumination; Starck's weird ornamental fixtures manage to provide glare without illumination. And watch out in the bathroom! because the toilet is only 16 inches from the wall. If you don't bang your shins on your way into the kinky glass shower (please don't ask), you'll smack your head into the tiles when you sit on the pot. Owww. Better slide to the bottom of the bed than getting out on the right side because the wall-mounted TV is waiting to separate your shoulder.
Now for that 1:30 AM call to the front desk to get them to turn down the Pink Floyd in concert in the bar. The operator says ""no problem"", the hotel manager will speak to the bar manager. Nodding off 25 minutes later in spite of the noise, the hotel security desk calls to inquire about my complaint. Another five minutes later, the front desk calls back to inquire whether the noise level is better. Now it's two in the morning. Is this punishment for the noise complaint? Thanks for the calls. When I speak to the desk manager in person the following day, I am told, between enthusiastic handshakes, that there is no substitute room available for me and that the hotel had vacated the fourth floor as a buffer floor but he would speak to the bar manager… What kind of Hotel keeps its guests awake with loud night club music?!
The poor staff - probably artists, writers, grad students, actors - ask timidly ""have you enjoyed your stay"" and start to apologize before the answer comes. The rooms are not merely small. They are walk-in closets. The whole place is dark and unbearably loud. All very exhausting. Of course you should not stay here.

"“Beautiful but overpriced” For a hotel of this rating I was surprised at the unhelpfulness of the staff over the phone, the long queues at check-in and the brisk nature of the staff. 
The Hudson is a beautiful hotel, as all the reviews suggest, the location is great (across from Columbus circle) but for the price I would expect more; even in NYC. 
There is no doubt the rooms are small, the bathrooms even smaller and with two suitcases we could barely move around the room and instead had to crawl over the bed. For those bigger than average size/height I would not recommend it. 
Would I stay again, probably not; I would however visit the bars (the one on the 15th floor does have amazing views of the city) and the bar on ground level is particularly lovely.",TipTopTilly,2010-07-01,223023,2010-07-10,False,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Past Glory” We have stayed at Hudson about once a year the past five or so years. The location is perfect for us and we have long ago come to peace with the small rooms. However, this time we were really taken back how worn out the hotel has become. 
We saw two rooms on the 11th floor and both had severe water/leakage damages in the ceiling: discolouring and cracks. We finally setteld on the 9th floor where the bathroom ceiling also had clear water damage. 
I understand if there is no budget to make-over rooms but some maintenance must be possible?
- toiletroll holder that is about to fall off
- rusty studs on upholstered chairs
- cracked and stained bathroom tiles
- towels that are long due their crispy white days
- not to mention the hallways that though dimly lit, show bad signs of wear and tear
It gave us the impression nobody cares about the premises. So despite our very-friendly frontdesk person (not always given at Hudson) next year we will be checking-in somewhere else.

"“ABNORMALLY SMALL ROOMS” I have been to NYC on many occasion, and have had the priviledge of staying at 3 - 5 star hotels. This hotel is by far the smallest, and loudest hotel I have ever stayed in. The bathroom was the size of a bath tub, the bedroom must have been less than 100 sq ft...The staff asked us if we wanted to upgrade, and the upgrade room wasn't that much bigger....

"“Loved my one night stay” Thanks to Priceline, I got an amazing deal. Thanks to an attentive, friendly, professional staff, I had an amazing experience! Due to my physical disability, they updated me to a larger room with an accessible shower and kindly provided the shower chair. 
The Ian Schraeger decor, was elegant, fun, funky/mod eye candy. The airy, exposed brick atrium/lobby, complete with climbing ivy, gives the space an open Meditterranean, relaxed feel. 
 I would recommend The Hudson for persons with disabilities because of the accomodating staff. I would also recommend that any person(s) with disabilities make sure (if possible) to make any special requests when booking the room. Don't wait until arrival, as it's a very busy hotel, and you may not get what you need.
Potential draw backs of the Hudson: 
For able bodied travelers: regular rooms are very small based on the dorm room/pod style, which translates to entire room being an 150 square foot size MAXIMUM.
Internet pricing in the business center is a tad bit pricey for the time allowed. Business center is also a bit tricky to find.
Lobby lighting is dim, mood lighting, so although there are stylish chairs and tables to relax in, it can be hard to read maps, menus, etc,. Also, on weekend nights, the lobby can be a bit crowded and loud. During my stay the restaurant(s) was/were under renovation.
The neighborhood where the Hudson is located, between 8th and 9th Ave, is not my favorite. It's a bit far over on the West Side. However, it is much, much safer than it was 25 + years ago, when I worked in the same bldg, where The Hudson is now housed, as a college intern!

"“Fabulous hotel and perfect location” I recently stayed at the Hudson Hotel with my best friend. We were in New York for 5 days of shopping and sight seeing. We were a little bit concerned about the hotel because we had read in reviews that the rooms were tiny and it was very dark everywhere.
When we arrived the staff were very friendly and our room was lovely...yes it was small but believe me for the amount of time you spend in it it was perfect. 
The location was amazing with a subway station at the end of the street and Times Square only a few blocks or a short subway ride away. 
It was dark inside but it was all part of the ambience of the hotel.
We didn't eat in the restaurant because there are so many other places to eat but we did use the bar. On Saturday night it turns into a nightclub with a great atmoshere and people even come in from the street to have a drink and party because it's so nice. 
Overall I would highly recommend the Hudson hotel for a city break.",newyorkprincess9001,2009-02-01,223023,2009-02-26,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great value, very cool hotel” We stayed for one night on the 4th of July. Our primary reason for picking this hotel was to be able to see the fireworks from the sky terrace which is only for hotel guests and people with table reservations. We arrived around noon, they did not have a room for us but gave us cards in case we wanted to charge anything to the room, and held our luggage. We went out for lunch and returned at 3pm, and our room was ready for us.
The lobby is very cool and amazing. Not like anything I've seen before. This hotel gets high marks for design throughout. The game room/library is impressive and large, the courtyard is very pretty and relaxing, and the sky terrace is amazing. There are lots of chairs and great views all around. We did not see nor use the gym. The hotel restaurant, Hudson Hall, is a very interesting and unique design. We had breakfast there and it was fantastic! A little pricey but totally worth it.
The room is small, but this should not surprise anyone as they clearly state the square footage on their website. We had a standard queen and it was fine for the two of us, with room for luggage, hanging clothes, and shelf storage. They make efficient use of a small space. The bed seemed a little small but we slept well. We did not hear any noise from adjacent rooms or the hallway, even though it was a holiday and the place seemed quite full. Hallways are a bit dark and ""moody"", I don't see why people complain about it. They are creating a mood with the colors and dim lighting. The vending machine setup on each floor is very cool - disguised behind some chic closet doors near the elevators. Nice touch!
The location of this hotel is perfect. You are steps from Central Park, Time Warner building, 5th Ave, subways, etc. We made the most of the location by enjoying all of the nearby attractions including taking a walk by the cruise ships on the river. We went to the sky terrace for the fireworks, it was really amazing. The staff did a great job of making sure access was restricted to the right people, and it never got too crowded up there. The bartenders were working their butts off to get everyone drinks (making labor intensive things like mojitos, from scratch) and they were still friendly and accommodating, even though it was about 90 degrees and 25 people were on line for drinks. 
All hotel staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. I would describe the staff as laid back (in a good way), and completely without the (I'm really a model) attitude you sometimes encounter in stylish hip NY hotels. Check in and check out were a breeze.
They offer valet parking for $55/24 hours but there is a garage just steps away where 24 hours is only $30, so if don't have too much luggage you might want to park there and save a little money.
I thought this hotel was an excellent value, excellent location, and I would definitely stay again.

The room is minimal but if you like that decor, which I do, then it's great. To me it's cleaner to have wood floors. Our A/C didn't work as many others have said. You would think the guy who came up to look at it might have mentioned that the windows opened! Our room was never cleaned but since I extended our stay they may not have realized that we were staying another night. The internet was $10/24 hours and I don't consider that excessive at all.

Most of my time was spent visiting friends in the city and it was nice to come back to a beautiful room. The bed was fantastic. The size of the room was perfect.

It's not only that the public spaces of the hotel are magnificent, I loved my room. Yes, it is small. Yes, I was traveling by myself. However, I would have been more than happy to have shared the space with my boyfriend. I loved the design of the room—everything easily accessible—and the style of the space, from the desk, bed, to the wood paneled walls, was just right. Even more I loved the bathroom. It was small but super sexy. I'm sure I'm one of the demographics that this hotel is trying to appeal to, young, gay, and a urbanite.

"“Mixed feelings” We booked the Hudson for our honeymoon to NYC. After booking I read reviews on Tripadvisor and started to worry....
On arrival the front desk staff where fairly helpful, we had a pre-arrangement regarding the deposit that was made between the manager and our travel agent and the receptionist refused to believe me even when I showed her e-mail confirmation and I had to ask her to check with the manager. When she did this everything was fine. 
As a honeymoon couple we got our room upgraded - so everything I'd read about the rooms being very small wasnt really relevant to us. Our room was still on the small side, but was more than adequate for our needs. The only issue was the lack of lighting - even the light in the bathroom wasnt very good, so putting on your make-up was quite a struggle! 
On our first night we were hit with some strange banging noises coming from the wall (which looked out over the roof of the reception area), it sounded like pipes banging, so we assumed it was from the room above us shower or sink. it stopped after the second night, so we didnt mention it to the staff. 
The best thing about the hotel is its location. Right near central park and columbus circle which is perfect for catching the subway to whereever you need to go really. And round the other corner leads you to Hell's Kitchen and lots of resturants if you didnt want to venture too far to eat. 
One afternoon we had a coffee in the library - $15 for two coffees seemed rather extremem to me, as did the $20 something my husband paid for 2 bottles of lager. The resturant wasnt open at the time of our stay, which was a shame as it would have been nice to be able to come down for breakfast a couple of mornings. 
All in all, our stay wasnt spoiled by the hotel, but at the same time we wouldnt say that the hotel added to our experience either.

"“Front desk staff fantastic, maintenance not great” I'd stayed at the Hudson before, so I knew I was getting a teeny, tiny room, which was fine. However, it doesn't look like the hotel rooms have been updated in the 8 years or so between my hotel stays. The mattress was getting well used, and probably needed to be replaced. My room faced the courtyard/ bar, and you could definitley hear music until the wee hours of the morning.
I ended up calling down at least 3 times for maintenance to fix water leaking in my bathroom. The front desk staff were great about it - they tried to locate someone, and when it took a long time to locate mantenance (who never did fix the problem), they provided some drinks and eventually a room change for me. The second (upgraded) room was fantastic - much bigger, and it felt very luxurious. 
I'm not sure I'd recommend the hotel for solo travellers. I usually like to sit at the hotel bar if I'm having a meal, and there's no bar (or no bar that I could find) to sit at.",caycay_can,2010-06-01,223023,2010-07-30,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“The bar is coolio but the bedrooms are not!” The Hudson is a great hotel to visit for a drink on your visit to New York. The bars are really cool, I would not however, stay there again. The rooms are just way too small, the beds small and the matress lumpy and thin and very near to the floor.
The bathroom is so small you could not get two adults in at once and people kept trying the doors during the evening... Not safe if you are a woman on your own - that may because we stayed Thurs through to Saturday night.

"“Amateur Hour: Sensible People Do Not Stay Here” This hotel at best is a 2 start hotel.
This hotel, and the other hotels that Morgans, the parent company owns have beautiful bars, lounges and restaurants. However, the Hotel Rooms at the Hudson: Thee main component that defines a hotel, are HORRIBLE. They are so ridiculously small, so impractical and just outright insulting. In addition the furnishings are cheap, and the rooms were not super clean. Thus, I must conclude, people who live with common sense, would never tolerate such a disaster. Trust fund babies, club kids, and drug addicts would love it here. Because you would simply get drunk in the lounge and not care what the size of the room is, when you pass out. The staff is ultra-snobby and unorganized. A colleague was trying to call the hotel for 6 hours to reach me, and there was no one at the desk to pick up the phone. He went on their website and called their toll-free reservation line, who left him on hold, saying they would get through to the front desk, only to hang up on him after 90 minutes of being on hold!

"“Seriously!!!!! Cheap not Chique” Pros. This hotel is idealy situated. Central Park is seconds away as well as Time Square. Easy access to the subway and a short walk to the 46th street restaurant area. The hotel is trendy if that is important to you, however an experienced traveller will not fall for the flash. This is a hotel that wants to be a nightclub. If you came to sightsee, good news, this hotel will make you want to get you out onto the street as quickly as possible
Cons. The hotel room was exceedingly uncomfortable. The size of the room is ridiculously small. The shower is so small that you can't move without shower curtains rubbing against you on two sides. If you want bathroom privacy forget it there simply is none. If you sit on the toilet your knees will hit the wall in front of you. The dimensions of the room including the bathroom are 10 ft wide by 16 ft long. There is litterally know where to move. I am 5 ft 8 inches and my wife is 5 ft 2 inches tall, we are not big people. If you are tall, overweight or even average height you must avoid booking this hotel. The room we booked was a queen bed room and we were told that this room is not the smallest room offered. Seriously!!! They have smaller rooms? If the Hotel was attempting to creat a trendy chique atmospher they almost nailed it, however I booked a hotel room not a nightclub cubby. The owner does not have a clue how to run a hotel. You could in know way rate this hotel any higher than 2 star. It simply lacks an environment condusive to finding rest and relaxation. The walls are so thin you can hear conversations in the rooms on either side of your room and the door to the room is fitted so poorly that you can see light from the hallway. You can hear everyone coming and going from their rooms . We stayed in room 907 and when you look up at the ceilig from your bed you can see a water damage patch job that looks like it was done by a very inexperienced tradesman.

"“small and dark” I stayed here for one night on an international layover. Thank goodness I was by myself, the room is incredibly small, dark and noisy from the nightclub below. The bathroom is unbearbly cramped. I will not stay here again nor will I book on Priceline again as this room advertised the same rate on thier website that I paid on Priceline with the ""name your price"" option. For what you pay this hotel is NOT worth it. It felt like I was on an old cruise ship with a small stateroom near the nightclub!

"“Many misses very few hits.” When a hotel puts style over function, you know as a traverler you are in trouble. It was difficult to locate the hotel because there was address or name on the building. You just had to guess you were at the Hudson. Going up the lime green entrance to the lobby is a wonderful experience. However gettting a room from the staf is like trying to get into a the hot night club with a difficult bouncer at the door. They need to work on their people skiills. 
I stayed in queen bed room with was a little smaller then the cabin I stayed in on a cruise ship the week before. These are the areas that are great misses and not hits once you get into your room.
1. The glass wall between the shower and the bedroom area. (Staff call this a beep a boo shower). Families DO NOT stay here unless you do not mind your children seeing mommy or daddy taking a shower.
2. There are no draws in this room. Either you hang up everthing or keep it in your suitcase. 
3. Sink in the bathroom has no counter surface. You have to put your stuff on the toilet in order for you to have it near you.
4. Hopefully you are not near the floor of the nightclub. If you are, you will NOT get any sleep..
5. Rooms were clean but the hallways are very warm. NO AC in the hallways",nalaspapa,2010-07-01,223023,2010-07-27,False,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“GREAT LOCATION - UPGRADED ROOM” The hotel as previous reviewers have mentioned does not have an address on the building but if you look at the pictures of the outside it is hard to miss and just a block west of 8th Avenue. The florescent lime green coloured escalotor to the concierge denotes the feeling that this isn't your typical hotel. The concierge area is dark but designed somewhat art deco with traditional mega chandeliers with light bulbs stuck to the tiers, there is a canopy of green that looks like combat camouflage enclosing the lobby as to not bring in the light from outside. Previous viewers mentioned that check-in was slow, not for us. There was 3 people on the desk and we were the only ones to check-in. We had booked our room on priceline for $150 a night for a Queen room, I knew the room was going to be small so asked about an upgrade. For an extra $100 a night we got a loft room on the 23rd floor, it was a corner suite with three exposures a living room area, bedroom area and two closets. The bathroom however was still small but suited the purpose. Although we didn't spend much time in the room, the afternoon break between sightseeing was nice in this spacious space with an amazing view. Very comfortable. The beds are ok, they are futon style. The pillows however are fluffy down filled and we had 10 of them. The room included, a safe, iron, mini bar, flat screen tv w/satellite viewing, bathrobes, aveda products and a small writing/computer desk. I think internet was $10 a day but we didn't use it. There is an apple store in Columbus Circle if you need to check something for free. Each floor has ice/food vending machines by the elevators. The elevators did move fast never waited more then a couple of minutes. Didn't try the restaurants since you are a close walk to 9th ave and there is ample cheap food finds there. The library bar was fun for a drink, so was the outside terrace (had one cocktail in each, a bit expensive $16 for a Sangria). The location can't be beat it is a close walk to Times Square/Central Park/Broadway etc. The subway entrance is across the street. There was a definate mix of young hipsters and middle age tourist (we are the latter). To end we did see our first room before upgrading just to see what small was!! The regular rooms are very small and if I had to stay there for 5 nights I don't think I would have been very delighted. If i was younger and on a budget it probably would have suited us quite fine for $150/night.",skylady,2010-07-01,223023,2010-07-25,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hip, Trendy and incredibly dark!” Ok - so you read many of these reviews and you will be worried that your room is going to be tiny. Two responces to this one - firstly, does that really matter as you cant see the size of a room when you are asleep - and the other one responce ...... try any London hotel and you will learn what small REALLY is!
Seriously - yes, the rooms are modest in size, but they are absolutly fine. I really liked the minimalist approach to things. Hard floor, wooden panel walls, simple clean lines everywhere. The room was spotless, cool and had everything I needed for a stay in NYC. 
The lobby, lifts and corridors are INCREDIBLY dark, so if like me you have glasses with colour changing lenses in them, then the first few minutes back in the hotel while the glasses go back to completely clear are amusing as you wont be able to see anything!
The green/yellow perspex decor in the lobby / bar is comptemporary glam and actualy pleasantly quirky.
The 15th floor room terrace is a WONDERFUL find (although gut wrentchingly expensive .... be warned!). It is covered in sofas, hammocks and funky chairs and is a great place to relax, but you may find it hard to find a space as it is popular. 
And...... it has to be said, EVERYONE who works at this hotel is very good looking and seems to epsnd most their lives in a gym.
I would recommend this as a place to stay - esp if (like me) you got it on PriceLine for only $80 per night!",musicmanbrain,2010-07-01,223023,2010-07-25,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Small Rooms, But There is More” It is true that the hotel rooms in NYC are small unless you are spending big bucks. A lot of what you have read in these reviews is true about the Hudson, but there is more to the hotel experience than a small room. The location is excellent, the staff caring, the beds comfortable.
My room was not much larger than an expansive walk-in closet, but it was thoughtfully laid out and everything was clean. The bathroom was easy to navigate around in and had a near full size tub. Fluffy white towels. The room had a double bed and there was room enough to walk around. No way would a stroller work in there, but one or two people and room is fine. If you have more than one suitcase, you may have a problem. It was quiet and on the 14th floor. TV, but no DVD. After a day out on the town, the bed was comfortable and I just sank into those pillows.
The restaurant served breakfast cafeteria style as one option and I had a problem with this. Someone kept taking my order! After the confusion, the pancakes are a must try. They were so tasty and just the right size. An order of bacon was just one strip though.
The lobby is dark and for some of us this is puzzling, but there is a lot of activity at all times, even early in the morning. There are lots of places to sit in the lobby, lots of music, loud downstairs, but quiet in the rooms.
For the amount of room space the hotel seems overpriced, but I had the parking package which made the room more reasonably priced, especially considering how close it was to Central Park and Columbus Circle, taxis, subways, buses. Easy and safe walking distance, even at night. Parking in NYC in that area runs around $55 a night.

"“Funky boutique style hotel” The spaces are tiny - barely room to swing a cat! Much too small for 2 adults and a teenager so we got another room. We checked in around midnight and practically walked through their nightclub to get to their front desk. The place was hopping! We worried that we would here the thumping base but were pleasantly surprised at how quiet the rooms were - just the din of the street noise - totally expected.
Phillipe Starck's imprint is very evident. Clean lines - nice! Had an excellent nights sleep despite the rattling air conditioning unit. 
Great cafe around the corner and very convenient to the hotel.

"“Pleased with the upgrade!” OK! The website for this hotel does a good job in selling it; however please don’t accept a confirmation of booking as a guarantee. I initially attempted to book on-line, but instead I phoned the hotel in New York directly. I had spoken to a friendly lady, who talked highly of the hotel and made my reservation. She proceeded to take my credit card details and then she sent me an email as confirmation of payment. It was on my arrival to the hotel that it was made clear to me that the pre-payment was not taken and the email I received meant nothing, although my room was still reserved. I then attempted to use the same card and it was blocked by my bank. It wasn’t the hotel’s fault; but they didn’t offer their phone for me to phone my bank in the UK, thus creating a sizable phone bill for me. I complained and as it was both mine and my friend’s Birthdays, we were offered an up-grade on the room, although I would hate to know what size a standard room was like! Aside from all that, everything else was OK, but we did buy our own alcohol and had taken it into the hotel, as the hotel’s bars were very expensive. Also, the bars in the hotel didn’t have much atmosphere and were quiet – we went elsewhere. The people on the door made a habit of turning the men away and packed the bar(s) full of women, a typical US marketing idea that doesn’t work. It’s a fancy hotel, but don’t expect value for money.

"“We liked it” So the rooms are about as small as a room can be, so be prepared for it like we were and you won't be disappointed! The bed was pretty small, but the linens were good enough.

Service: We had one incident where the maid took a white top from our room by accident, but we never got it back and this wasn't followed up and the staff didn't seem to care. We went out on the roof terrace and we waited about 20mins to get served (it was a nice wait, though!)

“Hip and happening but no substance” Arriving at this place we really didn't think it was a hotel - it is a most bizarre entrance with an escalator up to reception. This is touted as the place to see and be seen - which I'm sure it is...it's just very expensive for the smallest of rooms (we paid $469 per night over new year for a room only marginally bigger than the bed!).

"“Cramped, Clean, Great Location” First the positives...It's a wonderful location. Being close to a main subway hub, central park and many places to eat is a big plus. The rooms were clean and well stocked. We were on the 4th floor and didn't find it at all noisy.The negatives...Extremely small room and bathroom. Two people couldn't begin to fit in the bathroom at the same time (unless one is in the shower). Walking around the room is only accomplished if the other person moves out of your way. The check-in and check-out is unorganized. This is so easily resolved by stating a line to get in to to complete this process, but hasn't been done. Wake up management! Would I recommend this hotel? Yes, but then again with the use of the subways, you have no need to be close to anything, because the subways are so fast and efficient in getting you to where you have to go.

"“totally cool experience” My wife and I came to new york for my 50th birthday,and thanks to my wife choosing to stay at the Hudson,it made the trip a memorable experience.
Immediately when entering the building you notice how unusual and cool the place is,and how reports of it being dark and moody are quite true but not disturbing.The music/furniture/fittings/bare brickwork/ wooden floors really blend together to create a relaxed feel to the place. Without any hesitation, the staff,all young and extremely courteous,checked us in and we were allocated our room.After having a cocktail in the library room first (awesome)we went to our room (queenstandard)which was compact but really nice.3 nights later though,due to a slight problem with the heating in the room we asked for another room and were upgraded to a deluxe studio on the 23rd flr which was superb,if you can get into one of these or higher, the views are great with more space to move about.Room service was quick and efficient, both supper and breakfast were very good.The restaurant again had a creative menu and was very busy during our stay.All in all we would have no hesitation coming back to the Hudson again when in New York.",HarveyMoonChester,2009-01-01,223023,2009-02-19,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Modern Hotel” When you first see the hotel from the outside it looks nothing special, with the flames burning at night on the weekends. But go up the yellow lighted escalators to reception and be prepared to be amazed at the design. A picture is attached to my review, but be aware that the corridors are just a dimly lit.
Free vend pool table, which is great to pass away an hour.
As other travelers stated, the basic rooms are small. You can just move around the room. I had booked three rooms of which the last was upgraded and more than twice as big. Excellent location, just 5 mins walk from Central Park. 
My only issues were the room safe was not attached to anything, so I could have locked something away, but the burglar could have walked off with the safe!!! I explained this to reception, but in the usual process driven way there was nothing they could do unless I was in the room, how stupid!!

"“Too hip for me” One wonders if Phillipe Starck watched a Tim Burton film festival before designing the public spaces of this hotel. They are striking to look at -- but very, very dark. Hallways are cave-like. Lighting in the front reception area resembles that inside a movie theatre while the feature is showing. Good luck trying to read -- or even to see the face of your companions -- while seated in the lobby, 
Unlike other reviewers, I was not shocked by the small size of our room -- dimensions are accurately portrayed on the firm's website, and I've stayed in smaller rooms in Europe. The room was clean, stylish, and (somewhat surprisingly) quiet. But it was very snug, and not configured in a way to make computer work or even reading practical, unless one were to do it on the bed. Style often trumps rather than facilitates function here.
The hotel is probably ideal for party-hearty 20 somethings, who will enjoy the throbbing hip-hop music that plays in the elevators at night, but older people who enjoy light and space are better off elsewhere.",otberbur,2009-02-01,223023,2009-02-17,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Location is great, yes the rooms are small, but it's NY” Like other reviewers I agree the rooms were small, but we knew that having read the trip advisor reviews.
Along with small rooms, there were a couple of other things that could have improved our stay. The down escalotor to street level was broken, and it wasn't that clear how to get out... other than use the lift.
Gym equipment was broken and there are no toilets on the gym level.
Breakfast is expensive for the choice/range you get. 
What you can't fault is the location. First timers to NY we loved the location of this hotel, as we walked to so many things and found the area safe and easy to get to.
Although the room was small it was comfortable, very clean, quiet and the toiletries of good quality. Besides we weren't in our room other than to sleep.
They also make very good use of the small space and what they manage to get in. Although I suggest you pull both the curtains in the bathroom, so you can't see in from the bedroom!

"“Mixed feelings” Great location for Central Park, Lincoln Center and the Broadway theater land. Some nice design features, such as the large open-air terrace on the first floor. There is another terrace on the 15th floor with bar, sun loungers and great views over the city and down to the Hudson River (most welcome as temperature at 6pm was still 35 (95) degrees. Staff generally very friendly and helpful (and all dressed in regulation black T shirts - this is a designer hotel after all)
My room was very small (OK for single occupancy and a short stay) but talking with a business associate who used to stay at the Hudson other and more expensive rooms aren't that much larger either. The air con unit was located right behind my bed's headboard and had to be turned off during the night. The breakfast room is horrible (unless you want to be surrounded by noisy, wall-to-wall television and American-style early morning 'news' (at least it was CNN and not Fox).

"“Quite literally the worst hotel I have ever experienced. Disappointing on every level!” I stayed at the Hudson with my husband in late July for the wedding of a friend. We stayed in a block of approximately 70 rooms and every single person who stayed at the hotel had serious issues. Let's start with my experience:
We entered the hotel through the finger print smudged front doors and rode up the depressing escalator to a sort of, almost cool lobby. Then we were directed through the crowd of wanna-be trendoids to the front desk. Be aware there is no security at this hotel so anyone in the lobby or at the bar can roam throughout the guest floors at any time. Our check in was reasonably smooth.
After walking down a dark, hot hallway with peeling paint that smelled distinctly of urine, we reached our room (Rm 416). It was tiny even by New York standards - even by European standards! - but that was the least of the problems. The bed was essentially a wooden board with uncovered, unpadded springs which made sleeping impossible. The air conditioner is located directly behind the headboard so a stream of freezing cold air pours over the headboard uncomfortably on to your face but doesn't actually cool off the rest of the room. Noise from the pathetic, pseudo-trendy bar is inescapable, and the bathroom, in addition to being so tiny your knees hit the wall if you use the toilet, was filthy. The shower grout and drain were coated with mold and the drain backed up as soon as the water was turned on. 
Needless to say, at 6:00am the next morning my husband went to the front desk to complain. Luckily the gentleman at the desk was helpful and apologetic (incidentally, he was not at all surprised by the complaints) and upgraded us to a ""deluxe"" room for the remainder of our stay. He told us to leave our bags packed in the room and they would be transferred to our new room by the 3:00pm re-check in time.
When I re-checked in at 3:30pm, I asked the front desk if our luggage had already been delivered as I had a wedding related party to get to at 4:15pm and I was assured we were set. Upon arriving at the ""deluxe"" room (slightly larger, slightly less mold - still subpar) I discovered the bags were not there. I called the front desk and politely explained the situation, and I was assured I would get a call back with the location of my bags and an ETA. Fifteen minutes go by with no call and no bags so I call back - no bags. Ten minutes later I call back - no bags. Finally at 4:35 (20 minutes after I was supposed to leave!) I call to say I will come get my bags myself if they tell me where they are and ask to speak to a manager. I am then told that not only can I not to pick up my bags, but there are no managers anywhere in the hotel who are available to help me, but if I leave me room number a manager will call me back in the evening. Ten minutes later (a full hour and forty five minutes after check in time) the bags finally arrive. A manager never contacted me or my husband.
The other members of our party staying at the Hudson experienced the following: 
- multiple power outages in multiple rooms during the stay
- air conditioners which broke down and were never fixed despite calls to the front desk
- broken lights in the bathroom
- no mirror in one of the rooms except for a pocket sized shaving mirror attached to the wall
- as a group of us walked down the disgusting hall we witnessed an unprofessional male staff member (an elusive manager perhaps?) screaming at the other staff members in front of guests
Even though every person I know who stayed at the Hudson received $100-$200 off because of the horrendous conditions, I would never recommend the Hudson Hotel to anyone. Save your money. Stay anywhere else!
One final note - the response by Hudson management to the many negative posts that they purposefully design the rooms to ""encourage"" guests not to want to spend any time in them is perhaps the most ludicrous thing I have ever heard. I honestly feel bad for the poor manager forced to rationalize the sorry, sorry state of the Hudson Hotel.",JBBChicago,2010-07-01,223023,2010-08-11,False,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

AVOID this place at all costs! Be aware that I am describing the room that is one step above the standard. I shudder at the thought of what the basic room might be like. Run far, far away from it. This hotel used to b a Fordham University dorm, and they have the audacity to charge upwards of $180 for a terribly uncomfortable stay inside of a drawer. This was the pits.

"“Tiny rooms with very poor air con” We stayed at the Hudson in January and were very disappointed. as regular visitors to NY we were expecting good things from this hotel and frankly we didn't see anything good. The rooms are tiny and I mean tiny. Yes, you wouldnt want to spend a lot of time in a hotel room in NYC but we did expect to be able to move freely around the room. The bathroom was dreadful and your knees touched the wall when you sat on the toilet (and I am very short - 5ft 2). Every night we were kept awake by the antiquated plumbing and air con system which clanked all night. The heating came on at random times and left the room boiling hot.

A selection of pseudo-trendy staff in black tee-shirted fashion statements is the approach.

"“Not for those who like luxury and home comforts” I stayed in a Queen Room for a few nights and these are my thoughts:
- This hotel is not for people who like their home comforts and space. I would say this hotel is best suited for those under 30 years old who are staying on their own. NOT SUITED for families or couples;
- The hotel is for TRENDY PEOPLE - if you are not trendy (like me) do not stay here as you will not appreciate the hotel. I found it a bit intimidating when I arrived very late in the night, extremely tired from my flight, looking terrible and being surrounded by club bunnies dressed to kill in very tight clothing!!!;
- I had a corner room which I understand is configured differently to the other rooms and slightly bigger, but the room was VERY SMALL. When you read other reviews that mention this - they are very correct;
- RECEPTION staff are nice although they are not so good at answering the phones;
- LOCATION IS SUPERB for all major tourist attractions - Central Park, Times Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue
- NO MINI BAR - only communal vending machines out in the corridors. Not convenient when you want a quick snack and have to get dressed properly to get it. Machines do not stock any alcohol if you like a nightcap I suggest you bring your own. Drinks at the Hudson are RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE (although served with a smile!)!!!
- SUGGEST you buy some bottle of water, snacks from the CVS Pharmacy which is very close by and store in your room;
- NO KETTLE - so no hot drinks unless you buy from outside or in the restaurant (Hudson Hall) downstairs. I suppose the lack of kettle would not bother really trendy people - but as I am not a trendy person and like to be able to get a very quick hot drink when I wake up in the morning, this was a small issue;
- I was lucky in that I had both a bath tub and a shower, but bathroom was very small. Two people could not use this at the same time;
- HOTEL NEEDS A GOOD RE-FRESH. The decor is looking a little old, the carpet in the corridors is frayed. The hotel could do with shutting down for a few months and having a total refurbishment, fresh paint, deep cleaning etc.;
- Corridors are DARK and SMELL TERRIBLE!;
- Walls are very thin - hopefully you won't get a frisky couple staying in the room next door like I did! Suggest you bring your own EAR PLUGS or see whether you can compete with the noise ;-)
- BREAKFAST - pricey and not a great selection, but freshly cooked. Chefs are very pleasant. Suggest you sample the many eateries outside though;
- IN SUMMARY - OK hotel, expensive for the small space you get, not for those who like space and comfort (and bed ruffles/valances), great location...",Cosmopolis,2010-07-01,223023,2010-08-05,False,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Designer Phillipe Starck imposes strict design rules!” This is the 2nd New York City hotel we've stayed in that was designed by the famous designer Phillipe Starck. If we had realized prior to booking that he had designed the hotel we would have chosen another. The strict design rules he imposes on hotel guests do not make the hotel more comfortable.
Rule #1. All lighting must be dim like you're in a nightclub
Everywhere you go at the Hudson the lights are dim. That's ok for the lobby or a bar, but why does the bathroom (when applying makeup), or the bedroom (when looking for something in your suitcase) or the restaurant (when you want to see your breakfast) have to be so poorly lit?
Rule #2. No counter space in the bathrooms
Our room had no counter space next to the pedestal sink. There was nowhere to lay out my cosmetics or my husband's shaving stuff. This is the same problem we had at the Paramount (also designed by Starck). This bathroom had small shelves over the toilet... but the likelihood that I'd knock something into the toilet didn't make it a good choice.
Bathroom Design solution: If you're staying at the Hudson, I suggest you call housekeeping and ask them to send up a small skinny desk (the same ones they have in the room). I had to call three times over 2 days to get the desk, but it totally solved the problem of no counter space in the bathroom. Plus it had a light on it -- and when I turned on the light -- voila! There was ample light for makeup and shaving. (See photo of bathroom with ""new"" desk idea!)
The staff were helpful but they admitted that the complaint of dim lighting was one they hear frequently. Apparently, the idea of having counter space around the sink is novel... 
Bottom line: The hotel could easily be upgraded to fix these design flaws but until they are, I would not stay at the Hudson again.",FLJ_designer,2010-08-01,223023,2010-08-25,False,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“small but well appointed” Great location and a cosy room with a great shower.
Impressive lobby and public spaces with a staff that were welcoming if not a bit harried seeming (when I checked in at 1 am, I had to wait for ten minutes, which wasn't ideal but they seemed very busy.)
The mattress in room 1466 could be a little less springy but I had a great night sleep every night but one when a private party kept the music in the lobby loud until midnight. When I called down to the front desk to check on why it was so noisy, they politely apologized but admitted that there was nothing they could do and I would just have to wait it out. Not great given I had to be at a business meeting at 7 am the next day.
Overall a great place to stay though worthe the price for the location and style.

"“Trendy, good value for NYC” In March, I used Priceline to find a hotel and it sent us to the Hudson. For $170 a night, we had a luxury NYC hotel room. Yes, it is quite small, as most NYC hotels are,but it was very clean and comfortable. 
Upon arrival to the hotel, there is no sign indicating that you are in the right place. There was a bellhop who informed us that yes, we were in the correct place and offered to take our bags. There was a bit of a wait in the lobby to check in, but it went quick and they were efficient in monitoring and helping. Check in was quick and easy and staff were pleasant.
The room was quite small, but very clean and visually appealing. The bathroom shower has a clear wall which is textured so you cannot see through and there is also a curtain that you can pull. The bathroom was quite tiny, but functional.
We slept very comfortably and had no issues with housekeeping. The bell hops helped us hail a cab in the morning. We did not require any service during our stay, nor did we use any of the hotel bars/restaurants, but it seemed like people were always hanging out and having fun in the restraurant and bar, but were not disruptive.

"“Met our expectations” The Hudson hotel is a very cool and busy hotel, with 'socialising' the main focal point - 1 skybar, 1 terrace bar and a popular nightclub in the lobby. We had a good experience at this hotel, contrary to most the reviews on this site. Staff were very helpful, Sabrina in reception very friendly and even provided us with a complementary bottle of champagne for my girlfriends birthday - thank you!! - and the concierge happy to help for even the smallest reasons. The rooms were small, we were in a double-queen size (10th floor) which had enough room for the amount of time we spent in there - however the bathroom was small and anyone over 6 foot my have had trouble using the toilet (seated) as it was directly opposite the dividing wall!! But, unlike some reviews, our air con was along the side wall, had two very large mirrors on each wall and a wall mounted flat screen tv. Rooms cleaned to a good standard with fresh towels daily and we were not bothered by housekeeping staff like in some hotels. I agree the bar is very pricey - $28 (£20) for two cocktails which were mediocre, but you are paying for the surroundings and very cool (scantily clad), and friendly staff. Hotel situated very well for both local amenities and the major attractions, Times Square about 10 minutes walk. its worth noting at this point that there are some very good local restaurants, Bistro 56 for excellent homemade pasta and Cognac for amazing steak and atmosphere. We never ate at the hotel so cannot comment on the facility. The pictures on the Hudson hotel website do the hotel justice and are a good reflection of the facilities.

"“Loved the Hudson despite the teeny tiny room” Yes, the rooms are teeny tiny. I would not recommend a standard room for more than one person. However the rooms do make excellent use of the space, the bathroom is well designed, and there is space to hang clothes and store luggage. My only problem with the miniature room was the miniature TV - I would have liked a larger flatscreen TV.
I asked for a room on one of the top floors, and as such it got lots of natural light which probably made it a bit more comfortable. My room also had a 'glimpse' of the Hudson River from the window, which was nice. 
The lobby is spectatcular, and the breakfast included in my room rate was delicious. The lobby bar was a great place for a drink, although typically pricey. The Library was also a great space to relax if you feel a little too claustraphobic in the room, and I was even able to eavesdrop in on a few celebrity interviews taking place there during my stay.
Location was excellent, close to the subway and Central Park. The Whole Foods just across the street at Columbus Circle is great for picking up fresh food.

We supposedly got an upgrade to a superior room, although it was so tiny I don't know how any room could be smaller than that. But it looked ok, if a bit weird. The beds are low and not that big, but adequate. 
Then the problems started: firstly, the heating didnt work unless you turned it up to 90 degrees, and then it was too hot! It also made a terrible banging noise all night, so I had to wear earplugs. Also, the water never got that hot unless you showered first thing in the morning. And the worst thing was the toilet was not stuck down to the floor, so it banged back down every time you stood up!

The rooms however are really small, I felt like I was on a cruise ship in one of those cabin rooms. The desk was something my 6 year old nephew would sit at.

"“Loved the Hudson, great place to stay in NY!” My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hudson in January and we both found it to be a great hotel. We had read several reviews referring to small cramped rooms and unfriendly staff, but found this simply not to be the case.
Yes the rooms are small but how much time are you spending in your hotel room while in New york?!! We upgraded the room to a superior and had more than enough room to put our luggage and shopping. I am over 6ft and didn't find the rooms to be that much trouble. The coridoors are dark, but consistent with the rest of the hotel and we did not find them 'dangerous' or 'ridiculous' as previous people have referred to them as.
As for the staff, checking in and out was seamless and they were more than happy to help us out at any time, even booking us restaurant reservations and giving out some valuable tourist information.
If you're looking for a cool hotel located right next to the park and within easy reach of Times Square and 5th Avenue, then this is the place. The older generation might struggle to get to grips with the low lights and funky bars, but then again, it wasn't designed for the over 50's... no offence!!
All in all, its a great place to spend a few days in NYC, while the bars and restaurants in the hotel may be pricey as you'd probably expect it to be ($9 for a bottle of Corona....hmmmmm!!) Its just as easy to pick out some nice restaurants and bars locally and breakfast round the corner in Flames was a great place to go in the mornings.

"“Underwhelming Hotel” Whenever I go to NYC I try to stay at a different hotel. And there is something I like about Morgan's Hotel Group hotels. My impressions usually run from OK to great. But I found the Hudson underwhelming.
As with many Morgan's the lobby is a kick. It has the feel of a brick warehouse, with ivy growing all over the ceiling. It's dark, but that's typical. There is loud music playing all day and night. Having a greeter was a nice touch, though she didn't do much but say hello and welcome.
Front desk staff was really pleasant and helpful. 
My room was about the size of a decent walk-in closet. I could barely move around the bed, the workspace just held my laptop. And the dark paneling made it feel even smaller.
The bathroom was proportionately small. I could barely move around in it. The water never really got hot, the sink never really shut off. The only nice feature was a big window between the shower and the room so I could watch ESPN while getting clean. 
The dining space is intersting - same brick as the lobby with long community tables. The food was so-so, and definitely not worth the $30 I paid for the buffet. 
I was impressed with their gym, which had 3 treadmills and other cardio equipment each with their own TV, and plenty of weight equipment. And it was a big space so it never felt crowded.
Location is fine, about 2 blocks from Columbus Circle. And you can't really beat the low room price. But there are much better hotels in NYC, and certainly better Morgan's hotels.",Spamstan,2009-01-01,223023,2009-01-19,False,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“WOW! would go back tomorrow” I was a bit worried at first knowing that the rooms were quite small, but when i got there they were bigger than i thought! All you need room for is to sleep, store your clothes and to have a shower. The bathroom was a good size and so was the bedroom for that matter, plenty of room. The shower was great! Lovely compfy bed with clean fresh sheets daily and a big flat screen tv etc. The staff and hotel was first class. We were given breakfast vouchers which came in really handy. The location could not have been better, on one side was central park and the other time square. The Hudson bar was fantastic, very busy and popular with a great atmostphere. Very very stylish! Although it was freezing in NYC that time of year, we were lovely and warm in the hotel. We will be going back to the hudson hotel in the summer for sure next time to experience the amazing sky terrace.

"“small rooms, great location” The reviews of Hudson Hotel you find on Tripavisor are basically correct: rooms are small, hotel design is not such a big thing, good location (expecially if you ride the Subway) is absolutely the ""plus"".
My wife and I needed a clean double room and Hudson satisfied our request. We hoped the rooms were bigger than it seemed from the user pictures... and they were not! (actually New York hotel rooms aren't quite ""large"", Hudson was in average, after all).
The hotel designer is Philip Starck and his best things are the bar and the lobby (not the rooms). If you like ""Gossip Girl"" you'll be happy to know that a few scenes were shot at Hudson. Is that enough for their room price? You decide.
The staff. They were kind, but somehow they lost our luggage after the check out: we spent 1/2 hour waiting for them to find it. But I still believe it was just a mistake, and mistakes happen. So, don't worry too much about the staff.
Three years ago I spent my ""New York days"" at the Fitzpatricks (on Lexington): it was a smaller hotel, less glossy, and with larger rooms...

"“Now I Know How a Sardine Feels” My son & I stayed at the Hudson for three nights in early January. The room was booked through Priceline at $115/night + fees. A fairly reasonable rate for a well located NYC hotel. Upon arrival, we did upgrade the room for $90/night in order to have more space and two double beds. The base room is approximately 136 Sq.Ft. with one double bed--very very small. In addition, you must live out of your suitcase because there is no furniture with drawers to store your clothes. These are rooms you will never lounge in--you sleep, bathe & get out.

"“Great location but it has its problems...” This hotel is striking when you walk in and you can tell the people at reception know that!!! The lighting is slightly annoying but makes it look cool so thats fine. The location is really fantastic, you cannot get lost and can easily walk to all the main shopping/eating places (the subway is also across the road). The room was very small but to be honest it didnt bother us as much as other people on here. There were a couple of issues with the bathroom plumbing which were sorted out fairly quickly but the really big issue was the noise - we had to wear ear plugs until around 4am for quite a few nights because of the club downstairs. We ate at the hotel cafeteria one night which has a great feel to it but was not worth the expense when there are so many restaurants in New York (around £130 for 2 courses and 2 drinks!!). Overall, our trip to New York was so great that we put up with some of the issues but we wouldnt stay there again. ps. i have also found out today that they have just added a random charge of about £30 to my bill a few days after we checked out for no apparent reason....apparently they are famous for this.",BeckyC8888,2008-12-01,223023,2009-01-03,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hudson Hotel - Better than Expected!” I have traveled to many places and seen many hotel rooms but nothing as unusual as this. This is a good thing since NYC can be hectic, especially around New Years Eve when I stayed. I decided to stay at the hotel at the recommendation of a colleague who used to stay at the Hudson while traveling to NYC. I was not disappointed upon arrival but admit was a tad apprehensive after reading the negative reviews on TripAdvisor.
First off, the hotel is on 58th Street just behind the Time Warner Center off Columbus Circle. Columbus Circle's subway stop is convenient to have since it is only a few stops northward from Penn Station or Times Square on the 1, A, or C subway lines However, be on the look out for a fluorescent yellow doorway while walking on 58th Street since the hotel is unmarked. 
Second, the hotel lobby looks like something of a rainforest complete with wooden furniture and ivy. You will enjoy the bright yellow escalator getting there since it feels like a futuristic voyage. The hotel staff checking in was most accommodating despite the large crowds. I arrived at the hotel early and they got me a room within 30 minutes which was completely understandable given the chaos of New Years. The bellhops were also courteous in asking if I needed help with luggage but I declined since I only had an overnight bag with me. Even the maitre d' offered to help with luggage, something not usually seen. 
Third, comes the subject of getting to the room and the room itself. Yes, as other reviewers noted, the hallways are a bit dark, but it feels like a crypt in a fun, eerie sort of way. Again, this adds to the ambience. The room is small but it is NYC after all. The lights had a very cool modern design, comfortable furniture, and plush bathroom amenities. It felt like being in a cruise ship room except without being seasick.
Fourth, the restaurants are a tad expensive in the Hudson but are worth the money. If you like less expensive options then walk outside the hotel onto 9th Avenue and you will see a Europa Cafe and the Flame Diner. CVS, Starbucks, and a supermarket are on 9th Avenue a half block north of the hotel for convenience. Tip: Buy bottled water at CVS or the supermarket instead of using the one ""conveniently"" placed in the room.
Fifth, the Library and Hudson Bars are great places to have drinks with a good mix of young and old patrons. For a quieter time, check out the Library Bar and cozy up with a book or a game of pool. Note: The Hudson Bar gets VERY crowded around 7:30 P.M. or so.
Sixth, checkout was a breeze. The Hudson even offered to store luggage for you for a nominal charge despite checking out while you explore the town and catch some last minute sights. This beats having to lug baggage around.
In summary, the Hudson will see a repeat visit from me. The hotel truly felt like a getaway from the grind that is NYC. I did not get to the awesome rooftop lounge since it is closed in the winter but look to revisit in the warmer months. 
(Extra Tip: Take the C subway line to Fulton Street, then walk 1 block west to Church Street, turn left onto Church and walk about a block south to reach the Century 21 department store downtown. The store has good deals on designer clothes if you know your brands and prices but shop early to avoid the crowds of tourists. Recall that the C subway line stops at Columbus Circle.)",Generalang,2008-12-01,223023,2009-01-02,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great Hotel, great Location and staff” We really enjoyed our stay at the Hudson Hotel. 
Before arriving we were afraid that the rooms would be to small but they were just fine. The room was at the 19th floor with a fantastic view and almost no noise from below.
Our bathroom was seperated from the actually room through a door and we had enough space for three big bags.
A plus was the flatscreen TV.
The staff was great too. Fast check in/out, quick reservations and always helpfull.
The location of the Hudson is a big plus. 2 min. away from the Central Park, Subway and Colmbus Circle.
I would book the Hudson with out a second thougt and can highly recommend it.",Closedeyes,2008-12-01,223023,2009-01-02,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“A bit lost in a great location” I spent 4 days in NYC for New Year's and booked this hotel at the very last minute through Priceline, for about €230 a night. 
I had a quick read through Tripadvisor before setting off, and this is probably the most accurately commented hotel of any of those I've stayed in.
The location of the hotel is excellent, more or less on Central Park, and only 100m from the Columbus Circle subway, which is on the vital red line. You're never far from anything when staying here.
And the unusual style of the hotel is quite nice too. The lobby is very impressive, and the low-lighting throughout does add a certain ambience that you don't normally get in hotels. It does feel like you're in a member's club rather than a hotel. Heating was at full tilt, and seeing as we were in minus temperatures outside, it was always nice to step inside.
Check in was very straightforward. 
The rooms are tiny. If anything over the bare minimum required by a traveller is provided, we're talking about in inches rather than feet. Don't let this put you off though - apart from the lack of a bath, there isn't anything you can't do in one of these rooms that you might do in a suite. 
So all in all, that's quite good so far, and given the price for the time of year, I really wouldn't complain.
Instead, I'd recommend. 
People staying in the hotel over the week seemed almost all to fall in the economy to mid-range traveller brackets. And I'd imagine that most of these folks took one look at the price list and never spent a single cent on the premises. 
I risked a bottle of beer one evening and got stung for $9. Which, like everything in the hotel, just isn't worth it.
And due to the way the hotel is arranged, it is possible to enter and exit your room without crossing the lobby or encountering a member of staff. 
So with residents not spending any money, and residents not meeting or even visiting the communal areas, there is no hotel experience here for most guests. It's just a well-positioned, small room in New York.
Why a hotel would take this strategy is beyond me. There is a potential four-figure audience for facilities staying each night, but they're all down the road in Starbucks, or another eatery.
The premium they're earning on each item is surely dwarfed by the earnings they're losing by outpricing their core audience.",AnthonyMcNamee,2008-12-01,223023,2009-01-02,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great Location, Room Small, but hey its NEW YORK!” When I found out I was staying at this hotel, I knew what I was getting into based on the review here. I was happy that I took a taxi. I'm sure I would still be looking for it, since the hotel has no marquee or sign of any kind. You just have to ""know"" its there.
PRO and CON of the hotel.....
Pro: 
* Great Location... close to the Columbus subway station, a Starbucks, Central Park (and Tavern on the Green!), to the Lincoln Center and a great Whole Foods market!! (The soup at Whole Food sure hit the spot on a cold day, and the price is downright cheap!)
* The subway has the route which took us directly to JFK/ AirTrain. 
* Clean Room, Large bath, Central AC, great Shampoo and soap! (but see the con)
* Nice staff. I requested a quiet room, and got what I wanted. The conceirge printed my Delta boarding pass for me... free of charge. Very courteous, dispite the chaos around them.
Con:
* The interior of the hotel is very dark. Perfect for vampires, but if you want bright and cheery, this is not for you! 
* Small room: I was in room 1601 which was very basic, and I was glad I packed light. The room had a ""closet"" with 8 hangers, a double bed, and a fair size bathroom. I think the bathroom was the same size as my sleeping quarter. NO drawers, so I ended up living out of my suitcase. 
* Thin walls. My neighbor dropped a coin or something metal on his floor and I could have sworn he was in my room!
* Not the best lighting in the room. Like the lobby, the light is geared for vampires. If you turn on all the light in the room, it'll get real hot. Lucky you have central AC
* Expensive if you eat there... but hey, you're in NYC and there's so much to do outside the hotel. (We found a great Italian place called Manga e Bevi on Ninth Avenue and 53rd Street. Reasonable and FUN!)
* Hard to find if you don't know what to look for.
Overall I give it 4 out of 5 stars. I'd stay there again if it were just me and my spouse. New York has so much to see and do, why bother staying in side the hotel??

"“Bring a Sense of Humor” Read the reviews. All true. The good: Great location right at Lincoln Center. Asked for and was cheerfully given an upgrade. Had a king room with two windows. Lobby has hip vibe. The not-so-good: Our upgraded room had about 2 feet on either side of the bed and about 1 foot to clear the end of the bed. Can't imagine what the original room looked like. I'm 5' tall and my knees touched the wall when using the loo. Absolutely no room for anything. You better be very good friends with your roommate as you can lay in bed and watch them showering and doing all their bathroom chores through the glass wall and sheer curtain.

"“Liar, Liar pants on fire!!!” We booked our room at the Hudson Hotel using Priceline and were able to get a really big discount off of the price posted on their website. The lobby was very hip, however, a little on the dark side. Our room was adequate, although as mentioned by previous reviewers, a little on the small side. We did have room to put a suitcase on each side of the bed and still had room to move around. Overall, our stay was enjoyable, until check-out. On the morning of our departure, we found a bill under our door outlining incidental charges for our stay. As we had pre-paid with Priceline, we were not expecting any additional charges. We were very surprised to find that we had been billed for 3 pay-per-view movies @ 18.95 each and an item from the mini-bar @ 7.50. We did not watch any movies or take anything from the mini-bar. The staff at the front desk was not helpful at all and said that their system was accurate and that we would have to pay those charges. We asked to speak to a manager and were told that the manager would tell us the same thing. We were rather surprised that they would be so inflexible in dealing with our problem. The manager did finally come over to assist with our problem. We asked which movies we had supposedly watched and what time we had watched them. We also asked what item we supposedly had taken from the mini-bar. We offered to present them with receipts from restaurants, ticket stubs from shows, and subway receipts as proof that we were not in our room very much during our stay. We were told that they had no way of pulling up movie titles or times, only that we had watched 3 movies. The manager did finally agree to remove 2 of the movie charges and the mini-bar item, but still insisted on charging us for the third movie. What horrible customer service!!! He acted like he was doing us a huge favor by removing the charges. Instead, it was obvious that he didn't believe us. I have had incorrect charges on hotel bills in the past, but in all of my other experiences the charges were removed without question. Needless to say, this experience completely ruined our impression of this hotel.

"“A waste of money - I ended up with a black eye the room was so small” We booked this hotel for a weekend break in New York. When I arrived the doorman was very friendly and efficient, I was very impressed. Sadly that was the best experience I had at the hotel. 
I arrived at the check in desk alone, my partner was arriving an hour after me. They asked for a credit card, I didn't have one but said my partner would be along in one hour to check in and that they could have the card details then. I was told I couldn't check in until I had a credit card or a $150 deposit. I was very tiered after a long trip and very angry at being treated like I'd empty the mini bar and do a runner in one hour. We had just paid £1200 for a 4 night stay, I was not impressed.
I finally managed to check in leaving a $100 deposit (all I had on me) and arrived at my room. On the Hudson website it says styled on cabins from an old fashioned yacht, they forgot to mention the room was the size of a cabin on a yacht, tiny. I ended up with a black eye after getting out of bed and smacking my eye on the TV on the wall as it was so close to the bed!
Next the bathroom, absolutely tiny, I'm only 5ft tall and quite small. Sitting on the loo my knees nearly touched the wall in front. The shower head in the shower was absolutely black with scum (looked like it had never been cleaned) and the base of the bath had worn away to reveal the concrete underneath the enamel. There were hairs all up the walls and around the bath too.
As for dusting and cleaning, I don't think the room had been cleaned for at least a couple of weeks there was thick dust everywhere and marks on the sides where other guests had spilt drinks etc.
The Hudson does have a couple of good points. The bar is very trendy although very pricey, 2 glasses of champagne each nearly £100. Breakfast at the hotel is very good, although the canteen is so dark you can hardly see what you're eating.

"“Kind of Nice, Wouldn't Stay Again” This boutique hotel we stayed at for 2 nights, and it was a Priceline booking. 
The good: Location, modern decor, friendly staff
The bad: Street sounds very noisy, mattress could have been softer, room extremely small.
This is not a room you want to stay in and lounge around, as there is just enough room for a bathroom, one suitcase, and the bed. The TV is a flatscreen that hangs on the wall, and there is a little table- that is about it. The worst thing was the street noise. They need to upgrade the windows to make the room quieter, because I awoke several times in the night due to car alarms and honking, and we were on the 14th floor. 
The location was great. We walked to the MOMA, the public library, Bryant Park, Times Square, and were just steps away from Central Park. I would not stay again however, because of the tight quarters and noisy street sounds that filtered in easily.",sparklesque,2008-12-01,223023,2008-12-08,False,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great Hotel, Very friendly” We recently stayed at the Hudson for 5 nights and loved it! Ok so the rooms aren't huge but having read the reviews I expected them to be tiny but the room was more than comfortable for the two of us with plenty of hanging space for clothes etc. The bathroom is small but I've seen smaller! This is New York after all and we were only in the hotel to sleep and change clothes!
As for the staff being unfriendly I couldn't disagree more - in our experience receptionists were all helpful & friendly, doormen always said good morning and welcome back when we returned.
We were there for thanksgiving so asked for and got lots of advice from reception about where to go etc and (I say again!) they couldn't have been more helpful.
We had a night flight home and asked for a late check out - TOP TIP! they will extend your check out time to 2pm at no extra cost but after that you have to pay half a day's rate so we opted for the 2pm check out & left the bags with the doormen after that.
We were on the 19th floor so can't comment about noise from the bars etc so my only suggestion re the rooms is to ask for a rear facing room as ours was over the street and (this being New York and all) it was quite noisy but did quieten off later, we just got some earplugs!
For breakfast we went to the place on the corner of the same block for the first day but would absolutely recommend crossing over to the one opposite called 'Flame' - much better value, service and comfort!",deedee15,2008-11-01,223023,2008-12-06,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great for a Night on the Town” Stayed at the Hudson Hotel to enjoy a night in New York City. Great location for any event in Midtown, close to Columbus Circle subway station with quick connection to Grand Central Terminal. 
I stayed in the smallest room. The area was very small, but the cleanliness of every thing was worth it. I am a tall man and I found the bed to be comfortable.

"“An excellent hotel” If there is one thing that should make you visit this hotel it is the rooftop garden! Sipping cocktails whilst watching the sunset over Manhatten was a wonderful beginning and ending to a fantastic holiday. From the moment that we walked into the hotel we were impressed with the facilities and staff who could not have been more helpful. 
The location on upper west side was fantastic for seeing the city - the nearest subway was at the end of the block accompanied by a shopping mall with some excellent shops. 
The rooms although very compact were very clean, modern and had their own stereo. The restaurant was excellent in a cafeteria style where you could watch your food being cooked. I really could not recommend the hotel high enough - having stayed at other hotels in new york this hotel won hands down as a great base for seeing new york.",citytraveller23,2008-08-01,223023,2008-11-29,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Yes Small Rooms, But Nice Hotel” I had read the reviews and looked at the pictures on the internet so I had a good idea what we were getting into. We had also been to the bar on a previous visit so we knew how to find the hotel. (Hint - Look for the flame and the bushes)
The room is small and about the smallest I have stayed in NYC. But we only paid $179 and we were staying for only one night. With those parameters, it was just fine. I would also say that based on some of the reviews I would have thought the property was run down, but not at all. The room was well appointed and the amenities were fine.
I would check out the hotel's website and look at one of the rooms, before you book. It gives you a great idea of what they have. My only real complaint was that the beds were low to the floor and to get in and out over the course of the night was a pain (I'm getting old).",TPXB,2008-11-01,223023,2008-11-26,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great time in NYC at the Hudson” We booked for 4 nights at the Hudson through Priceline and were sceptical due to lots of negative reviews on this site. 
However, don't be put off by these - we had a good time at the hotel. Yes, the rooms are on the compact side - but they were spotless (cleaned daily) and so well designed that it never felt too cramped. There was plenty of space for 2 adults, 2 large suitcases and plenty of shopping. Shower was hot and had a variety of power settings.
The lobby is a bit TOO dark, but check in was speedy and efficent.
Drinks and food were expensive at the hotel (both in the bars and room service/minibar) but there are plenty of reasonably priced diners nearby.
Location superb - just round the corner from Central Park and a 2 minute walk from Columbus Circle Subway with easy access to all the sights.

"“Mediocre stay, bad service” The hotel is very eclectic and fun, but there are some issues. First if you don't know where it is, you will never find it. There are no signs. The only thing you see is a yellow light coming out of the door...that is it. The bar is fun and amazing. Lots of pretty people. The hotel rooms leave a lot to be desired. Small in size and need renovations. Not as clean as I thought. Amenities are ok. Valet parking for 1 hour is $55 and drinks are regular NY price at $15.00 a pop. Staff is rude, not accomodating and slow. Food was not good, yet very expensive. At $500 a night for a rather small room with no view, you would think the staff would be nicer.

"“Okay, the rooms are small - but the location is ace” If you've read any of the other reviews of the Hudson on this site, the one thing you'll know is that the rooms are small. Very small.
If you trawl around on here, someone has posted a video which shows you how small. In short though, the bedroom, is a double bed with maybe a foot or two around three sides of it, and the bathroom is nudged up against that, maybe four foot by two-and-a half.
But come on; it's New York. Unless you're willing to pay a fortune, rooms are going to be tiny.
My girlfriend and I stayed here for five nights in mid November and paid about $300 per night (including taxes) and actually, the size of the room was never a problem.
And on the plus side for the room, it was quiet once you got in, the bed was really comfy, the heating was good for those cold New York nights, and when you wanted a bit of fresh air you could throw the window open and suck in that 58th Street air. 
Elsewhere, the hotel was great. The library bar was very cool, and worth a visit for a cocktail (although the prices will probably mean that's a treat rather than a regular occurrence), and the chandelier over the check-in desk with holographic light bulbs is worth a closer look. 
But the best thing about this place is its location. Right there on Columbus Circle with its three (or four - I forget) subway lines running through. 
If you're going to stay here, shell out $25 for a week's subway pass and travel everywhere on the tube. You'll save yourself a fortune on taxi fares or shoe leather, and you can get practically everywhere on Manhattan with a ten minute train ride and a ten minute walk.",LondonSteveH,2008-11-01,223023,2008-11-23,False,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Fashionable, Great Location, Compact Rooms...” I'll bullet point my thoughts rather than write a novel:
1. The Hudson is very trendy - checking in late on Friday night is like checking into a nightclub (dark, trendy people everywhere and loud music)... not that that is a bad thing just different!
2. The 15th floor roof terrace is lovely and you dont feel obliged to buy anything - can just lie in the sunshine
3. Bedrooms are very very small and not very bright however the beds are very comfortable, the shower great and the rooms are cleverly done to maximise the space available. We had a queen room which was fine - to be honest on a city break you are just sleeping there not hanging around all day.
4. Service was great - everyone from reception to concierge and cleaners were friendly.
5. The hotel is very relaxed about you bringing in your own food - something UK hotels hate... there are often people in the lifts with pizza and beers etc. (much cheaper than buying in-house)
6. Location is fantastic - a couple of great diners very close by for breakfast - try Route 66. You can also walk to central park / rockerfeller centre / time square etc. Tube also nearby. Most cabbies know where the hotel is (even though it doesnt look like a hotel and has no signage outside) but remember the address cos one cabbie had no idea.
Overall the downsides are the size of the rooms and the dark corridors but its a very cool hotel perfect for a city break - think you have to be young at heart though we saw a couple of older people who looked a little perplexed & its definitely not the place for little kids even though we saw some there.",Blondieboots,2008-10-01,223023,2008-10-18,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Not sure” I stayed at the Hudson with my friend on a 4 night girly trip to NYC.
Fabulously tendy yes, but not really that much else to recommend it.
We paid around £150/night for a Deluxe (bigger than standard) through Expedia, but upgraded to a double double room for an additional $60 as there were no twin bedded rooms available. This room was a pretty good size, with 2 queen sized beds, and seems to be a world apart from standard rooms. 
There's just about enough hanging space (open rail by the door) but not enough hangers, no drawers, and a space to put suitcase & shopping.
Lovely crisp cotton bedding with feather pillows & duvet, but I requested a change as I am allergic & it didn't actually happen until the 2nd day. 
Obviously very stylish decor and a decent flat screen TV (again, better than in a standard room).
The bathroom was an OK size too (another benefit of the larger room) and didn't have the glass partition but instead a real solid wall and door. Top tip - the hairdryer is hung on the back of the bathroom door! 
Lots of trendy and luxurious accessories, but beware of the cost - the scented candles are not complimentary! No minibar but some extortionately-priced snacks and soft drinks.
Although stylish, the rooms are really only the standard of an average Travelodge and are starting to need refurbishment.
As others have commented, public areas are incredibly dark and actually quite depressing, especially the corridors.
Rooftop terrace and outside bar are both quite lovely, and the former has the advantage of being for residents only.
Elsewhere, in the garden bar and main bar, there is absolutely no preferential treatment for hotel residents - willingness to commit to bottle service appears to be the only way of securing a table, and at $300 for a bottle of vodka! This is probably the element that made me quite dislike the Hudson. At the weekend the bar is packed, with a velevet rope entry policy. In the garden bar, there was no chance of a table and we had to queue up for $18 drinks. On a quiet Monday, we were 'allowed' a table in the bar but only a small one and could not have a decent table for our party of 5 (even though the place was empty) because we did not want to purchase a bottle of spirits or champagne.
Overall, OK but only 3* standard and with an approach to customer service that is beyond pretentious!",Hamish11,2008-08-01,223023,2008-10-17,False,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“It's a scam” We booked this hotel through Priceline. After reading reviews we were a little disappointed. The rooms are extreamely small, but read in other reviews that we can upgrade to a larger room for $30 extra per night. (Staff origianally asked for $60 but then negotiated to $30). My sister and I checked in and we were assigned a queen bed, entire hotel room is 150 sq. ft. We asked for an upgrade. They gave us a room with a king bed, 230 sq. ft, for an additional $60 per night and were told that if we had booked directly with the hotel we would have paid less than through Priceline. I felt that we were being scammed. We checked in and the room is especially compact. This was unacceptable. We returned to the front desk and were told by another staffer that it would have been chepaer booking direct. We asked to speak to the manager and he said if we were not happy he would cancel our reservation. We took him up on his offer.

"“Dreadful” Stayed here for 3 nights and it was the worst experience I have had in NYC! Our hotel room was not ready, and there were no more non-smoking rooms left when we checked in. The hotel did not try to offer any viable solutions for us--just ""sorry, check back with us tomorrow""). The hotel tries too hard to be trendy and hip. It is nothing more than a big noisy nightclub with thumping techno music 24 hours a day! The walls are paper-thin and you can hear everything going on in the surrounding rooms and hallways (and the hotel seems to be booked mostly by 20 year olds, so fill-in-the-blank about the types of noise you will hear at all hours of the night). The street noise is also very loud, as well as the music from the club/bars in the hotel. The rooms are not built for comfort, and there is just one tiny electric heater/AC unit on the wall (the the unit is also NOISY). The drinks at the bar are $16 each (am I being cheap? Is that the going rate for a drink?). The highlight of the hotel is that it is located diagonal from the Columbus Circle subway stop.

"“Great Design, But You Can't Sleep in the Lobby” As a design student, I've heard rave reviews about the Hudson. The public spaces are amazing and I recommend a visit to the bars and outside spaces. However, I would not recommend staying there. I travel to NYC quite often, and travel tons for work. This is the smallest room I have ever seen in the city, and frankly, my room on my last cruise was bigger; for example, you have to negotiate the toilet bowl to climb into the shower--beware handicapped travelers! About our average stay: 1) the staff greeted us with a smoking room, and made it clear we were ""less than"" because we booked on Priceline (for what turned out to be full price), 2) our room was not serviced by housekeeping (we had to call daily), 3) the bathroom pocket-door didn't work (causing a bit more intimacy than we wanted) - we called the desk 3 times for the bathroom only to be told that engineering was ""on its way."" -- engineering never showed.",patroclus_dc,2008-10-01,223023,2008-10-13,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“The worst hotel I have ever stayed in for £120 a night” NO HEATING - aparently they only put the heating on when it reaches 45F. We had to sit in blankets in the room!
DARK DINGY CORRIDORS - yes they maybe trendy for under 25's. If you are over 40 or have kids, DONT STAY HERE.
Corridors look like a prison.
ROOMS - PRISON CELL SIZE. I HAVE BEEN TO YOUTH HOSTELS THAT ARE WARMER AND LARGER. 
NO CURTAINS - so you cant keep the cold out.
NO TEA/COFFEE.
IT'S A CONVERTED GOVERNMENT APARTMENT BUILDING AND IT SHOWS (THATS WHY THEY CANT PUT THE HEATING ON)
We checked out after one day. It was that bad. Book the Park Central around the corner. It is wamer, larger and cheaper.
All you are paying for at the Hudson is some 'trendy' paint and gloomy 'hip' lighting.
We also stayed in the Club Quarters at the Rockfeller centre. It was pure luxary compared to this dump, I am 45 and went with one child.

Only one big disappointment is the main bar turns into a club in the evening, every night!! After dinner the hotel lobby was crowded and music was really loud.

"“Great hotel if you find a deal” My husband and I stayed for 5 nights at the Hudson Hotel in April while doing the tourist thing in NYC. We were apprehensive before arriving after reading some of the not-so-great reviews of this hotel, but we really enjoyed our stay. We would definitely return, but not at full sticker price. 
Here are a few things to consider before booking your stay: Yes, it’s true. The rooms are tiny, but they are very efficiently laid-out. The room is also dim due to low lighting, dark wood paneling and a small outside window, but the clear glass pane between the bright (but tiny) bathroom and bedroom helps to lighten up the room. Yes, it’s also true that the hallways are dark too, but it was never a problem for us. There’s is a trendy bar in the lobby that’s hopping on the weekend, so make sure that you request a higher up room if you’re worried about noise. BTW - I was impressed that hotel security checked to make sure that only guests were riding the elevators at night. Check-in was efficient, and the reception staff were friendly - they upgraded us to a larger room after the first night (but to tell you the truth it was hard to tell the difference, it was so small too!) The concierge was really helpful, and even got us into a restaurant (Babbo) that I’d tried booking a month ahead of our arrival but couldn’t get a table. The doorman safely stored our luggage after checking-out so we could still spend our last day exploring NYC baggage-free. Above all else, the location was absolutely terrific – close to Central Park, only a 10 min. walk from Time Square, and 2 blocks from the subway. However, it’s true that there is no sign outside the Hudson, so be sure to look at pictures of the hotel exterior before arriving so that you can find it easily. With all that said, would we stay here again and recommend this hotel to you? Yes, if you’re okay with the above, and find a deal for $200 a night or better.",shnoop,2008-04-01,223023,2008-10-01,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Like a Hobbit Jail Cell” Great location, the smallest room/bathroom you've ever seen.
- Don’t expect to work in your room. The table is hobbit sized; I could barely get my laptop and the mouse on it and there was nowhere to put the overpriced bottles of water that were on the table. 
- Don’t expect to kick back and relax watching TV – seriously, my IPhone has a larger screen than the TV in the room…and more channels! 
- Don’t expect to stretch out in the room. I’m pretty tall and I swear I could have touched both walls, the floor and ceiling simultaneously! 
- Don’t expect to have a relaxing experience whilst performing your ablutions; the bathroom is so small that your knees touch the wall when you sit and think! Really, the bathroom was probably 4 feet wide! 
- Don’t expect to be able to find the entrance without a spirit guide, the entranceway is better hidden than the entrance to the ministry of magic in the Harry Potter Movies - I complained when I eventually found the hotel that there is no name or number on the outside, the receptionist told me it was part of the character of the hotel. I told her that it was bloody foolish given that most guests were not psychic. 
- Don’t bring children in to the entrance area – it is so dark you could easily kill a small child with your rolling luggage and not even know about it. If you take small children with you I’d recommend a flashing beacon on their hats or a flashlight just to be careful. I know they think that this is cool but it really just makes the place feel dingy.
Don't get me wrong, if you can get a room here for a good price then it is fine – the location is great and the room was clean enough.

The rooms were very small but hey, it's NYC. The actual grounds on the hotel was wonderful. The sky terrace on the 15th floor was right out of a Restoration Hardware catelog. I took a great nap in the hammock. The drinks were very expensive but worth the $20 to sip champagne in the lounge and feel like a star. The hallways were dimly lite and it was hard to see at times. But overall, the hotel was so cool and chic. I cna't wait to go back. The rooms are more on the romantic side than 2 girl friends staying the weekend but we didn't care.

*Location~Right near central park and accross the street from the Time Warner Building..
*Lobby~ Very unique, as you can see from the pictures
*Roof Top Bar~Great atmosphere, comfy charis, couches, etc to lounge on
Cons:
*Rooms~ Literally the size of a tiny boat cabin. Uncomfortable bed, The side glass wall of the shower is open up to the bed, so if you adventurous, just open the curtain and give him a show. 
*Boderline Obnoxious staff, not very helpful and a lot of cat-calling(except the bar tender in the library~he was great, talkative, and helpful)
*Lighting~The lighting in the lobby is great. But in the hallways to the guestrooms...really? Honestly felt I was walking the halls of a seedy apartment, expecting a crack addict to pop out of the corner and jump me...

No notice when booking or on the website. 2) Promises a ""newspaper of choice upon request"" on the website. I requested a USA Today at check-in, but they did not deliver or have one in the morning at the front desk. 3) The size of the room is very small (take a 2-car garage and make 4 quadrants. Walk into 1 of thos quadrants - that's your space). The bed does not have a box spring, so it's very close to the floor. 5) The hallways are very dark, dull and a little scary when someone else passes you in the Hallway. 4) I paid $375 per night for 2 nights and later found out via hotels.com that I could have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria for the same price.

"“Hip maybe, enjoyable no” The staff is friendly and efficient. The standard room is very small, even by New York standard. The safe is placed on the floor, which makes it uncomfortable to use it. The best part is the transparent glass window between room and bathroom, which enabled me to watch my wife having a shower. They pretend to be ecological conscious so they dim the light in the hallway to almost darkness which is neutralized by the noise of the soundamplifier in the bar. 30$ for glass of wine and a beer is hefty.

"“Very stylish but not too good” Went here on an extended business trip and first of all was taken by the modern and stylish reception area as well as the nice outside bar, which you would not expect in such a location. Very close to Central Park, Columbus Circle Tube and a short stroll to Fifth Avenue or Broadway. However, even that i was upgraded into a ""suite"" the room was still quite small and that they had a quick renovation of a former old style hotel into something which should be cutting-edge. Not fully completed the job here. Bed was very good and had a good sleep, but doors where so thin you could here everybody passing outside. Nice breakfast area and good atmosphere and buffet here. The hotel also has a terrace on the 15th floor where you can enjoy drinks with a view over Manhattan. Quite cool! Overall a kind of mixed experience.

"“You can't go wrong!” After reading some negative reviews I was apprehensive about staying at the Hudson Hotel in NY. Everything I read was true, there is no sign outside of the hotel, it is very dark, the rooms are very small and the food was very good. 
If you are planning to stay there or considering a stay - need not worry! I would absolutely stay there again. They had what's most important - clean, quiet rooms, courteous staff, and a great location: right across the street from a subway station and a block away from Central Park. Times Square is an easy walk as well as 5th Avenue and FAO Schwartz. 
When we first arrived, the room we were assigned smelled really strongly of smoke. The front desk happily changed rooms for us and the second one was impeccable. The rooms are very small. The TV was tiny, but nobody goes to NY to watch TV. The standard rooms consist of a bed and a tiny bathroom, but they were more than adequate for the two of us. They made good use of the small space with hooks and shelves in the bathroom. Speaking of the bathrooms – in pictures, the pane of glass in the shower I thought was a little revealing with no privacy, but they do actually have a curtain on each side of the glass which was a relief.
The Hudson cafeteria had great food. The service was poor, and breakfast is over priced, but at least the food was good! The lounge seemed loud and happening, but once you got off the elevator it was peacefully quiet. Outside of 1,000 doors slamming loudly in the hallway every morning, you couldn't hear your neighbors or people roaming the halls. 
If I could give the hotel one suggestion for improvement it would be the bedding. No real mattress cover - just a ""throw"" under the sheets. The sheets weren't fitted either so they often came un-tucked during the night which was annoying. The beds themselves were comfortable enough, although very much like a futon. 
Overall, the room rates were a bit over priced, but what hotel isn't in NY? The front desk staff was accommodating. The lobby was beautiful. The rooms are clean and have great temperature control.

"“Beware the room size” The Hudson is a stylish hotel situated very close to Central Park on 58th St. Extremely handy for Columbus Circle subway it is very easy to travel to most parts of the city from there. 
The hotel does not announce itself. The building's exteroir is very bland and does not even have it's name on the front. All the public areas in the Hudson are beautifully furnished and decorated. Having said that, I might be wrong as the reception areas were hardly lit in a 'trendy' way.
Our stay was spoiled by the size of the room. It was minute with a postage stamped size bathroom to match. Barely big enough for one person let alone two, There was very little hanging space and no shelves or drawers. As a consequence, for our 3 night stay we had to leave our clothes in suitcases on the floor which restricted space even more. The air conditioning was the noisiest I have ever heard, and although we were on the 11th floor the noise from the street was constant. 
On the plus side the room's decor (similar to the public areas) was very nicely done in dark wood. 
When we tried to change our room all we were offered was a very expensive upgrade.

"“Not worth the hype” It wasn't a horrible experience, but I'm glad I didn't pay rack rate; my rate was $199 throughTravelzoo.com. 
The lobby decor does not strike me as modern, chic, hip, fun, etc. It's dark, and in the back of my head I couldn't help but think of how much you can hide by dimming the lights, using dark paneling, and painting the walls and ceilings grey. I didn't think the bar was particularly hip, chic, or fun, either. I visited the bar once, a glass of house wine cost me $14, and there was hardly anyone there. 
Basic room is not small, it's itty bitty. I'm only sleeping there, so I don't really care, but traveler's should be aware that the standard room is only about 9.5' x 9.5'. It barely fits a bed, with a 13"" TV inside the narrow cabinet. The wall that separates the bedroom from the bath is glass, obviously to give the illusion of more space. 
I (woman alone) was put in the last room at the very end of the hallway, which I understand is a no-no in the industry. My room's door frame was cracked, and the chain lock hung on by one screw ... not very secure. The door wouldn't latch properly right away because of the crack (looked like maybe someone tried to kick the door in), so I asked the front desk to send someone up to look at it. When I showed him the cracked door, he jotted it down in his notebook to make sure someone looked at it, but made no offer of a more secure room for me. 
Breakfast restaurant is another very dark room, and was absolutely freezing cold on the two March mornings that I ate there (quickly, as it was so cold I couldn't wait to leave).
I just checked the Hudson website, and today's rack rate is about $499. That is just mind boggling to me! This hotel is so not worth it!",QQ2008,2008-03-01,223023,2008-08-12,False,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The tv in this room was nice oh but it didn't work. they worked on it sevral times with no clue what they were doing.

You take an escalator up to the lobby, which is very cool and happening. At night, there is a raging party going on in the bar scene.

"“Great location with modern vibe” Pros - Great location one block from Central Park and one block from the subway. This hotel has a young hip and modern vibe which can make you feel like part of the in crowd staying here. If you like the bar scene then this hotel has a big one right in the lobby plus an outdoor terrace that looked lovely in the photos - we unfortunately did not see it in person as it was closed during the times we thought to check it out. The front desk staff were helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs.
Cons - The public areas and hallways are very, very dark. Although it is part of the look they are going for it is somewhat annoying to not be able to see anything in the lobby unless you go stand under a lamp. Also the hotel has no name outside so you have to be lucky to get a cab driver that knows exactly where it is at. The rooms are tiny but unless you are staying at a $400 dollar a night hotel this is what you get in NYC. Finally the hallways and elevators are not air conditioned so by the time you get to your room you are sweating!

Every time, yes, every time I dried my hair, the electricity in the room would go off. It would take them an average of 20 minutes each time to reset the breaker.

"“Boutique chique. Loved it!” We went to the Hudson Hotel for our first wedding anniversary. It was everything we had hoped for and more. I really do not get all those people on here who moan about the hotel, you can see what the hotel is like when you book it!
The hotel is atmospheric, lively and funky. It is dimly lit but that is what makes the hotel what it is. The bar is amazing and totally original, the outside park is a great place to enjoy drinks in the evening and the sky terrace is a great place to watch the sun go down with a few cocktails and to see the night lights. All of the features in the hotel are quirky and add excitement to the whole feel of the hotel. It is very well located too, right next to central park and the time warner centre (the most amazing bakery in there!) and very close to the subway that goes direct to most areas.
The rooms are fairly small yes, but aren't they all in New York?! We stayed in a standard queen and we had more than enough room to move around without feeling too cramped. The view was great too. The bathroom was very small and sitting on the loo was an experience to say the least, you can kiss the wall whilst sitting on the loo. But very handy when you need to go to the loo in the middle of the night and can use it as a head rest!

The decor is really trendy and the whole vibe of the place is funky.
The location of the hotel is great. Central Park, Broadway and 5th Ave all within walking distance. The rooms are on the smaller side, but I found that we really didn't spend that much time in the room other than to sleep and shower etc.

"“The Strangest Hotel I've Ever Stayed At...Not Necessarily a Bad Thing” Upon arriving at the Hudson, there was no sign outside telling us we had arrived, but that was a part of the Hudson's mystique. While I was staying there, all of the cab drivers knew where to go when we told them to take us to the Hudson Hotel (I think there was only 1 who didn't in the 4 days I was there). When we walked in, the decor was very surreal, from the glowing escalators to the chandeliers to the garden. The check-in staff and the concierge were very, very friendly and helpful. Then we headed over to the elevator. The wait for an elevator (at any point in the day) was quite long. Sometimes, we'd take a down elevator to the basement when we wanted to go up, just so we wouldn't miss it. Also, the elevators didn't appear to be air conditioned, and they got really hot. When we got to the hallway, it was strangely dark, but incredibly modern. Upon arriving at our room, it was.....small. It was actually the smallest hotel room I'd ever seen. It was smaller than my childhood bedroom (and that was small). If you can picture a double bed with about 12 - 18 inches around it, that is the size of a the main room. There is also a tiny bathroom, and that pretty much sums up the room. As I said, amazingly small. The decor was very ""cool"" however, and my comment on the room is that it were 3 - 4 times bigger, it would have been an incredible room because of the décor (and comparable in size to the average NYC hotel room). The bed was also very comfortable. However, we were in NYC, so we didn't want to spend much time in the room, which was the one saving grace.
Another interesting fact about the hotel is that it doubles as a night club. We went out on Saturday night (to a nightclub) and when we returned (at about 4am) there was a line-up outside our hotel (quite a long line for 4am) for the nightclub at the hotel. However, I just flashed my key to the doorman and he let me right through.
The only other insight I had on the hotel was the cost of the drinks. Very pricey. We went to the hotel bar (outside patio area) for a drink before our night on the town. There were 4 of us and I ordered 4 drinks and it was $64. Nothing fancy either, a Jack and Coke, a Gin and Tonic and 2 vodka martinis. Drinks in NYC tend to be expensive, but not that expensive. Those were the 4 most expensive drinks I bought on my 4 day trip.
On the whole, it was a very cool concept hotel, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. The rooms were small, but original. The decor was awesome. The atmosphere was very cool.

"“Don't bring your kids.....” After speaking to the hotel twice about our stay including our kids they never said that there were STRICT limitations on what the kids can do at the hotel after 5PM when the entire hotel (with the restaturant as the sole exception) turns into 5 bar areas and is off limits to kids! Yikes!! They should have told us as it would have certainly enabled us to make changes. So you have to hang out in the (as you have heard from others) tiny tiny rooms. I spoke to the Hotel Manager on our first day and his response was to provide a list of things for kids to do (most activities wrapped at 5PM so it was useless) and a list of other hotels I could call to look into moving to. Weak. Being a ""family"" vacation, kids are with us at all times - as a result, visits to the roof top deck or other places had to be done without my spouse and that limited (uh, eliminated) our enjoyment of these areas. Would have been nice if they pushed this ""no kids allowed"" limit to later in the day (8PM?) and/or roped off small sections were kids can hang out. To make matters worse, the TV reception was horrible so in-room activities were limited. And don't expect to have that flat screen shown on the web site. One last thing, we have a loud air conditioner right above our bed and the comination of that with the NYC street sounds made for difficult sleeping (IOW - bring earplgs).

"“The Hudson is fabulous!” The Hudson is not for everybody. I repeat: The Hudson is not for everybody. But I absolutely love it. LOVE IT! When I travel I don't like to stay at chain hotels if possible, and I especially love hotels with style. The Hudson obviously has plenty of that.
Yes, the rooms are small. But when I'm in NYC I don't plan to hang out in my room much. I'd rather stay in a small, fabulous room, than a huge, floral bedspread-clad one. Just a personal preference.
The Hudson is in a great location, right by Time Warner Center and Columbus Circle. But that obviously doesn't matter too much, since you're in NYC and you can take a cab or the subway somewhere else if you'd like.
If you feel cramped in the small rooms but you want to hang out at the hotel, just grab a chair in the lobby and relax there. Great music to listen to, which is also a plus for me.

"“Amazing Stay!!” Most people would automatically assume that when you’re staying at a hotel in New York City, you’re not staying in a hotel room that’s palatial in size unless you’ve upgraded to a suite at the Mandarin Oriental. That being said, what the hotel room itself lacked in expansiveness, it more than made up for with its features. 
Upon arrival at the hotel you feel like something out of mid-80’s video but not in a cheesy way as the trek up the neon green escalator to the lobby area made for a more exciting ride. The lobby was lots of fun from the funky furniture to the high ceilings covered with ivy. Our room wasn’t ready when we checked in, but we were guided where to go to store our luggage until we returned back to the hotel. A man by the name of Josh took our belongings and lickity split, we were off. Upon our return back to the hotel, my boyfriend got our room key and I the luggage and we ventured off to the 12th floor to see what we were in store for. 
I really enjoyed the hotel room, it was crisp, it was very clean and spacious enough for 2 people to get by and get around just fine. Granted, yes, the bathroom was very small and we have some difficulties maneuvering around one another when both of us were in there at the same time, but he shaved while I blew my hair out in the hall just outside and we adjusted just fine. But, the bathroom had a feature that I really enjoyed. Don’t be frightened away by the description of the see-through glass shower door. It was a great feature, one person in the shower, one person on the bed watching you shower, just make sure to move the desk chair and you get a great view to a voyeuristic show. That being said, maybe some people aren’t into that, or maybe knowing that you’d be more intrigued to book your stay here (that and the hotel offered a “love” kit….we didn’t indulge, but it’s there in case you need it).
The bed was comfy, although I wasn’t quite sure about the pillows, I may have just gotten a bad batch. I tried to switch them up when my boyfriend wasn’t paying attention, but started getting confused and couldn’t remember whose were whose. I enjoyed the 2 big mirrors on the wall, and don’t be scared, they’re not floor to ceiling “no-tell motel” type mirrors, but it was nice to see double of yourself while finishing up to get done and head out. And okay, so the TV was small and the alarm clock wasn’t iPod compatible, but just call to the front desk for a wake up call and you don’t really have to worry about it.
The a/c worked really well, maybe the others that stayed here didn’t get quite so lucky, but we were cool in the midst of 95 degree NYC heat. And if you leave the curtain pulled closed, it keeps all of the cool air in the bed area; we kept it pulled shut all night too and actually woke up freezing in the morning.
We hit the Hudson Bar in the hotel on a Saturday night shortly after one, and it was packed, but I think both of us lost steam during our 3 hour dinner at Le Bernardin to rally through and hang out and soak up the scene, but it was definitely a scene. We really enjoyed the relaxed outdoor bar just outside the lobby. Just beware that they close early, 11:30 p.m., as there are actual residents that live in the hotel who complain about the noise. So we just carried it inside to the library bar, sat ourselves on a nice plush leather couch and closed out that bar too (closes at 1:00 a.m.).
The few complaints we had were minor, if anything to write about. Just know that you can’t bring outside drinks to the rooftop lounge on the 15th floor, which I learned while sipping a frappuccino, which I thought was a little absurd. And although I didn’t have much interaction with the hotel staff, my boyfriend just described some of them as harsh (and we’re both former New Yorkers, so that attitude has to be worth something)
The hotel itself was convenient to some great attractions, Central Park, the museums, etc. The subway was just around the corner and it was easy to grab a cab. We’ve now stayed at two Ian Schrager hotels, both have had special meanings to us, but this was the most fun, at least in my book.
For the value, the location and the features offered, it was worth the stay, we really enjoyed ourselves. For young couples who are looking to get away and not spend a fortune, you’ll have a great time here, we certainly did!",Greenie319,2008-07-01,223023,2008-07-22,False,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“It was OK” This was the strangest place I have ever stayed. First, there are no signs to tell you that you are in the right place, you have to remember what it looks like from the pictures. Second, the hallways are very (I do mean very) dark. When stepping off the elevator you have to give your eyes a minute to adjust. Third, there is no top sheet on the bed. You get a bottom sheet and a comforter (no second sheet), which I thought was really strange. 
We were on the 11th floor and could hear the music from the club on Friday night. Not loud but could hear it nonetheless. 
Our only real problem was that our bathtub was not clean and had a clog in it. The staff was nice and gave good recommendations for eating.",travelmom42008,2008-07-01,223023,2008-07-22,False,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Fab for the money!” My mother and I spent this past wknd at the hotel (July 18-20). It was our first experience with the Hudson as we won the room for $200/night on Priceline. I was very excited to see I had won it b/c I've read about the Hudson and knew how chic it appeared to be. I was not disappointed and neither was my 65 y/o mother. 
I knew what the exterior looked like b/c I checked out its website; that way I knew what to look for when we arrived. We couldn't believe our eyes when we got off the escalator and entered the lobby. Ultra chic is the term that comes to mind. Not stuffy either. 
The front desk attendant that helped us, Chris, was very helpful and friendly. He asked if this was our first visit and when I confirmed that he said he would upgrade us to a complimentary larger room. We were so excited when we stepped into our room with dark wood floors and lovely dark wood walls. I have stayed in NYC hotels with smaller rooms so I was happy with the space in this room, though it was not spacious by any means. 
The showerhead was great and the water temp got very hot (a big plus for me!) My only complaint may be minor to some. The bathroom floor and shower were white tiles. I saw more mildew in the grout than I cared to see in such a lovely hotel but it wasn't the end of the world for me.
I can not comment on the bar or the restaurant as I did not take advantage of them. My mother did get coffee each morning in the bar and was flabbergasted by the $5 pricetag. I reminded her we are in NY after all.She did say the breakfast buffet looked lovely but we skipped it both days.
I would highly reco this hotel to friends. I hope to stay here again.",travellingmama07,2008-07-01,223023,2008-07-20,False,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“I found nothing wrong with it.” This was my first holiday in years and my first trip to New York.
I was a bit nervous about the hotel after reading the reviews here but shouldn't have been.
I only spoke to the front desk staff when I checked in and checked out and, both times, they were polite and helpful.
The rooms ARE very small but they're always clean and well presented. The bed's are very comfortable, by the way.
Make sure you get a room quite high up as there is a disco playing everey night and it's LOUD!!!!
A comforting security detail is that there's a security guard standing by the elevators at night, checking that you're a guest. 
Now, the bathroom. My only complaints refer to the bathroom. There is only a space of about 7 inches between the front of the toilet and the wall. Sitting down is not a comfortable experience unless you can do the splits.
I'm surprised nobody's mentioned the tiles on the floor in the showers. I have a bath at home, so maybe I'm missing something basic, but I found the tiles to be almost lethally slippy. There were quite a few times I was taking a shower and nearly slipped on the tiles and fell.
Another minor gripe was the time it took for the elevators to arrive. I think it would be quicker if certain elevators went to the even numbered floors and the others went to the odd numbered ones.
The location is excellent. A 3 minute walk to the Subway. 5 minutes to Central Park and about 10 to 15 minutes to 5th Avenue.

"“Hidden Chick” First of all, we didn't know we had arrived at the hotel. There are no signs outside of the hotel. Where were no numbers either. I just saw a bunch of people in black shirts hanging out in front. We pulled up in our rental car to ask if this was the Hudson Hotel. They were nice to let us leave the car in the front while we checked in.
When I walked into our room, I thought I was in the wrong place. The room is small and cramped. The first thing I noticed was the damp moldy smell and the dirty rag odor from the bathroom. I immediately called the front office to speak to the manager. After I was tranferred three times, I finally spoke to him. I told him my situation and he asked me if I wanted to be moved. Of course, why would I be calling? He didnt' tell me what room but send up a bellhop to move our bags and us to another room. The new room was just as small but no odor. 
As you can read from the other reviews, the rooms are small. We have stayed in bigger hotel rooms in the city for about the same or cheaper. We were just thankful it was the just two of us. There is not much room to move or stretch in this room. For the chick modern look of this hotel, we thought they could invest more in the tv. We were at least hoping for a flatscreen hanging from the ceiling. The tv was about 12 inches. We had a bigger tv on the cruise ship we just got off from. The hallways and elevators were not well air conditioned. It got hot at times in the summer heat. 
In front of the elevators on very floor, there are ice, snack and soda machines. They are behind a closet. They is also high table with three chairs. It was almost like your own cafe. The toiletries were nice. Everything was simple and nice but definitely not for a family with kids. The room is too small to move around. It's a good thing we were here for business and not pleasure. 
The best thing about this hotel is the location. You can shopping at the mall across the street. You can take a walk to Central Park. You can taxi to Broadway.",wel0ve2vacati0n,2008-07-01,223023,2008-07-19,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Eh...So-So” Location- The location was excellent. Close enough to see the sights but far enough to avoid the tourist traps and noise. Once you figure out the correct exit to take out of the subway terminal (Columbus Circle/59th), it’s about a 4-block walk to the hotel. Neighborhood was quiet and safe. There are several diners, pharmacies, grocers and food stands in the area. It’s about an 8-block walk to FAO Schwartz and 10 blocks to Central Park. 
Hotel- There is absolutely NO marking outside the hotel to indicate the location. Had I not studied the pictures before hand, I would have passed it up more than once. The entrance is very odd. It’s a yellow building with a single door that looks like it’s the backdoor of a shipping warehouse. Once you enter, you go through a double-sided glass door and up an escalator to the lobby. The hotel is poorly lit and the dark wood makes it hard to see. It definitely has a nightclub feel. (Which I believe is the idea) There is an outside patio to enjoy drinks at and a bar/library where you can shoot pool. A cafeteria is on sight but it is $24 per person for an all-you-can-eat buffet. Internet access is $10 per day.
Rooms- The rooms were very modern and very small. (Even for NY standards) They were impeccably clean. The bed was comfortable and only stood two feet off the ground. You have probably 2 feet of space on either side of the bed before the mirrored walls block you. There is probably only 4 feet of space at the foot of the bed. Whoever mentioned that it was the size of a cruise ship cabin was dead on. The TV is only 13” and hidden in a cabinet along with a CD player. There is a small desk that serves no purpose other than to have a space for personal belongings. The bathrooms are horrid. From the bathroom wall to the shower is literally about the dimensions of an average sized closet. To boot, you are separated from the bedroom and the shower by a thin, translucent, white curtain. (No doors) So, if you are traveling with someone else, they are forced to watch you shower and use the restroom if you like to have the light on whilst doing your business. If it’s your spouse/partner, you probably aren’t breaking any new ground. It’s a little awkward for the kiddies though. The hotel has a club downstairs and we could hear faint traces of the music on the 10th floor.
Staff- The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The bellboys in particular were outstanding. I like the fact that we could drop our luggage off before and after our check-in for a small gratuity. At night they have a security guard ensure that you have a room key before letting you on an elevator, which was a nice touch. The staff had a “pretty people” feel complete with model-esq 20-somethings and burly bouncers working security. Everyone was always willing to give you restaurant recommendations or call a cab should you need one.
Value- I won a bid on Priceline and received this hotel. I paid $130 per night, which I feel was fair given the location and amenities. However, I would not have paid the $280 per night price tag that their website was offering. It’s a good hotel if location is your highest priority. If you are looking for a little more space, or have more than one traveler, I’d recommend staying elsewhere.",Spankytoes,2008-07-01,223023,2008-07-14,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Horrible, horrible hotel. Stay elsewhere.” Absolutely nothing went right at this lame excuse for a hotel. We checked in and they were supposed to deliver our bags to our room in ""10 minutes."" An hour passed, they still were not there and we had dinner reservations soon. I called and called the belop, nobody answered. I called the front desk and they transfer me to the bellhop before even letting me say they don't answer. This happened a few times before finally somebody talked to me, put me on hold and said ""they are not answering; I don't know what to tell you."" Called back again a half hour later and somebody said the manager was looking into it and would call me back ""promptly."" Nobody called me back. My bag was delivered hours later after I went around the halls and tracked down the bellman. We had to cancel dinner with friends.
The room - I've had cruise ship cabins bigger than this. The room basically fits a bed and that's it. The tv is tucked up in a closet and is so small you can barely see it. For all of the reviewers who say small rooms like this are to be expected in NY, where? I've stayed at many, many NY hotels in all different price ranges and have never seen a room this small. And the bathroom is so tiny I kid you not that you can barely sit down to use the toilet; my legs squeezed up against the wall and I am only 5'10"".
And quite possibly the worst of all, one afternoon at around 3 pm somebody (I assume from housekeeping) entered our room without knocking and my wife was standing there undressed doing her hair. It should have been obvious people were in the room - the hairdryer was on and music was playing. This person stood there - with the door wide open! - and asked if our room had been cleaned and a few other questions before finally leaving. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY NOT CLOSE THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU WALK IN ON SOMEBODY NAKED! I left a message for the manager and nobody ever called me back.

"“Nice Room... that's it.” I will make this short and sweet...
Hotel rooms are small, but they are just fine. 
Hotel and rooms were always clean.
I do not like clubs and did not realize that there was one on the main floor. With that, I always felt under-dressed and ""snubbed"" upon arriving and exiting (by staff and guests).
Don't count on room service, you'll save time walking a few blocks and going out.

"“THIEVES AND SCOUNDRELS!!!” Okay, I know that NY hotels are expensive... I've stayed at a few, but this is the first time I've ever paid 250 a night for a closet! I didn't realize how small a hotel room could be until I saw this! I thought it was a joke at first, like maybe I was in the entryway, and I kept looking for the door to the main room! The bathroom... oh my god... let's just say you'd better be travelling alone if you stay here. They stuck a cheap glass wall up to separate it from the bed... so effectively, you can see every detail of someone taking a shower, or worse. If you can manage to even sit on the toilet, it could be quite embarrasing. The sink is so small, that when you turn it on, water shoots everywhere. Horrible... It is obvious that at some point the rooms in this hotel were normal sized, but had been remodeled so that 2 rooms could be made out of one. You'll see floor plans here and there that show some normal sized rooms here and there. Guess we just got unlucky on that one. 
The good stuff... twin bed was obviously small but decent, AC worked well... um, that's about it. So much bad stuff happened during our stay there that paled in comparrison.
On our second night there, the fire alarm in our room started going off at 5 in the morning. It took 3 phone calls to the lobby and finally a groggy, short tempered personal visit down there before they even attempted to fix it. Just a stupid battery and I had to spend 2 hours of the wee morning dealing with it. By the time someone finally did come to the room, the alarm had apparantly ran out of juice. Hilarious!! 
On our last day there, we came back to the hotel room to find a bill for 75 bucks from their restaurant... which we never set foot in. At this point, I'm like... is there someone that works for this hotel, whose job it is to make your stay as inconvenient, frustrating, and uncomfortable as possible!?!? Went down to the lobby to disbute the bill, and they made us stand there for half an hour while they tried to look for a reciept. Of course they couldn't find it, which meant that it most likely wasn't just another guest mistakenly signing his food to the wrong room... but something else entirely. Some sort of skimming by the hotel employees?
See if anyone notices?
The people in the lobby were for the most part, extremely rude every time there was an issue. Nobody really seemed to want to attempt to correct a situation, or even apologize for any inconvenience... Of which there were many. Sometimes there are unavoidable circumstances when things go wrong, and I can understand this. If you have a friendly and accomodating staff, they can usually keep the problems caused by these inconveniences to a minimum, sometimes even with something as simple as an apology. 
NOT GONNA HAPPEN HERE.
At this point, somebody needs to step forward and offer an apology for this entire mess of a hotel. This hotel is NOT cheaper that any other we've stayed in in NY. Just a WHOLE LOT WORSE!!!! If you end up staying there after reading this review, you'll see what I mean. When you pull up to the hotel, there's no sign... nothing. Looks like the side of a warehouse. There's no excuse for a mess like this in such a great city.
Oh, and one last thing, watch your credit card carefully upon returning from a trip to this hotel... A week after getting home, we noticed they charged us for a hotel we checked out from the concierge, claiming we didn't return it. WE SIGNED IT IN!!! HOW COULD THEY SCREW THIS UP!?!?!? Another argument over the phone and they credited us back the money.
Seriously, there is some shady stuff afoot here, and someone, or many someones in this organization are trying their best to randomly charge guests for stuff they didn't use, hoping to get away with it. 
I've had bad experiences with hotels in the past, sure... but nothing yet has compared to the Hudson Hotel.

"“Perfect Location” Loved the hotel! Yes, there are small rooms, but there are also larger rooms, so be clear what you ask for when you make reservations. 
The public spaces are really lovely. Food at the Cafeteria (the hotel restaurant) was delicious, and we tried three different meals there. Pricey, but that is expected when you eat at any hotel restaurant. Concierge was helpful at every turn, and even sent up a birthday cake unsolicited for my daughter's 8th birthday.
Bellmen were happy to secure our luggage after we checked out so we could take one last tour before our flight out. 
Add to that the terrific location--a subway stop on the same block, a very short walk to Central Park, Time Warner, Lincoln Center, and Carnegie Hall an easy walk away. You really can get to any part of Manhattan very easily from the hotel, and without the extreme crowds you get closer to Times Square.
If you want cheaper eats in the neighborhood, walk west on 58th. The Flame restairant on the corner is a good diner and had very reasonable prices.

"“I'll pass next time” The Hudson Hotel was cramped (rooms are 162 sq. ft), pricey, uncomfortable (a cacophony of construction which blared right into the room starting at the crack of dawn), and a little too full of itself in projecting the hipster boutique vibe (the narrow corridors were eerily dark and not very well air conditioned). The Hudson is a fine choice if you're going to spend a minimal amount of time in the room and instead plan to hang out in the very popular garden bar, airy, greenery-laced lobby or any number of spots in the Columbus Circle area.",Tejas1,2008-06-01,223023,2008-07-10,False,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great Hotel - Even if You're Not Uber Chic” We just returned from a three-night stay at the Hudson. 
Our family of four shared a superior queen room. (Having used Priceline's ""Name Your Own Price"" and unwittingly agreeing to a double occupancy room. . .but, that's another story. . .)
I'll admit to a little anxiety before our arrival. I had phoned the hotel a few times trying to resolve the room issue and while on hold was assured via taped message that the Hudson was not just a place to sleep - we were to become one with our environment. . .yikes! And, when someone mentioned seeing Lucy Liu at the bar. . .I was wondering if this was the best place for my 7 and 10 year-old children.
Upon arrival we were greeted at the curb and our luggage was taken to be delivered to our room after check-in. We took the escalator up to the lobby and were impressed with the beautiful indoor/outdoor effect created by the ivy-covered walls, carved desk and skylights. The gentleman who checked us in was courteous and professional, and after eyeing our foursome upgraded us to a larger room which would accomodate a roll-away bed (at no additional cost to us.)
As others have noted, the hallways are painted gray, and the lighting is dim, but we could always read the signs and get our key in the door. The rooms are small, but comfortable. And, everything is CLEAN. The hardwood floors give you peace of mind. All of the bedding is crisp and white. I didn't get the skeevy feeling I sometimes have while traveling.
The location was great. We were right across the street from Columbus Circle and great shopping. Central Park is just a couple of blocks north. Times Square is a comfortable walk down Broadway.
The only bump in the road came our last morning. We had been told on the phone that we could add breakfast to our room for $18 (adult) when we came to the hotel. We decided to treat ourselves to breakfast in the ""Cafeteria."" I inquired about the discounted rate at the desk, and was told that there's really no difference in price, and we should just pay the restaurant directly. $103 later, we left the Cafeteria. The buffet was $27 (not $18) per person, with a half charge for children. Not worth the price.
Also, the second night my husband went downstairs to get a drink at the bar. He came back 3 minutes later saying he wasn't dressed appropriately. For other cargo shorts/polo shirt wearing 40 year-olds visiting the Hudson, there's a restaurant/bar down the street called the Coliseum. Foods OK and beer is cold.

"“Great Place to Crash” Upon arrival (as other reviewers have stated), I had trouble finding the hotel with no numbers or sign. However, definitely enjoyed the atmosphere of the hotel. 
The rooms, as expected, were tiny but clean. I booked through priceline and got the room for less than $175/night, so I feel the value was good, however, would not pay full price for this room. 
The location couldn't have been better. Columbus Circle station is right across the street, Starbucks is close and it's a short walk to the Theatre District/Times Square. 
All in all, this was an OK place. Beware - drinks are rediculously expensive ($9 for a bottle of Corona - UGH!)

“Hudson Stole my Money the week Before X-mas” I booked this Hotel as x-mas gift to wife for Dec 16. shopping and Broadway trip. I booked the hotel on Priceline which I will never use again. I bought travel insurance trough Priceline another scam. I was informed by Jetblue ( Jetblue Customer Service is the Best) the day before my flight was cancelled. This was due to snowstorm that had been causing problems along the whole northeast region. I booked a later flight with hopes storm would end. I called Jetblue just before heading to airport. They had cancelled that flight. I called the Hudson Hotel Immediately and was informed that canceling my room receiving a refund would not be a problem. This turned out to be a big lie. They later informed me that since Booked with Priceline I was not entitled to refund from them. The desk personal and Useless Management made no effect to contact me that I could not cancel my reservation.

"“Hudson OK” We found the Hudson through Priceline - great price. The hotel was OK - clean, comfortable and convenient - but way too self-consciously hip for my taste. Chartreuse neon escalators and techno music pounding in the elevators didn't do it for me. The hotel says it's trying to recreate the experience of being in a stateroom in an old-fashioned ocean liner, which is a good way of explaining 150 square foot rooms. Teeny! But very well designed, and not unattractive. The staff was always helpful and pleasant, although we are undemanding and didn't have a lot of staff interactions. We loved the location - very close to Lincoln Center, which was our primary destination this trip. I don't think we'd stay again by choice, for the rack rate we can find places we like better - but it was a good Priceline buy!",clarefd,2008-07-01,223023,2008-07-07,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Buzzy hudson” Loved this hotel, great location, good food, excellent nightlife - there and nearby. Rooms a bit small as to be expected for new york, but very good. The bar / nightclub in the hotel is fab!!

"“Shamefully small rooms and bathroom” The nearly unusable bathroom and room (8' X9' at most) at the Hudson outweighed any of the hotel's other ""cool"" features--an unusally furnished rooftop lounge, zany library, and cool-for-20-somethings bar. Also unremarkable and inconvenient for many was the second floor lobby, accessible by a long escalator from the fron t(unmarked) door. 
But back to the bathroom, it was smaller than the two cruise ship bathrooms I've seen. Pardon the graphic visual, but my husband could not use the toilet sitting down, lest his knees get crushed by the facing wall. The bedroom walls were no farther than two feet from the edge of the queen bed, the TV was tiny. Lastly, the ventilation in the halls and elevator was insufferable. We got this on Priceline and loved the location, but all the other compromises were NOT worth $200 a night.",zadesheher,2008-06-01,223023,2008-07-02,False,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“chic NY stay” My friend and I stayed at the Hudson for 3 nights in Oct/07. I had done plenty of research prior to choosing a hotel. The Hudson isn't exactly a 'budget stay', but it is a good price when compared with other boutique hotels in NY. As for the location, I thought it was pretty good. The Columbus Circle subway station is SO close -- it was really handy. 
We arrived only a few hours prior to check-in time, but were told our room would not be free until that time. So we went to the restaurant to eat and kill some time. When we did finally get our room, I wasn't too shocked. I had been forwarned about the SMALL rooms, but we had booked a room for 2 ppl with 2 double beds. Good thing!! We had no issues with space in the bedroom -- it was just great for the two of us and our massive suitcases. 
The room was clean, crisp, and cool. Design was nice; beds were comfortable, and good linens/towels throughout.
What we didn't like: 1) Not enough lights! The bathroom is the only place to do your makeup, and still a bit dim. 2) Not enough hangers in the closet (why do hotels always do that?!) 3) Not enough counter space in the bathroom for us to lay out our stuff. 4) TV etc didn't work. Am sure they would have come to fix this but we didn't bother since we weren't in the room much.
As for the other hotel services:
I called the concierge about a week in advance to make a bunch of lunch/dinner reservations throughout NYC. She was fantastic, and got everything booked. And, when we got to our first dinner, she had arranged for complimentary champagne -- wow!! 
The bar is pretty hip; love the glowing dancefloor! We only made it to the bar on a sunday night and it wasn't too busy, but not dead either. A good scene; pricey drinks (typical..!).
The rest of the desk/bellboy staff was quite good. No attitude from anyone. My room bill had something extra on it that I had not ordered, and they removed it from the bill without fuss. The staff that got our bags for us and got us a taxi upon leaving were wonderful; made us sad to be leaving!
I would say that the Hudson makes for a great 'base camp' in NY if you are looking for a hip place to crash after a long day/night out on the town.",design_snob,2007-10-01,223023,2008-07-01,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“great hang out place horrible to sleep (bed)” we stayed in the studio which was like a normal size hotel room anywhere outside the city for sure.

the bed needs to be renewed fast! we stayed here for 2 weeks and our back were killing us! the bed in the studio is a queen and if you have no fat you can feel all the coils and it 'sinks' in the middle.

"“Very Clean” My most important suggestion - go to the hotel's website (www.hudsonhotel.com) and memorize what the front of the hotel looks like. You'll need this visual, as the outside of the hotel is not labelled. There are no signs. It's the strangest thing.
The inside is very nice, but they use dark wood everywhere. So it's a fairly dark hotel. I may not have felt safe walking to my room, only because the hallways are dark, as well. The only lighting is such that each of the doors are lit (they are painted white). Otherwise, they use dark paint in the hallways, and there are no other lights.
We had a 1-bed room. It was small, but no less than what I would expect in NYC. The bathroom was fairly tight, and if you're tall, you may have difficulty sitting on the toilet unless you sit diagonally.
The bathroom and bedroom were impeccably clean. The bed was very firm, but comfortable. My only complaint in the room is that we could hear horns from the street until at least 1 or 2 in the morning. Eventually another pillow on top of my head muffled the sounds enough that I could sleep. We never heard any of the other rooms, so in that regard it was quiet.
The tv was the smallest I've ever seen in a hotel, but it was fine. Lots of channels.
There was a CVS and grocery right on the corner, so you can save major money and buy your water and snacks there. (The water in the room was the most expensive I've EVER seen.)

"“Hip Hotel” The Hudson hotel is a hip and trendy boutique hotel in NYC. It has a modern and posh feel to it from the moment you walk in the door and ride the escalator up to the lobby.
My only complaints with this hotel are:
1) Location - its in midtown west. I prefer Soho or meatpacking district as I like those neighborhoods better. I like the shopping, restaurants, nightlife, etc. Also for business people, I like to be close to the financial district.
2) Size of Rooms - my room was TINY - it was actually the smallest hotel room I have every seen in my life. It was almost claustrophobic. Most hotel rooms in NYC are small, but this was unbelievable.",GlobalJana,2008-03-01,223023,2008-06-27,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Not the Four Seasons. Trying too hard to be hip.” The facts: I paid about $300/night. Breakfast for two all-in: $60. Martini + coke: $26. Bottled water & coke: $20. Crime: daily internet: $10. 
The bad experience: There is an outdoor patio behind the lobby front desk in addition to the roof-top area. Part of this patio is for the restaurant. Part is to just hang out--until, as I came to find out, 4pm when it somehow becomes a bar. I plop down at a table at 4:15pm and promptly plug in my phone and laptop (the hotel requires to you to search for outlets--this is harder than it has to be with the dim lighting). I waitress takes my order and returns with it. At 4:25, the power is inexplicably cut from my outlets. Weird, right? I flag down the waitress at 4:30 when she says ""laptops are not allowed after 4pm b/c of liability, but I know several others are here with them, so maybe it will be OK."" At 4:45, some guy (the bar manager) comes over and repeats this 'not allowed' stuff twice, says ""thank you"" while walking away in the condescending way that can only be done well in New York. I just paid for drinks and internet access so what do I do? Leave and argue the charge w/the front desk when I check out the next morning. The *amazing* part is that the front desk is mostly unsympathetic. The process takes 20-30min. to reverse $10 and then they require me to fill out a 'dispute form' which they will then present to the bar manager. What could possibly take them 20-30min. at the front desk to not even resolve it? This is definitely *not* The Four Seasons.
The mediocre experience: I arrived from the airport 9am wanting a place just to change clothes and shower before a 10am mtg. The concierge would not give me a gym pass (to the nearby equinox) until 10am. He was breathtakingly condescending about it. The desk staff was hapless. Jackie appeared to be their manager and yet it still took 45min. to get a room. The looked at me like I was being difficult when I refused a smoking room. There is no other shower (e.g., in the hotel gym).
The good stuff: capital 'a' Amazing roof top on 15. The weather was Mediterranean-perfect during my stay and this place was *the* place to be for working, relaxing, or schmoozing (like the cheezy brokerage firm that reserved part of it on one of the days I was there.)
I like the decor in the lobby, restaurants and room. In multiple ways, the rooms are so small they made me involuntarily say 'wow' (that is small). I have never been in rooms so small--not in Tokyo, Singapore, or Hong Kong. Toilet is in an unfriendly location vis a vis the wall, but aside from that, the space is managed in a way that distinguishes good design. *Everything* is set up to accommodate the small space. After three days, I still didn't feel cramped. It was weird b/c really my office at work is larger than the whole room including the bathroom. Did I mention it was small? :)",abc1234567890,2008-06-01,223023,2008-06-27,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Horrendous customer service” We had a very unpleasant customer service experience. We returned from dinner and sat at a table in the hallway between the lobby and the bar, which, at 9pm on a Tuesday night, was empty. A staff member approached us and (politely) informed us that we were not welcome to use the tables without a purchase from the bar. 
I called the front desk when we returned to our room, and the staff member who answered the phone (less politely) confirmed the policy.
The very notion of asking a hotel guest to leave a common area is appalling from every standpoint. As hotel customers, we will not be back and will advise family and friends to choose competing (non-Morgan) hotels when travelling, in New York or elsewhere.

"“Great Hotel” We stayed at the Hudson from the 17th November 2005 until the 21st November 2005. It was our first trip to NYC.
We chose the hotel because we liked the location and the photographs published. We stayed on a room only basis. At first we were concerned there would not be anywhere to eat a reasonable priced breakfast however, a 2 minute walk down the road is a great café called “Saffee’s” it had a good selection and very reasonably priced.
I have to admit we were a little disappointed on arrival to our room. We did not anticipate how small it would actually be. There was no room to unpack we had to put one suitcase under the table and the other one on the spot allocated for luggage. The room was dominated by the standard double bed. The décor in the room is gorgeous. If the room had been fractionally larger I would have said it was perfect. Although I expect most accommodation in NYC may be similar. We were on the 19th floor which was pretty cool and throughout the night you could hear the city traffic go by (this was not a problem)
The hotel has a great bar. Although being under 21 when I stayed I was unable to experience this part of the hotel. Although I did see Lucy Lui in there one night on the way back to our room. Throughout the hotel it has very trendy décor for example on the terrace there is a giant watering can!
It is a short walk from Columbus Circle where there are many shops and a subway. It is 5 minutes from central park. I wish I had spent more time taking advantage of how close it was to this! You can easily walk to Times Square and 5th Avenue also.
The staff were reasonably friendly and room was always cleaned to a high standard.
I would recommend this hotel however, I would advise you to pack light to avoid the issues we had with space. I hope you find this review helpful.",emma&simon,2005-11-01,223023,2008-06-23,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

I booked on priceline and was worried after reading the reviews of the small rooms. It worked out great, the rooms are clean, the staff is outstanding.

"“Good location but tiny rooms!!” I booked this hotel online through Hotwire.com based on the price and location only...I was told this hotel was 3 1/2 stars. The location is fantastic but as other reviewers mentioned the standard rooms are tiny--only 150 sq ft of which about a quarter of it is the tiny bathroom! I paid about $260 a night which was supposed to be as discounted price, but actually it was pretty close to the rack rate. It seems that you can get a better price on Priceline based on other reviews. I did feel a little ripped off by Hotwire because of this...
but I guess it is NYC!
The room is so small you cannot open up a suitcase without having to step over it to get into bed...and as I was there with my husband and had 3 suitcases in total it was pretty tight! Also, the air conditioner is right behind the bed--it was loud and would cycle on/
off all night. My other complaint is that the hallways are very dark and a little scary to be walking down alone.
As I said before, the location is great--it is just south of Central Park and north of Broadway...within walking distance of many major attractions, restaurants, and shops which did make up for some of the issues we had.
Overall, our stay was okay, but I am glad we were only there for 3 days...much more would have turned me into a claustrophobic!",turtlebabe15,2008-06-01,223023,2008-06-20,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Clean, comfortable, convenient, small” After searching for an affordable hotel, I brokedown and did Priceline. I chose a 3-star hotel and my bid was accepted for $170, and I was given the Hudson. Very fortunate!! My flight was delayed and I called the hotel to ensure my room would be held for late arrival and that I had a non-smoking room; the employee was very friendly and assured me it would be held and NS. When I arrived, the front desk person was genuinely friendly, speedy and helpful. She even sympathized with my travel difficulties. I went up to my room and was a bit surprised at how small it was. Closet alcove held my suitcase and had ample hangers. I had a double bed with about 1.5 or 2 feet on either side; there's a small desk and chair, as well as a small entertainment closet with a 13"" TV and a Sony stereo. Room was immaculately clean with very attractive hardwood floors. Sheets and towels were very soft and comfortable. Shower is cool--clear glass wall that looks out into the room (there is a curtain to pull for privacy.) I'm 6'3"" and had to straddle the toilet as my legs would hit the opposite wall. The size of the room didn't bother me as I was only there to sleep/shower, all of which were fine. Good water pressure/temperature. Near-by cafes and a Duane Reade and CVS (24-hr pharmacies). A corner cafe that has sandwiches, pizza etc. that is open very late, if not 24-hour. Staff was friendly and helpful. I had to mail back a rental tux and they did it for me with no additional fees for packing/ materials. Location is excellent--walking distance to all Midtown/theatre attractions, Times Square, Central Park, etc (but quiet) and close to the subway. I would not hesitate to stay there again. I'm not sure if they have bigger rooms for two people, but for one it was fine. I stayed in room 705. I did not hear noise from the elevator or from cleaning staff in the morning. Lobby is very loud as they have a bar/club there, and that was a little off-putting upon first arrival and a bit hard to hear through the check-in process--that was my only gripe. It was very clean, very comfortable, and very conveniently located. Also, seemed secure; they had a security person stationed at the elevators to the rooms, as well as door men at the front of the building.",TravelGuy72,2008-06-01,223023,2008-06-19,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Small rooms at the Hudson, but not terrible experience” booked three nights here in with my husband through a deal on Travelzoo. first impressions: great staff, attentive and helpful. great lobby. DARK hallways. TINY - but clean - room.
you can tell it's a converted Y. I don't know why they decided that dark grey carpet and dark grey walls were a good way to go for their long tunnel-like hallways - but that's the way it is.
After reading reviews here, I knew the room would be small, and it was, complete with a tiny 13-inch television. No refrigerated mini-bar. 
TINY, CRAMPED BATHROOM. If you weigh over 180lbs or have long legs, be prepared for a struggle to use the bathroom. Thankfully, my husband and I are both average height and weight, but even so, I found myself sitting sideways to use the commode because my knees were literally two inches from the wall when I sat down. Yes, the glass wall between shower and bedroom is there, but that novelty lasts for about oh - two seconds - before you wish that the shower floor drained water better and that there was more space in that teeny tiny bathroom. 
There is free internet, windows are not sound-proofed, and there is a big, loud party every night downstairs in the bar/club. We could not hear the party, but we could hear the street noise, and we were on the 10th floor.
Still - I would still consider staying here again. Why? because if you are prepared for these considerations (tiny rooms, dark hallways) because for the price we paid, ($229 a night), you will find that the best part of the Hudson is not the hotel itself, but ITS LOCATION. it was a bargain to stay in this neighborhood - COLUMBUS CIRCLE is a great location, and close to all the trains, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, CENTRAL PARK IS RIGHT THERE... and the neighborhood is a safe walking area at night. You also have a CVS that is open 24 hours kitty corner on 9th Avenue, and the Time-Warner center with the Whole Foods just down the block.

"“Small Potato in the Big Apple” We got this by priceline in return we where gauranteed a 3-star hotel. After we got here we were in complete shock by the small size of the room.
The hotel could surely pass for a three star under normal circumstances; good ambiance and style, but the size of the room nocks this down at least a half star. To a 2 1/2 star hotel.
My knees litterally touched the wall when I sat on the toilet. If you have ever been on a cruise ship, that is a good estimation of the size of the room.
They even tried to sell me a $5 snicker bar (not even king size)
It definitely was not worth $250/night. If this was not NY this Hotel would not exist due to the tininess.

"“Nice cool hotel in my fav NYC spot, but with a few issues...” Booking 9 days at The Hudson for a nice price was very exciting for me and I coudn't wait for one more NYC trip, the best city in the world, after Rio, naturally.... 
The spot is perfect and I think Columbus Circle is a great strategic point in the island. Here we have acess to many subway lines, buses, taxis, easy nice healthy meals and groceries at the Warner Center Wholefoods Market. You can also walk, what I love to do in NYC, to Central Park, Lincoln Center, Times Square theatres and even to the 5th ave and the East side.
About The Hudson, I think the boutique setting is very attractive and cool, including the room decor, but the size of the standard oom is very, very, veryyyyy tiny(I knew it was small, but if you think small is average small, think again!)!!! Uncomfortable for two, but a single non-shopping person would be fine there, I guess(but does anyone who likes trendy hotels is a non-shooping person?) It is clean and the room service is ok, but absolutely everything is surcharge. The front desk staff and concierges, however, are helpless.

"“Fine for an individual, but...” this wouldn't be my first choice for a hotel in New York City.
Pluses:
The staff was very good; friendly and genuine.
The location was incredible, less than a block from the 59th Street/Columbus Circle subway station. Just a few steps beyond that is Central Park.
Minuses:
Yes, the rooms are incredibly small, even for New York.
Everything is very, very dark. It got a little depressing after a while.
I should note that I was at the Hudson through Priceline. I paid $160 a night for a standard room, which was close to half of the rack rate during my visit.
I arrived late Friday night. Thanks to googlemaps, I knew what to look for, as the front of the hotel has no name or number showing (I was walking; if you were in a cab or car service, this wouldn't be a problem). The big yellow window across the width of the entire hotel made it pretty easy to find. The lobby is up the famous yellow escalator. It is quite amazing, with the moss or ivy growing across the ceiling. Unfortunately, it is directly next to the Hudson Lounge, with no wall in between. The music from the lounge made it necessary to literally shout with the woman at the front desk as I checked in. She would shout a question, and I would shout my answer. Not exactly a tranquil way to check in.
My room was on the 12th floor, so the noise from the lounge was not an issue. I was next to the service elevators and stairs (a result of reserving through Priceline?), but I was not bothered by noise from those, either. 
I've stayed as some hotels with really small rooms, but I think this is the smallest room I have ever seen. The entire room is 150 square feet; there are large mirrors on both sides of the room to give the illusion of more space. There was really no place to put my suitcase; when I put it on the floor, it made it very difficult to walk around the bed. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was fine, but I am certainly glad I was not here on business. The room, even with all the lights on, was really dark. I tried to call the front desk to set up a wake up call, but the room was so dark I could not see which button on the phone was for wake up calls! I finally just punched 0 for the hotel operator. The ""desk"" in the room was so small, it really wasn't suited for any kind of work. Not to mention the lighting wasn't suited to working, either. I didn't have a computer with me, so I can't comment on the internet access in the room, for which there is a charge.
The head of the bed is up against the heater/air conditioner (as mentioned in other reviews). It was a bit loud, which didn't bother me, but I can see where light sleepers could be bothered. What I don't understand from other reviews are the mentions of the air blowing directly on people as they slept. At least in my room, the bed was lower than the fan unit, and the air was blowing straight up, so I don't understand how that could be a problem. The configuration may be different in other rooms, however. As to the air conditioner itself, it was not working very well the morning of my departure. I don't know, however, if that was my unit not working, or if it was the entire hotel. The outdoor temperature had been over 90 degrees for three straight days, so maybe the entire hotel was warm; I don't know.
The bathroom was larger than I had feared it might be, which was a relief. The products supplied were nice, and the shower worked well. I should point out there is a large window in the wall separating the bath from the bed area (to make the room seem larger?), with only a sheer curtain to block the view. If two people are sharing this room, they had better be really close! If you don't want to see your roommate using the bathroom, this probably isn't the hotel for you!
There were plenty of elevators, so I never had to wait long, but, oddly enough, they were very warm, uncomfortably so. Again, I don't know if the air conditioning was not working properly, but it was weird to get on the elevator and get hit with a blast of hot air.
I didn't visit any of the bars or the Hudson Cafeteria, so I can't speak to any of them. I was planning on grabbing a quick breakfast Monday morning at the Cafeteria, but the line was down the hallway, and I didn't have time to wait, so maybe next time.
As I didn't have a computer with me, I was planning on using the business center to quickly check email once or twice a day. There is absolutely no mention of it on the website, but there is a charge to use the computers: $6.95 for fifteen minutes. On the plus side, if you want to check in for any air travel online, there is no charge to do that; the computers are set up to allow that without having to purchase time, which is a good thing.
To summarize, I would consider staying here in the future if I was visiting on my own, and could get a good deal. I would not pay full price for this hotel, and I definitely would not stay here with my wife, unless I got a larger room. But I should reiterate, the staff was wonderful. I had a lovely chat with the doorman as I waited for my car to pick me up. He had to be hot, and he was very busy, but he still chatted with me as he worked, which he didn't need to do, and I thought spoke to the effort the staff makes to please the guests.

"“Great location, small rooms” The hotel is well located near Columbus Circle. The rooms are really REALLY small, we had two large suitcases and didn't have place for us to walk. Since most people use cell phones, I think the hotel recycled the old phone booths that no one uses into bathrooms...REALLY small.

"“Ridiculously small, with problems” I stayed at the Hudson in early May 2008 while in town for a wedding - I was looking for a reasonably priced hotel close to where the wedding was being held. Because comfort is more important to me than hip design, I usually shy away from ultra-hip hotels like the Hudson as I have generally found that form rules over function (and comfort), but the price was right so I went with it. My mistake.
The hotel is indeed as hip as its billing - beautiful modern decor in the lobby and a happening bar scene. There's a lovely terrace on one of the top floors with a great view. So what's wrong, you ask? THE ROOMS. The room was the smallest I have ever stayed in - barely a foot of room on any side of the bed, no closet or drawer space, you could barely move in the bathroom, no counter space, and two people must squish past each other just to enter the room...it was absolutely ridiculous. The only decent thing was that the bed was comfortable. Now, we were there to see the sites in NYC and didn't expect to spend much time in the room, but the time we did spend in it was uncomfortable, frustrating and stressful.
And to top it off, the hot water went out when I was in the middle of my shower, getting ready for the wedding. My boyfriend called the front desk and they said they couldn't do anything. After 15 mins. of shivering in the shower, I finally asked my boyfriend to give me a bottle of water, and used that to get the suds off me. About 15 mins. later, maintenance showed up, but of course the immediate trauma was over so nothing for them to do. By the next day, water was fixed.
In my opinion, the only reason to stay at the Hudson is to be able to easily get into their hip bar/clubs, but to me, that's not worth the discomfort of staying there.",mmminla,2008-05-01,223023,2008-06-11,False,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Best for Munchkins and Contortionists” As others have said the rooms are cramped. The beds are very low and there is very little room to change clothes etc. Be aware that the bathrooms are very small for most people. Make that VERY SMALL. It was exactly 10"" from the front of the toilet to the wall and you had to step around/over it plus dodge the hair dryer hung on the wall to enter the shower. For a 6'person to sit on the toilet required one knee inside the shower and one knee outside the door.

"“Worst hotel I ever stayed in.” We stayed here on our honeymoon. We were traveling for two months and stayed here as our last location. We had booked through Trailfinders. We were expecting small as its newyork. I have been to newyork twice before but this was the smallest room ever. This was ok but there was an airconditioning duct outside the window blowing at full blast.
 I went to reception to complain and request a new room but the attitude of the staff was horrendous. They actually offered me earplugs! We could believe they were letting this room with the noise
I then spoke to the ""manager"" who actually had the neck to say he had stayed there on a double shift and could sleep ok. I dont think he would have paid full price though. They said the hotel was fully booked (on a wednesday) and that there sister hotel were also booked out. The moved us to a ""suite"" the next day suite meaning slightly bigger room with an office desk wedged against the wall. 
Howeve the staff attitude completely ruined our experience so we moved out the next day despite having already paid in full.

"“Very Satisfactory Stay” My son and I stayed at the Hudson this past weekend, and I have to say that I was worried after reading the reviews. Overall, though, it was a very satisfactory stay.
I got the room through Priceline for $180 per night. However, when I emailed the hotel to request a room with two beds, I was told that I'd have to upgrade which would cost an additional $90 per night. That was a negative, but I chalk it up to Priceline's policies, not the hotel's. Priceline obviously isn't for people who need a specific type of hotel room configuration. 
Pluses:
1. The room, number 1109, was very clean and plenty big enough for the two of us.
2. The beds were comfy, if a bit low to the ground, with nice, squishy pillows.
3. The shower had incredible water pressure, as did the toilet.
4. The air conditioner worked like a dream, which was important during the 90+ degree weather that we experienced.
5. The staff that we encountered was friendly and helpful. I especially liked that there was someone checking for room keys before you could get on the elevators to go up to your room.
Minuses:
1. There were very few outlets in the room, and the ones I found were in inconvenient locations.
2. The lighting was minimal, especially if you wanted to read at night.
3. No towel racks in the bathroom, so even if you wanted to use your towels again, there was no place to hang them to dry.
4. Dark hallways
5. No name or address numbers on the front of the building...I just thought that was strange.
Overall, our stay was very satisfactory. The hotel is located across the street from a subway station, but we walked the 16 blocks to Times Square with no problem. Also, there are several nice coffee shops nearby that are open 24 hours. We especially liked the Flame Diner on the corner of 9th and 58th.
I don't think I'd pay full price to stay here, but if I got a good deal, I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. The hotel is a little trendy for my tastes, but it is an attractive, convenient place to stay.",TeachinNV,2008-06-01,223023,2008-06-10,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Classy Coziness” We got our room on pricline for a fraction of the asking price for a one nights stay. I would have never paid full price for this room, but we had a great time enjoying many aspects of the hotel.

We also ate at the restaruant, Hudson Cafeteria which was delicious and had a drink in the Library (pricey, but what in NYC isn't).",rylly,2007-10-01,223023,2008-06-05,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Small, expensive, dark” I was traveling with my husband and his parents. We booked this hotel via Priceline and clearly stated that there were 4 people travelling. As my husband and I checked into the Hudson, we were surprised because we were only given a room with single double bed (smaller than queen). We had to pay extra $90 for upgrade in addition to the price we already paid to Priceline. 
PRO:
Location. Close to Columbus Cir.
CON:
1. The room was small
2. Hallway was dark, so was the bathroom
3. The AC was badly positioned behind one of the beds and it blasted air the whole night directly to us. Our other option was to turn the AC completely off :(
4. Hidden charges (see story below)
My husband made a phone call to Priceline 800# using the phone in our room to complain and guess what, the hotell charged us CONNECTION FEE. Beware of hidden charges from this hotel. When we asked the front desk why there is no note on the phone warning us about the connection fee, the receptionist said: ""oh, it is in the manual in the drawer""

"“I HEART HUDSON” Me and my boyfriend's (20-somethings) first time in NYC and we decided to do it in style and stay at the Hudon Hotel on West 58th. 
Its a great location, right beside Columbus Circle and just on the South West corner of Central Park (where all the buggies line up to offer you a ride). 
The Hotel is essentially a nightclub. There were people standing outside (smokers) as we rocked up in our cab on the first evening and as we went up the illuminated yellow escalotors into the lobby, house music pumped throughout. Very fun atmosphere and fabulous music!. 
The lobby is a glorified conservatory - there is ivy covering the ceiling and the reception desk runs along the back wall. The staff were very friendly (although had to wait about 40 mins for our luggage to be brought up to our room once we had checked in). 
Be warned! Everything is very dim-lit in this place! (a common theme in NY it seems). Our room was on the top floor. We had a deluxe room (basically 2 double beds and a bathroom), Do not expect to have much space, we paid top dollar to have this room as we had heard that the other rooms in this hotel (and everywhere else in NYC are teeny tiny). It was definately worth spending that bit extra. Lovely soft linen, comfortable beds, lots of mirrors but so so so dark. The bathroom was basic. It was jazzed up by the modern sink but the shower was aged and needed a re-vamp. But the water pressure was good and it was clean and thats what counts. 
We could hear quite alot of noise from the room next door at night. People who had obviously spent their evening in the bar downstairs and had come up to carry on their drinking. Not great but it was ok. 
We did wonder why everyhting (even in the corridors) was so dark and we concluded that it was a good mask for the peeling paintwork and pretty drab corridor decor. But the rest of the hotel and the City make up for the couple of bad points this palce has.
We didnt drink grab a drink at the bar as there were so many other places we wanted to hit in Manhattan, but it looked great and was heaving on Friday and Saturday night. Great music also!
The terrace bar looked very lovely but was just thatt little bit too cold to sit out while we were there. 
The Hudson was a great place to stay. It is very cool and had alot to offer. Very New York. We would definately stay there again.",sunpeople29,2008-04-01,223023,2008-06-02,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Loved the hudson hotel” We just returned from a long weekend in NYC. I was extremely nervous at staying in this hotel because of all the bad reviews.
We really enjoyed the Hudson Hotel. The location was excellent one block away from central park. The hotel staff were wonderful. We arrived a few hours before check in but were able to pre check in 
(which I encourage) and they were able to hold our bag so we didn't have to carry in all around. The hotel lobby was dark but it was very charming. I had also read about a club which was very loud. At night there were a lot of people hanging around but I didn't hear a thing in our room, we stayed on the eleventh floor. There was a guy at the elevator asking to see our room key which I thought was great so that way you don't have people roaming around the hotel. The rooms are very clean but are on the smaller side only I think 150 sq ft. I was traveling with my husband and our 11 month old son so we also in addition to our double bed had a small crib in our room and we were able to moved around just fine. The only thing that I could find fault with was the air conditioning did work but it just wasn't cool enough.

"“Worst. Hotel. Ever.” I'm a pretty easy-going guy, with a high tolerance for drama. But this hotel just took the cake. In the span of 3 short days, this hotel managed to:
1) Screw up my reservation even though I had called hours before to confirm.
2) Have no hot water one morning.
3) Have no working elevators for an entire day.
4) Accidentally double-lock my room and not tell me on the day when the elevators weren't working, making me walk up several flights of stairs four times before realizing this.
5) Have room service not show up twice.
6) Fail to give me rooms keys that worked after being used more than once.
Now, maybe these are just flukes, and these mechanical errors don't happen very often. But even aside from these, there's alot to detract from the place. 
1) The rooms are TINY.
2) It's dark all the way through.
3) I'm all for clubbing, but having the club essentially in the lobby, there to greet you after a long day of traveling, isn't my style.
4) Did I mention how tiny and amenity-free the rooms are?

"“Bad Place” The worst hotel experience that I have ever had!!!! I arrived late, checked in, and went to the bar for a drink. After one or two drinks, I went to my room, got undressed, and climbed into bed. However, when I climbed into bed, I discovered that the bed was WET!!! It was VERY WET!!!! I have now idea what the liquid was, or where it came from. I looked for broken pipes, or a spilled glass and found nothing. I quickly took a shower to wash the ""wetness"" off of me, and called the front desk...There was no answer....I called the manager's office... no answer...I called housekeeping....no answer.... I called the operator.... and still no answer. After about 15 minutes of calling various numbers, and never reaching anyone, I dressed again and went downstairs to the front desk. The clerk was playing some sort of pocket video game. When I told him about my WET bed, he told me to, ""Please step away from the front desk and that he was feeling claustrophobic."" He refused to give me a different room, and said that he would send housekeeping to the room to fix it. 1 1/2 hours later someone shows up and flips the mattress and changes the bedding. However, the bed was still wet. I had the cleaning lady bring me around 20 towels and laid them across the bed to shield me from the ""WET"". 
The room was also the absolute smallest room that I have ever stayed in. There is no way that it was worth the money. I will NEVER return to this hotel.",tshissler,2007-04-01,223023,2008-05-15,False,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“The Hudson is a Hidden Jewel” My fiance & I were on a business trip and decided to stay an extra night to have some fun in the city. We fell in love with the Morgan Hotel Group after staying at the Mondrian in LA in 2004, so we decided to book at one of their hotels in New York. Being we weren't going to have much time at the hotel, we booked at the least expensive of the three hotels in the city. When we first pulled up in the taxi there were no signs with the name of the hotel but we knew we were there because of the muffled green lighting coming from the front windows. This was definitely a Morgan Group Hotel. After checking our bags we were sent through the doors and directly up an escalator. When we reached the top we had to take a second look as it almost felt as if we were outside. The walls and ceiling were covered in green moss. We walked up to the counter and for some reason the first thing I felt to ask was about the history of the building. The building it self just had a strong presence as if you knew something special had happened there. The woman at the front desk explained that it was originally a woman's dormatory and then years later was actually the filming location for Sesame Street of all things! 
Walking up to our room we definitely recognized the ""dormatory"" part of it with the dark narrow hallways. And I have to admit I initially had mixed feelings when I walked into the room. I knew it was going to be small, but this room was tiny. Of course I though wow - $260 doesn't get you much in NYC! But as I settled down and really looked around I realized how well they used the space that was there to make it feel modern and sexy. A lot of it was in the lighting but they knew what they were doing and I suddenly liked it. And how much time to do spend in your room in NYC anyway?
We first went down the Cafeteria (which I am told was one of the Sesame Street shooting locations) and had some drinks and appetizers. They did an excellent job with this restaurant preserving the historical feel while embracing modern ambiance. The food was minimal but excellent and the mixed drink selection made me want to stay all night. 
But we left and went on to the live music/bar/dance area. I thought it was pretty funny that they kept the reserved signs on the premium tables even though no one had rented them, so I decided to sit down. No one seemed to care, except my fiance of course!
After that we went on to the Library which was one of my favorite parts of the hotel. An old traditional library complete with the rolling ladders to climb up and grab a book. We sat down in some very cozy chairs and I decided to get us a couple glasses of champagne (since I am a sucker for the stuff and they had six bottles on ice just sitting there waiting to be consumed!) Well, I have to admit I can be a bit of a snob at times and yes I do appreciate the finer things in life, but happened next shocked the hell out of me. I asked for two GLASSES of champagne (and believe me, they were not extra large or anything). The bartender said something that sounded like ""fifteen"" so at first I thought , wow - what a bargain for NYC! Until of course handed him a twenty, about to say keep the change, and he leaned over and said ""No, I said FIFTY."" Yes, fifty, as in 5-0 for two tiny glasses of what was probably $10 champagne. Well, my wow-I-got-a-bargain smile quickly turned into an embarrassed grin as I took my $20 back and handed him my credit card! What was I supposed to do? Say nevermind? Ya, right - I'm supposd to ne a snob! I don't think I mentioned to my fiance how much the champagne I bought us cost, but I know I made him sit there until we finished every last drop!
In a nut shell, this is definitely a place to stay if you are in the city and you want to stay somewhere chic yet you don't want to spend your retirement (just stay away from the champagne!)

"“Cool Hotel” The Hudson is a very cool/funky hotel and located near the park (although, I didn't get to check out the surround area as I was there for business and had a full day scheduled). 
The hotel bars looked pretty nice (nothing great but nice) but the clientelle was spectacular (very attractive women everywhere). Apparently, there's a nice courtyard too but unfortunately, it was under construction during my stay. 
The rooms are incredibly small. I thought hotel rooms in Hong Kong were small.... Having said that, it was well spaced out all things considering. There was literally room to fit a bed, a very small table and that was pretty well it. Not much room around the edges of the bed. The bathroom was very tight too. I'm at best an average sized guy (probably less than average) and I just fit to sit on the toilent with my knees touching the otherside of the wall (I always wondered what if I was a bigger or taller person??). 
Still, this is NY we're talking and in a good spot so there has to be a trade off.

"“Run-down, not ""chic""” I would not recommend this property to anyone who likes clean, comfortable rooms, particularly anyone who isn't into clubbing since the main attraction at this property seems tobe the loud, busy bar attached to the lobby and attracts a lot of club-going type people.
Without much prodding, many staff I spoke to on-site agree that the property is really not being managed well. Both my room and my friend's room were dirty - hair on the bathroom floor, stains on the (tiny) carpet square in the (dark, tiny) closet. They had to bring a full-sized lamp and put it in the closet so I could see to operate my tiny table-top sized ironing board. If you stay here, don't bring anything that requires ironing as the tiny board is impossible. Noise from pipes/heat at night (loud clanging when coming on), bed squeaked like a flophouse every time I turned over. The room smelled of stale smoke and the hallways smell. Ripped, worn furniture. Water glass stains on the table. Black smudges on the walls. And the restaurant waiters are too ""cool"" to write down your order but alas, also too cool to remember the choices you made when ordering your meal when they set down the wrong thing in front of you. My friend had no water one morning and was told at ""certain times"" there is just no water, especially on higher floors.

"“DARK” Very trendy hotel, almost too cool for it's own good! Our double twin room was ok size-wise, but no storage for clothes, no wardrobe or chest of drawers meant living out of a suitcase. And why does it have to be SO DARK?? All the lighting is so dim it's impossible to see to get dressed at night, you have to be careful walking around because you can't see your feet!
Position is excellent for 5th Avenue shopping, Central Park etc.
My 19 year-old daughter loved it and didn't mind the above inconveniences. Staff were friendly and helpful.

"“2+ star masquerading as a 4” First - the location is great. Right near the south end of Central park and walking distance to the Broadway Theaters (12 blocks more or less). and there is a lovely deck where you can enjoy the air when the weather is good. This is not a terrible hotel but from what I was led to believe this was supposed to be a 4 star property. The rooms are TINY. No place to put your clothes (no drawers, one tiny shelf) a 12 inch cheap TV, broken alarm clock, a toilet that overflowed and no tub. I also had trouble with my wi-fi but the bill was corrected by the front desk on check out. The design is best described as Ikea. The whole place reminded me of a HGTV design show where they go in and remodel on a budget. At first it looks great, but after a closer exam you see how cheap it all is.

What a good decision that was, the lobby is amazing, staff are so attentative, 3 amazing bars including a garden bar and the food in the restaurant was second to none! Only critisism would be the standard double room is absolutely tiny, i mean tiny (probably maximimum 1 foot space between the bed and wall around it)!

"“Loved This Hotel” I was very worried about staying at the Hudson after reviews I had read, to the point of investigating alternative hotels but decided as there was 10 of us and we were only booked in for 4 nights we could put up with it. The hotel was easy to find and in a fantastic position. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the rooms were small but very clean and comfortable. My girlfriend and I and our friends all loved the hotel and when our friends daughters asked to be moved to be near their parents room they were moved immediatly with no fuss.
We could not fault the hotel, yes the rooms are small but you are advised of this when booking and I am over 6ft and found it very comfortable.
I really left feeling some people must moan about anything not to like it here. I travel regularly and stay in beautiful hotels all around the world and thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. I did not go to NY to sit in my room. Will definatly stay here again.

"“If you just need a room to change, shower, and sleep...” ...then the Hudson is for you! The rooms are minimal and very small so I would recommend this hotel to anyone who will be out and about for nearly all the time during a stay in New York. The lobby and check in areas are beautifully decorated in a avante garde sort of way. I hear the bar is the place to be on weekend evenings.
What I liked about this hotel was the decor and the location near Columbus Circle, Central Park, Time Warner Building, Fordham Law School, the subway, and soon to be opening Pinkberry which are all within a three block radius. The value factor was definitely there for me considering we paid less than an average Manhattan hotel would charge. If you can book a room here for under $250 (after taxes/fees), I'd say go for it.
Although I liked the general decor of the common areas, I think they skimped out on the rooms' decor and the hallways between rooms are grey, dark, and depressing. Just my opinion though.
Overall, I'd stay here again only because it has value, the location is great, and I don't really spend much time enjoying hotel rooms when I'm in New York anyway.",madelynyeung,2008-02-01,223023,2008-04-08,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Good for people watching” Booked for one night - partly because I was really intrigued. My adolescent sons thought it was a fantastically cool hotel. I am still unsure how I feel - other than it was a really good place to observe trendy people posing!
Reception - OK. Concierge services - OK. Staff at breakfast - clearly thought we weren't the type of people they wanted in their breakfast room! 
We'd booked one deluxe king and one deluxe double - which were actually a decent size (for New York) - and had some closet space. However, my room, which was on the corner of the building was quite noisy - but at night it almost became white noise and therefore didn't disturb my sleep. The bed was very comfortable. The bathrooms though are miniscule - but with very nice products.
I really hated the corridors and if I had been on my own I would have felt very nervous. They are so dark - and there are so many hidden corners - that I felt really uncomfortable and unsafe.

"“'Three cousins from Massachusetts'-loved The Hudson” Three of us stayed in one room for one evening. Yes, it was extremely tight and luckily none of us are large people! The room was fantastic, but very small. The experience was outstanding from locating the hotel along the street to the rooftop garden. Basically, we were there for an overnight, so didn't spend much time in the hotel/room. We purchased a bottle of wine (outside of the hotel) and enjoyed that in the lobby. The following morning, we bought our lunch at Whole Foods, which is within walking distance and enjoyed it at the rooftop garden. 
My cousins and I plan a trip every year for an overnight and we have been pleased with the hotels each time. I've made reservations (via Hotwire) for my daughter and myself and as luck would have it, it will be at The Hudson.

The HDTV looked pretty but I had to call down repeatedly, over the course of two days, to get someone to come fix it. The day I left, they turned off water to my room (without warning me first) at 8 am, which seems to me to be a perfectly normal time to be wanting to shower.

"“Only Okay” For a hotel which boasts to be a hotel where the 'surfer dude' can rub shoulders with the politician I was amazed that after the price of the small room rising from $269 to over $300 with (unavoidable) taxes the hotel want to 'hold' a further $150 dollars a night for incidentals, and when we told the hotel staff we had no credit card and were paying cash and willing to pay up front, we were still told we would have to pay the $750 up front in cash, and have it refunded, hardly suitable when our budget for NYC for the 5 days was around $1500. Although this was eventually resolved it was embarrassing and disappointing having this debate at reception. For a hotel we heard referred to as 'the hotel with no sign' maybe a sign out front saying ‘if you're not rich, we don't want you’ would suffice.
Once in our room, we were relieved to find it was clean and practical, yes it was small but we had expected that. 
With the exception of the incident at reception all staff were pleasant and helpful, especially concierge and front door staff.

"“Hell at the Hudson” Booked 3 nights at the Hudson for wifes birthday celebration in March 2008
Also had 2 friends with us who booked in for same stay.
Rooms very very small, corridors very dimly lit, difficult to find lifts and stairs, really concerned what would happed in event of fire , would be very difficult to find fire escape.Strange odour in corridors. Booked queen sized beds but length so small my friend who is 6'3'' had legs sticking out the end of bed.These are definitely not american queen size.
Biggest problem though was the noise. Had corner room on floor 7. Impossible to sleep due to constant traffic noise and total lack of double glazing.
For 310$ plus tax this was the worst value for money and the most uncomfortable, noisiest room I have ever stayed in.
We complained and got a move to Morgans on Madison Ave.

"“Spend more money on the actual room!” I'm pretty low maintenance, and I was excited to stay in this hotel given the Phillip Starck designs. However, I was disappointed. The room was spotless, which was great, and I didn't mind the size or the size of the bathroom--I found the bathroom fairly average sized, actually.
But no amount of designer touches can hide the fact that this is an OLD hotel, and it seems that they didn't spend much of the budgegt on improving the room or on the actual bed! My bed was literally poking me with springs--it looked like a pretty low end and OLD hotel mattress. I'm a dead-to-the-world type sleeper and was awoken several times with the clunks of the heater (conveniently placed at your headboard) and the clunks of the pipes throughout the night. I also had to stuff a towel in the 3 millimeter crack between the window and the wall so that the draft blowing in didn't get me sick. 
It's a great location, and like I said, I'm pretty low maintenance--so if it's clean and convenient, I'm pretty happy. However, the old and noisy sleeping situation wasn't great.

"“Great for Young People” Stayed for four nights with a friend last weekend. We are both 23 year old females and I booked this hotel after reading many reviews so I knew what to expect. 
One thing I don't understand from other reviewers is the difficulty finding the place. It's a large cement block with a green escalator and lights on the outside. It's a pretty distinct property. All the staff was really friendly and helpful (surprisingly so). 
Our room was very small but it was expected. We paid $260 a night and booked through the hotel's website where there is a photo, description, and square footage given. The room was really nice though and very comfortable. I will say the bathrooms are very small and while it was fine for us, it would be a tight squeeze for some one larger (men).
What really made the hotel great for us though was the Hudson Bar downstairs. It was great being able to go drink and dance and not worry about having to take a taxi back or walk, etc. The DJ wasn't the greatest but I was pleasantly surprised at how packed it was all four nights we were there. Note though, the music is very loud and I could faintly hear it from our room with the window open.

"“Great lobby, tired hotel, miniscule rooms” The Hudson offers decent value for New York hotels. The location is immaculate and lobby and main public areas are stunning. The moment you step in the very slow elevators you go back to the '70s. The halls are dimly lit, decorated in dark brown, adding to the general darkness. 
The rooms are an amazing feat in cramming stuff in minimal space. The bed is the largest object in the room by far. The headboard is the A/C - which ruins your night sleep. There is a tiny plastic desk and chair to work on and a designer bathroom - shower stall and sink - also, very tight.

"“Small, clean & funky.” The room is small, but the worst thing was that there was no chest of drawers where to put our stuff. My husband and I couldn't fit all of our clothes on 6 hangers. So we had to live out of our suitcases the whole time. The shower curtain was too short and after one of us took a shower, water was spilled everywhere. The bathroom door didn't stay opened, it kept closing on us which was really annoying. But we were lucky to have a bathroom door, people on the 9th floor didn't have that. There was no real light, only small lamps by the bed and some funky light behind the bed. When we entered the room late at night, we had to walk all the way to the bed to turn on the little lamps. Some people from our group complained about the noisy heating system. The heater was making clunky noises and kept waking them up. They stayed on the 9th floor. We stayed on the 17th floor and didn't have this problem. The cleaning staff was very friendly, they kept our room very clean. The bar was cool. The phone in our room wasn't working properly, the TV was way too small and old for such a funky hotel. For such small rooms, they should install flat screens on the walls. We paid $10 for 24hr internet connection in our room, but the connection was very slow! There's a European bakery next door, Starbucks, CVS, a supermarket, an Irish pub and sushi place.

Yes the lobby is FULL of posers who wouldn't last a week if their trust funds dried up or Wall Street tumbled (even farther). Yes, the room was tiny and the halls were dark. The hotels was DESIGNED to be this way and if you let yourself embrace the place you might have an enjoyable stay - I did! The Hudson is NOt your average hotel - every other one in New York is, so go to one of them if you want polyester spreads and big old tubs to splash around in.

"“No Hot Water” We booked this on Priceline, bidding on a 3-star hotel at $160/night, for two nights over a weekend in March. 
We did get upgraded to a ""double delux"" room, which was perfectly adequate in terms of size. (So we did not have the problem with the microscopic standard rooms.) Except for the lack of hot water and broken window (see below), the room was very comfortable.
There are some nice things about this hotel. It's cool in a shabby-chic way, and hopping on Friday/Saturday night. The front desk staff was very nice and courteous, and the rooms spotlessly clean. The location is great.
There is a glaring, awful problem with this hotel: NO HOT WATER!!! 
Apparently, the hot water heater is inadequate for the number of rooms, so except for one brief 5-minute window at approximately 1 p.m., the water was just barely above cold the entire time we were there. It wasn't even really lukewarm, so we had to take cold showers!
Also, our window latch was broken, so when there were high winds overnight, our window blew in all night (it was about 25 degrees out), and we finally had to prop chairs against it. Still, a draft got in all night. We didn't bother to change rooms because we were checking out the next morning and it was very late, and we didn't want to repack all our stuff.
And the prices for hotel breakfast are ridiculous. I expect inflated prices in NYC, but $8 for a single glass of orange juice (not fresh squeezed). $5 regular coffee??? $18 eggs? That is just silly. Breakfast was $70. (Tip: There is a Whole Foods with a buffet (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) right across the street in the Time Warner center.)
We got in at 11 pm at night so we also ate dinner at the Hudson...which was also expensive ($25-$35/entree, wines starting about $14/glass), but it seemed normal for NYC and the food was decent. Our dinner for two cost only a couple dollars more than breakfast!
Another problem - not the hotel's fault - is the fire station down the road. Apparently the local drivers of vehicles with sirens take pleasure in playing with the sirens during the day (making silly noises at each other), which is a pain if one is trying to nap or sleep in late.
Other than the lack of hot water, I would have been okay with this hotel at the price we paid. But for an allegedly 3-star hotel, one reasonably expects hot water...and this is an ongoing problem that Priceline has known about. Priceline (or any other bidding-type website) really should not be putting people here until the hot water problem is fixed.",RELJD,2008-03-01,223023,2008-03-10,False,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“The Twilight Zone” This was, by far, the strangest place I have ever stayed. I was first struck by the trendy (and cool) facade that lacked any indication that I was at the right place (no name on the building, no address on the door). I was told by a staff member that this was to increase curiosity and draw people in. Once I got in, I wanted nothing more than to get out.
Let me elaborate. I like to be pampered, but pampering I did not get. Instead, I got a tiny room with just inches between the wall and the bed. I got funky lights (decorated with nightmarish body parts) that worked only half the time. I got a hidden thermostat, requiring a secret trick to access (many thanks to the wonderful housekeeper who took pity on me while I was freezing and shared the secret). I got a television almost too small to see, that would not stay off. Really. I'd turn it off, and a few seconds later it would come back on. No one seemed to be able to fix it. I got a tiny bathroom with only a sheer curtain to separate it from the rest of the room (okay, there was a door, but there was no wall between it and the rest of the room. I had to close the shower curtain for privacy). I got some weird metal tray, which looked like a soap holder, sticking out of the wall, which injured me as I tried to walk past it (was it for a housekeeper's tip?). I got a tiny bedside table just big enough for a phone, and a little stool underneath it that I pulled out to use for my water glass. Nothing else would fit on it. I got a hallway that made me feel like I was on my way to my execution. I got no towel racks, save the little buttons sticking out of the wall. I got no ice bucket. I got no drawers. I got no blankets, until I called housekeeping. What I did get, however, was good service from the staff. They made my stay somewhat bearable.
The lobby is trendy and cool. The bars are okay, but overpriced and meat-markety (I truly thought I was going to be able to read in the library; much to my chagrin, it was just a trendy pub, albeit with hilarious photos of cows in stylish hats).
Overall, this place is just plain strange. It is uncomfortable and overpriced. Luckily, my friend and I had a good laugh at each new eccentricity we found.

"“Clean, comfy, inexpensive, modern.” I was on a weekend trip to NYC and the Hudson had a nice price for their small room ($219) and I was traveling alone. If there are two of you it would be better to spring for a larger room, but it is NYC and I expect the rooms to be tiny.
The room was very modern and most of all clean. The bed is extremely comfortable and all the comforts of home abound (stereo, TV, desk). The location is also great, I like to stay away from the hustle and this is a convenient spot on the UWS. The bar is also a great place to hang and although very pricey the breakfast I had was wonderful. Last but not least, excellent service from the staff; helpful and polite.
So I'm impressed with the hotel, especially for the price.
However, if you are a light sleeper you may have issues. The window blocked out little if any noise and the cold winds as well. No problem, so I turn on the heat and it works, but it makes strange noises that again may make it tough to sleep.
The bathroom is great, yet this shower curtain was like some sort of cheap window treatment. It just flows in the breeze and water leaks everywhere. 
It would also be nice if people in other rooms could realize that you can close the door gently as opposed to letting it slam as hard as possible.
I'm certainly not trying to bash, the overall experience for me was very good. But be sure to drink plenty or refill your xanax.",jaredw,2008-02-01,223023,2008-03-06,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Don't believe the hype” The rooms are cruise-ship small....almost laughable. Stayed there for business but found that it's really a party palace....great bar, if you're into that scene. The food is good but way over-priced, especially breakfast.

"“Trendy too far” We booked the Hudson through priceline because of the price, $105 for the night. 
The Good: The rooms were as described here, small but clean and small is fine since this was New York. The bathroom was clean with very nice toiletries. We had a queen size bed which was comfortable. The staff was extremely nice and the location was perfect. Out the door to the left was a great little place to eat and out the door to the right was the subway station.
The Bad: The rooms and hallways are so dark that we (both lawyers) came up with this saying... ""They are one light bulb away from a negligence suit"". Yep.. it was that dark. We wanted to read in our room but we didn't have a normal white light. We had a blue light, a green light, and some lights with creepy faces on it. I've included some photos of the room and the lights.
Overall, I would stay here again for the location. However.. I wish they would just put in a few lights!",thegeekboy,2008-02-01,223023,2008-03-05,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“A Manhattan ""Boatel""” Ever stayed in a small cabin on a cruise ship? Or a decent boatel in Amsterdam? Then you'll understand the Hudson. The rooms are tight, the bathrooms are tighter. But it's all there: nice bed/bedding, full bath/shower with fine toiletries, space for luggage, even a little TV tucked away in a built-in closet. Everything people have written about the room sizes is true, but if you get this place at an off price, you can't really complain about any of it. (Full price is a different story).
Make sure you know where you're going. As written in other reviews, there is no signage (odd, but oddly hip, I suppose).
There are (for Manhattan) reasonably priced munchies and drinks available from vending machines on each floor. There are 5 or 6 elevators, which is not quite enough at peak times, so allow extra in-out time during the a.m. rush.
Once you leave the room, you're aboard a very funky (and pricey) cruise ship. The public spaces are an experience in themselves. If your name is Deiter, and you dress in black, and you're under 35, you'll love this place. If you're not , you might love it anyway. There are probably 1,000 guests there on any given night and they are truly an eclectic bunch. The bar/disco is intentionally retro chic, so you'll find everyone from 20s to 60s hanging out there, dancing and having a good time (too loud for my preference, but to each his/her own).
As for location, you are half an avenue block from the Columbus Circle subway station, where you can catch at least a half dozen different routes to various points in Manhattan. Also, you are at the edge of the Upper West Side, a residential area where dining is much more affordable than mid-town. So, take a walk up Amsterdam or Columbus Avenue to the 70s or 80s and you'll find some better meal deals than you'll find walking south.

"“Emperor's New Clothes.....” Surely the only reason to stay here is coz of the Stark connection....but it's just not worth it. The room's are ridiculously small.

I was upgraded, FOR NO MONEY AT ALL, to a room on the 20th floor. It was a suite. Nice living room. HUGE MARBLE BATHROOM. Nicely decorated bedroom with real furniture, as in an antique looking armoire. Everything was tasteful and beautiful. And, the best feature, was the terrace. A good sized terrace, entered from the bedroom, with iron railings all around, with a great view of the city streets below. It even had wrought iron furniture to sit with a glass of wine and enjoy the view. When you consider what I paid and that this hotel is a short walk from Grand Central, it could not be beat. I will definitely return. If you go, make sure you ask for the terrace rooms. I have stayed in NYC many times so I know what you get for your money.

"“very small but sensational experiance” pulling up after a long haul flight from australia - our driver brought us to a building with flames on the outside walls, a bright green door way and absolutely no sign to tell us we were at the hotel. Asking the driver ""how do people know its here"" he replied, ""if you dont know where the hudson is you shouldnt be here"" very much the case.
The entry to the lobby is very impressive and the reception area is amazing - dark, but amazing. The Hudson bar - a must do - was pumping and it gave a very good first impression.
The check in guy warned us of the room size - however nothing could really prepare you for how small it was. 
Walking into the room, i laughed at the size, however it was all part of the hudsons charm. Tip to travellors - if you doing a massive shopping spree in NYC, dont stay in the standard rooms as there is no space to store your purchases.
I highly recommend this hotel and the bar and everything else that goes with it, purely for the experiance. the staff were very friendly and helpful, the patrons on the other hand were rude and arrogant, but never mind.
Another tip - dont get to drunk in the hudson bar as the hallways are very very dim and easy to walk into things.
Highly recommend the hudson lemonade from the bar - it has a great kick. and if you go in the summer time spend some time on the roof top terrace - absolutely amazing!",ctaylor81,2007-09-01,223023,2008-02-25,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Small rooms, Good location” Stayed here the first week of February on business. The best aspects of this hotel: 1.) Location 2.) Common Areas.
There is a great lobby and a couple of happening hotel bars. The hotel is situated near the Columbus Circle Mall, as well as several restaurants, starbucks, little markets and pharmacies. The staff was also very friendly.
The rooms are small. If you've got a queen size bed, the width of your room will be the width of the bed plus one foot on either side (I had the 150 sq. ft. room). My colleagues complained that when they sat on the toilet, their knees touched the wall (they're about 6 ft tall). As I'm only 5'5"", I didn't have this problem. 
If you are looking to relax in your hotel room, this may not be the place for you. The room is small and the t.v is about 9"" and shoved into the closet.

"“It all depends of the room” I am just back from spending 4 nights at the Hudson. The reception area is indeed very impressive although I was slightly put off by the fact I had to shout to check-in as the bar was in full swing. I did not like my room at all. It was very small (not a problem per se) but also uncomfortable, noisy and badly equipped for the money (no bathrobe, slippers or umbrella). It was noisy (traffic) and showing signs of aging. After speaking to various members of staff (some pleasant, some not), I managed to be upgraded to a double queen room on the 17th floor facing the courtyard and I was very happy. Much quieter, much larger `and much more comfortable.
The best thing for me was breakfast which is in a very pleasant room. I probably won't stay here again though.",Nominoette,2008-02-01,223023,2008-02-16,False,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Chic” Gorgeous design, love the bar, sexy reception area. Looks like they have the most romantic patio outside but not we were there is Dec so it was not for use. 
Rooms are toooooooo small, never seen a room the same width of a bed and that is not an exaggeration. Perfect for a bus traveler or couples in their honeymoon. Forget about spending time in room or ordering room service as the rooms are too small for that but in NY you want to get out and experience the city anyway.

"“Pleasantly surprised” After we booked this hotel as a last minute deal we read some tripadvisor reviews and thought we had made a mistake! However -we arrived last week and were very relieved and pleasantly surprised! The hotel is in a good position for exploring - close to Central Park, the Times Warner Centre and the subway - we walked to Times Square in just 15 mins. Check in was efficient and the staff couldn't have been more curteous and helpful throughout our stay. We had already decided to upgarde our room to a deluxe - this made it a regular size with a queen bed, a decent bathroom, hanging space but no drawers. Tv was reasonable size but a bit of a dinosuar, maybe they will change to plasma which would complement the decor better. We slept well - no noise at night (4th floor) apart from the heating kicking in - it was minus 11c!!! outside. The room was spotlessly clean and serviced every day without a problem. The concierge service was good - checked us in on-line, and no charge for a late check out. If you have booked the Hudson and are concerned by some peoples reviews - don't be! For us the only things missing were a big bathtub to warm up in after a cold day and a spa /pool but then not many hotels in the city offer that!",ka_bee,2008-02-01,223023,2008-02-15,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

But if you are just using it as a place to rest your head at night, it's fine.

The service was top notch and the bar was pretty slick. The location is terrific and is in walking distance to Central Park. The one negative comment that I have is that the hallways are pretty dim which is fine if you are sober;) Other than that this is a fab place for young couples and singles.

"“overpriced hudson” The Hudson Hotel is an alright hotel but definitley has some work to do. First of all, you have no idea where it is because it has no signage outside. I had to drive by the hotel three times to finally realize it was right there. Second, the hotel has some nice modern decor, but the rooms are so small especially for a man my size. I'm 6' 2"" athletic build and the bathroom was like a coffin for me. I had trouble drying myself in the tiniest hotel bathroom I'v ever been in. Plus the bed was so low that I needed a cane to help me up. Finally, the hotel had no noise protection for all the cars that drive by in NYC and the tv was 13"" big. Are you kidding me?

"“Happy Hudson” During the first weekend of February My wife and I decided to take a weekend and enjoy NYC, we had previously stayed at Royalton in NY, their sister property but we wanted to try Hudson as it was just the two of us and not our daughter. 
We arrived at the hotel extemly late after a 5 hour delay and were welcomed with a warm and friendly smile by the Front Desk Agent. As he made small talk we proceeded with the check in process and he explained that we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite. We were very happy with that after hearing that the standard rooms are rather small. When we got to the room were were suprised to see how much they did with the space. The living room was off the foyer and their was a long hallway leading to the bedroom and a very large walk in closet and very large bathroom. (only downside no tub). The design of the room is great with beautiful hardwood floors and wood walls, it gives it a very cabin like feel. They also are redoing their TV's as I was told, so if you are into that thing in Manhattan you will be excited to see a large flat screen in the living room and a 27"" in the bedroom. (but it is NYC, so why be stuck in the room.) As it had been an extremly long day we were off to bed and happy to notice that we did not hear any bar noise as previously mentioned. We were on the 8th floor.
The next day we woke up and were very happy to noitce that there are two Starbucks with in a stone's through of the hotel. Also their is a CVS and a grocery store where you can get what you need. I loved the fact that they had vending machine's on the floor and they were hidden behind a door that said ""Eat"" of ""Drink"" the prices were not bad either $2 door a soda is pretty cheap. 
We went out and enjoyed the city that day, we took the subway to SOHO and shopped and realized that we did like our hotel not in the middle of everything but rather a place to escape to. The subway is a block away and if that is not close enough for you, you have some issues. 
That evening we had a late night dinner in the Hudson Cafeteria and the food was great comfort food with an elegant twist. The bar was very inviting and the staff always made you feel welcome. My favorite was Library bar where you could sit infront of the Fire and enjoy a cocktail and a book. 
What I love about Morgans Hotel Groups property's is the attention to Detail and the amazing peices of furniture that they have in the rooms and the lobby. I went to the W union Square to see what all the hype is about. It looks like nothing more than a Westin with a couple of contemporary pecies from Pottery Barn. I would never stay at another hotel in NYC. Other than Royalton or Morgans, and I can not wait to see the new Mondrian they will be opening in SOHO.

There is no sign to indicate the door you are walking by is the entrance to the Hudson. We found the staff to be extremely friendly and efficient. When I asked what time we needed to check out, I was told noon, but then they offered to extend our check out to 2 PM without us even asking. Nice!!! The room was very small, but clean. The decor is over the top contemporary. The music on the elevators is annoying. There are many items in the room for purchase at outrageous prices. The bed was a bit low to the floor, but was comfortable. The heater was extremely noisy, making a good night's sleep difficult. The location is great. Very close to Central Park, and the Time/Warner shopping complex. We purchased our one night stay through Hotwire and got a bargain basement price.

The rooms are small but cleverly designed to fit all the essentials in and as we were there for sightseeing and shopping we were only in the room to sleep so the size was not an issue, the only fault with the room being there was no tea/coffee making facilities.

I had a normal sized bathroom but my co-worker was put in a room where the bathroom was so small your knees hit the wall while sitting on the toilet.

"“Trendy and Fabulous” My boyfriend and I decided to stay at the Hudson after relentless researching...and it was a perfect pick! I was a little wary after reading some of the reviews about the rooms being so tiny, and while they were rather small they were by no means unbearable. We were on the 19th floor with beautiful views of the city. The room itself was tiny, but we were comfortable. The bathroom was a decent size and the decor was stylish. 
The hotel lobby is absolutely beautiful and all of the staff were super friendly and attentive. We arrived early and were able to store our bags while we explored the city. There were afforable lots within a block of the hotel so parking was no problem.
The two bars in the hotel were beautiful! Especially the Hudson Bar. It was the place to be seen on Saturday night when we returned from the theatre, and it was pretty nice to not have to go very far for a great time. 
The hotel is ideally located in the city only a short walk to central park and Times Square and all the major sightseeing places (go to the Empire State Building at night for fantastic views and no lines!).

"“Tight squeeze” My company booked a block of rooms at the Hudson at $194.00 per night as part of a trade show rate. This is a very good price for NYC ,so no complaints here. The hotel location is fine, near Columbus Circle, shopping Central Park South...
The hotel is dark and trendy, reminding me of the W hotel chain.
Rooms are very small and the bathroom was the smallest I have ever been in. The shower has a connecting wall with the bed room made of glass with a gauzey curtain that can be pulled over.This can be either a very interesting feature or just weird.
The room was clean and made up every day when I arrived back in the evening. There are two bars, the more sedate Library and the loud one with the DJ. Beautiful people hang out at both. Be prepared, drinks are expensive, even for NYC.
There are many pubs and diners nearby that are more reasonable.
A previous reviewer had it right. This is may not be the place to satisfy the needs of either business people or old folks.

"“Happy Hudson” All public areas are stunning aesthetically, well kept and unique. Staff attentive and efficient. Room small but entirely perfectly formed, lovely bathroom products. It was a bit noisy with bizarre animated plumbing activity throughout the night! The bar came to life at night, really nice atmosphere, good tunes, pricey drinks but worth it for the environment. Library area impressive. Ate in cafeteria once, extremely quick service, good, plentiful food reasonably priced.

"“Not satisfied, will never go there again” I ordered the tickets from hotwire for two people.
Upon arriving we got a tiny tiny room with one single bed. This was seriously the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. The bed was too tiny for two people.
We complained, and all they could offer was a small discount for an upgraded room.
We took it, and then more problems!
There was no hot water(!) 
The first three days we had to call down to the reception every time to get hot water. Then they told us that we needed to let the water run for 10 minutes before talking a shower.
The room was always either too cold or too warm. The windows leaked cold air in, and it was VERY unpleasant to sleep there.
Last but not least, I made the mistake of checking out a day too early, and they didn't even let us know that I was checking out too early, or even asking why we are checking out earlier. They didnt refund the extra day either.
It might be that we were just very unlucky, but I am never going back there. Other than that, the hotel was nice, and the hotels bar was very good!",cash1981,2008-01-01,223023,2008-01-23,False,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“OK For the Location” I booked a trip to NYC over the MLK day weekend using Hotwire.com and blind purchased a four star hotel for $149.00/night. It turned out to be the Hudson. After reading the reviews, I was horrified to think of what kind of closet I would be staying in. However, since it was a ""done deal"", I had no choice.
The Hudson is on W 58th Street, but you need to know the address as there is absolutely no signage whatsoever. Upon arriving via taxi, I was greeted by a very nice and personable door man and he was very accomidating from the get-go. You enter the lobby through the ground floor and take escalators to the main lobby. I have to admit, the lobby is quite nice with dark wood and low light. Be sure the check out the light fixture hanging over the right side of the check in desk. The check in clerk was extremely nice, but check in took a bit longer than I was used to; There were some extra forms to fill out since Hotwire had listed my home address as theirs, and the hotel wanted mine. I then went to my room, expecting the worst as far as side. What I found was accurate.
My room was on the 23rd floor(top floor) which was good, because it was both away from the bar noise and street noise for the most part. The room itself was TINY. I thought to myself that everything in it was mini- the tv, the toilet, etc. I am 6'2 and weigh 240; my partner is 6'1 and weighs 180; it was very difficult for us to be in the room other than to sleep. The sleeping room itself was probably 8x5 at best and the bathroom was probably 2x6. I have never seen a smaller room in my life. The bed itself was a queen and the linens were nice and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom had a mini tub with a shower, which was open to the bedroom via a thin curtain; not too good if you did not know your roommate too well. The toiletries provided were nice though and there was daily maid service. The room itself was very clean, but again how much was there to really clean?
Breakfast at the Hudson Cafeteria was expensive, but then this is NYC. A breakfast buffet for two was $67.00; it was good, but really there are tons of small family owned restaurants in the neighborhood where you can get a great breakfast for under $8 a person. The bar at the Hudson is always packed; be prepared for large crowds and loud music. However, being on the top floor, I didnt hear a thing.
Pros: Clean and Convienent. Its only a short walk to Times Square and the theater district. Its safe and an easy walk. The Subway at Columbus Circle is about a block.. Nice staff and accomidating staff
Cons: SMALL room; I would have been disappointed if I had paid more than $149.00. However, for that price it was a good deal and very clean. I definitely would not stay there and pay full price; if you can snag a deal for under $175, then its a good choice.
I would stay again if I can get a deal as it is very, very close to everything and at least clean. However, if you need a bigger place to crash this is not it.",Ldenny818,2008-01-01,223023,2008-01-22,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“i was worried...” We booked the Hudson over Christmas at an awesome rate (130.00) but i was worried as to what i would find based on some of the reviews. We were so pleasantly surprised! Yes, the vibe is cool, chic and even funky, but the staff could not have been nicer, the food was great and the library was an awesome place for a predinner cocktail or to just hang out and read your book. Upon arrival we asked if we could up grade to a suite for Christmas day-no problem! And, boy was that nice-bedroom, livingroom, bar area, 2 bathrooms, enough room for us to spread out and open gifts. If you want a brightly lit, spacious room this place is not for you. this hotel is supposed to be like a night club. that is the whole theme throughout. Remember, that the Morgan group are the people that INVENTED the velvet rope! This hotel is set up for the party and they make no bones about it. Don't come to it if you are a business traveler or a family with small children-you will not be happy as this in not what the hotel is meant to be. we loved the location, we loved the way you could step out of the doors and get a cab-hailed for you by the hotel staff....We would stay again-if we could get a good price again (of course i wouldn't pay full new york city prices on any hotel) Remember....leave the brief case, kids and attitude at home!

“Amazingly different experience!” Despite what you might read from the other reviews please do not let the descriptions on how small the room is from deciding wether you should stay or night. My wife and I stayed at the hudson for a 4 day NYC getaway and simply loved it. The hotel is located right by columbus circle which has a great park for one to sit and people watch as well as access to the central park. The overall look of the hotel is amazing. We were greeted at the front door by the Hudson staff and took the escalator up to the lobby. A very different and unique lobby the Hudson has created. Somewhat dark and cozy with a great music selection playing through the speakers. Yes the rooms are small but the way they have set up the room with its layout and decorations one really does not think twice about the size. We both were very pleased with the room especially with the tv they have on the wall and stereo system. They also have a I pod docking station. The Library bas is a must go for a drink especially the rooftop terrace where you can relax and catch a great view of the city. The Hudson club was packed on Saturday night with a great DJ. I suggest requesting a floor on a higher level. We also recomend the restaurant at the Hudson with a succulent menu. Try the garlic potato fries.

"“pay $$$$$$ for the designer name” We've stayed at the hotel for two nites in September 2008.
tiny bathrooms most og the rooms featuring only showers. Can't be 2 people in the bathroom at the same time :(((
double size beds (not queen nor king) low to the floor. nice furniture quite fanky but not worth the price.

"“Loved it -- until I got to my room” If you are looking for a hotel uptown, this is a great location. It is close to the Time Warner Shopping Center, LIncoln Center, and Central Park. It is in close proximity to some good restaurants unlike the midtown and theatre district hotels. When arriving at the hotel, I was taken by the ambiance of the lobby. Everything is dressed in rich woods and the lighting is subtle and inviting. There is a nice little restaurant connected to the lobby and the outdoor bar is great in the summer. The service at the front desk was very efficient. So, overall the hotel had a very promising first ten minutes. If you are only going to be in your room to sleep, you will probably like this hotel just fine. I say that because the rooms are absolutely tiny. They are closest compared to a room on a cruise ship and I'm not talking about the luxury cruise ships of today. I mean the cruise ships built in the 1980's where you can barely move around in the cabin and the bathroom only accomodates someone the size of an elf. Furthermore, once you find the television in the cabinet (that you can lean over and reach from the bed) you will be a little irritated at a boutique hotel offering a 13 inch tv for your viewing pleasure. I would not stay here again. There are plenty of other hotels in the city that offer rooms with better size and accessories for a similar price. The Hudson is a good place to go and have a drink in the summer, but I would not book anything more than an overnight stay for business if you are getting a room.",whijo03,2008-01-01,223023,2008-01-20,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Nice Hotel, Small Room, Nice Decoration” I stayed in The Hudson in December 2006 with my finacee.
The hotel is very well decorated and the staff are friendly and helpful with regards to restaraunt recomendations and general service. We stayed 4 days and ate in the restarant once which was a nice experience, you generally sit on a long table with other people which adds to the social aspect The food was of a good quality and we enjoyed our night out.
We stayed in a standard bedroom which was very small, which isn't unusual for New York but does take something away from your stay.
The Hotel has quite a trendy bar downstairs which seems to be frequented by revel goers on a night out most nights which may not be everyone's cup of tea but if you do venture into it then it does have a good atmosphere.
The location is pretty good being near the south west corner of central park and time square within easy walking distance.
All in all I had a nice stay but would look to go to a different hotel if I returned to New York in the future.",garbfink,2006-12-01,223023,2008-09-24,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Avoid This Hotel If You're a Larger Person” The Hudson Hotel rooms are smaller than any I've ever seen, including those in Europe. (Management must be making a killing - I think they took each room during renovations and sliced them in two, but don't charge anywhere near half the rate.) The room is about 8 foot by 16 foot total. The bathroom is so tiny, they use toilets the same size as those used by pre-schools. I found it difficult to, ahem, get a bit of reading in, as the toilet was so tiny and close to the wall that my knees were touching the wall. If you're over 6 foot, you might not be physically capable of using the toilet. The shower stall is so small, you can barely turn around. And the bedroom is so small, it's hard to regulate the temperature and humidity in the room. (And the HVAC system they use has lousy controls.) The bed is one mattress, low to the ground. They desk chair is metal, the desk is tiny. And on the ninth floor, you can hear the boom boom of the music downstairs, with the windows closed. And then, at 3:00 a.m. a bunch of cars honking horns woke me up. They need better windows. Not a pleasant stay. Could use a sign out front too.",PatTheMat,2008-09-01,223023,2008-09-23,False,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Not Recommended - Overpriced” Rooms were extremely small. Even for NYC, just way too small... bed was also small and very close to the ground... NOT COMFORTABLE. Bathroom was tiny tiny, so tiny that there wasn't enough space for my make up bag!
Funny fact: My 15'' TV was hidden in the closet and it took me a while to find it, it was literally 17'' at most, remember those really old TVs? yes, it was one of them, it was so old that they had to attach an electronic device to it so that it would work on a remote control... my friend had a big LCD on the wall of his room, which was opposite to mine.
The theme of the hotel was nice, the dimmed lights were a good touch, but i just felt that i was staying at a youth hostel in europe, but ten times the price.

"“poor maintenance” Stayed at the Hudson on business after staying in many Morgans Group hotels (Clift, Mondrian LA, Royalton, Morgans, Delano). The first night, the room's air conditioning wasn't working when I checked in and maintenance came up four times to fix. Turned out it was an issue with the circuit breaker which they couldn't fix and the hotel was sold out so they couldn't move me to another room. It was 1:30 am by that point, so didn't want to move. Had to call multiple times to finally speak with a manager since none of my voice mail messages were returned.
They moved me to a new room the next day and guess what, the fan on the A/C didn't work in this room. Maintenance spent about 45 minutes working on the unit (at 11pm) and didn't have a new unit to replace it with - and hotel sold out again - so another night without air conditioning. 
In addition, when trying to access the wireless internet got a ""too many connections"" error and when I was finally able to connect the speed was so low (similar to a 56K modem as measured by Speakeasy's speedtest) that it was maddening. 
Overall, a very disappointing experience as I've had many enjoyable experiences at other Morgans Group hotels.",kinotype,2008-09-01,223023,2008-09-17,False,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“beautiful design hotel” The Hudson has all the hallmarks of Philippe Starck design, beautiful common spaces, really stunning, the light bar is particularly special. The overall theme of the hotel is of a college, so there is a big library room, and many places to sit, see and be seen.
The rooms are very small, not even space to lay out your suitcase, and the see-through glass showers may not be everyone's cup of tea.

"“More funky than a funky funky thing...” I found the hotel easy to find - but I dont think there is a sign post... just check out the images from the website - if you can remember what it looks like you wont have any problems locating it, which is suggested in some reviews.
It is beautiful inside - the ivy covred lobby ceiling is really impressive. The staff at check in are polite, professional, friendly and helpful.
The rooms are small, but really clean, and the bed was very comfy. Housekeeping is really good.. the room was cleaned thoroughly every day.
there was a CD player in my room, so i sort of wished that i'd taken a couple of cds to listen to while i was getting ready.
the freebie toiletries are nice enough.
I stayed over a long weekend, and the hotel has a very buzzy atmosphere on friday and saturday nights.. i was returning from a long day of sight seeing, so it wasnt really the best place for me as I'd have liked to have proped myself somewhere for a quiet cup of coffee in the evening, just for half an hour before bed.. but maybe im getting a little old!! 
but - if you're away with the girls, then its really fabulous - be sure to book a table in the outside bar area if you're wanting to have drinks there.. its really pricey though, we paid $40 for a round consisting of an orange juice, lager, and a bellini, the drinks were lovely,and the service was ok. but i thought $40 was a bit steep.
check out was before 12noon, and quick and easy, and you can store your luggage while you spend time in the city before going back to the airport... the doorman will collect your bags if you present the little ticket at the door on street level. thats nice and easy.

"“cool but tiny” Cool hotel with great style. This was my second trip @ the Hudson, but I think I'm over it. Great design, nice people (mostly). The area okay, not too much to do around there in the winter, and the Hudson closes the garden and rooftop in the winter. Bummer, because those are two of the coolest places of the hotel. We much more enjoyed downtown vs. midtown. Hotel in pricey restaurant area unless you want average Thai or Indian food.
The rooms are really tiny with thin doors, could hear other guests coming and going. No coffee, no robes, tiny TV (free HBO), WI-FI is 10$ a day. If you are a total style junky you may want to stay here, but I would recommend just a visit to the hotel and that should satisfy you enough.

"“Chic, but not great!” The lobby was beautiful! Unfortunately, that is where it ends! The hallways were scary! Dark and dingy. The rooms were ridiculously small. I have been traveling to NYC for 20 years and I know about the room sizes that can be found in most hotels, this was ridiculous. I paid TOO MUCH - almost $400 per night. Horrible value. The bed was terribly uncomfortable, more like a cheap futon mattress. The lighting in the rooms and bathroom was unacceptable. I could barely see anything and it made everything appear depressing and dingy. When I was having an issue with my ATM card (I am from California, so note the time difference). I asked if they would give me a small cash advance on my credit card and they flatly refused! Unbelievable!

"“The Hudson; edgy but tight” The Hudson is a tourist class hotel which caters mostly to young tourists from overseas. The design on the main/public floor is edgy and, except for the dim lighting, comfortable. The standard room is a different story. It's a basic (tiny) 8'x10' space that resembles a crew cabin on a yacht. Small bed, two plastic stools and an aluminum kitchen-style chair serving as a desk chair. Tiny desk with a flimsy lamp (which worked occasionally). Popcorn ceiling. The bathroom is approximately 3/4 the size of a restroom on an aircraft. There is a 9 inch space to get to the shower (no tub). 
If you like IKEA simplicity and tight spaces, this is your hotel. Anyone over 6 feet will be uncomfortable (at 6'3"", I actually had to duck to avoid hitting my head on the exit signs in the hallways).
On a positive note, the staff is helpful (allowed early check in) and the location, near Central Park and the Time Warner Center, is excellent.

"“Super expensive for a shoe box - don't bother” The Hudson is a super trendy and well located hotel sited at the bottom west corner of central park. Its bar, restaurant and library bar are all lovely, but it's so popular and has such limited seating, that unless you've reserved before you even arrive, it's impossible to get a seat to have a drink there because all of the non-resident guests that flock to the hotel. We went into the bar and library on three or four occassions only to be confronted with 100% of the seats and tables being ""reserved"". We also had to wait until 10.30 pm to eat dinner on the first night (after arriving at 8 ish) because of the queue.
The hotel is funky though.
On the room front - just don't go there! The room is basically a bed plus a foot either side to walk around. The bathroom is a box that is separated from the bedroom by a window with a thin curtain over it and is no wider than 3 foot. You can't actually go to the toilet without having your legs facing sideways as your knees would bang against the wall!
On our last day and night there, no-one made up our room all day. We called at 5.30pm to report this and ask for it to be done, but when we returned at 8 pm it still wasn't. We therefore called again pretty unhappy (as had no water and no clean towels for a shower), and when we returned from dinner at 11 pm it still wasn't done. This was pretty unacceptible, especially as we had to leave at 5 am the next morning. I called the Duty Manager to complain, but he just told me his records showed it had been made up and that someone had tried to come 5 times to make up the room, but we hadn't let them in. I explained that we had asked for it to be done when we knew we were out, as there was no way it could have been done with us standing in the 1 ft of space around the bed, to which he said ""you have asked for an additional service, and therefore need to be there to let the chambermaid in"". I explained it wasn't an additional service to get your room made up once a day, to which he said that his records showed it had already been made up .... I invited him to come to our room to show him that it hadn't been made up, but he said that as we were now in the room, that would prove nothing. He basically intimated that i was lying about the room not being made up and kept repeating his line about the records showing ... blah blah blah .... as you can see this was a bit of a circular argument, which wound me up immensly and got me nowhere. when i complained when back in the UK, I was ""thanked"" for my feedback and told that they hoped i would stay again. I won't!!!

"“Great Location - very busy hotel” We stayed at the Hudson over Christmas and New Year. The location is excellent very close to Central Park and within walking distance of Times Square, Fifth Ave etc. There is a subway 1 minute away, which is very useful, particularly if you buy the seven day metro pass which is only $24 and gives you unlimited journeys. There has been alot said by previous reviewers regarding the room size, we booked a deluxe with a queen bed, but were given a king bed. The room was very small, I asked the front desk if they had given us a standard room in error, but they hadn't so I can only guess how cramped they are! The bathroom is tiny and would be difficult to use if you are tall. The design of the rooms and the decor however is very contemporary and smart like the whole hotel interior (just don't bring too many suitcases)
The bar's are very swanky, however, the main bar is obviously a trendy hangout for locals, so is very packed on weekends. There is a long queue to get in, however if you produce your room key you can skip the queue. 
The service is very good in the Hudson and the maid service as good as I have seen. The concierge and door men etc. are excellent also and will grab taxis for you immediately. Overall I would recommend this hotel, but be prepared in advance for the room size and if you can afford a larger room - do so. In reality as there is so much to do in the City, your room will most likely be a pitt stop and you won't be in it too much.",GabrielRamsey,2007-12-01,223023,2008-01-12,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Horrible small bathrooms” The Hudson has a great location, very close to columbus Circle & Central park South, the lobby & resteraunt area are very nice, chic with good service, but the rooms are horrible, even by NYC standards, its like being in a Tokyo capsule room & the bathrooms are just plain awful.You cant even turn around let alone put out any toletories, its awful & just not acceptable, especially at the prices this hotel charges.",Njhammers,2008-01-01,223023,2008-01-09,False,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Pros and Cons” Pros:
-The location of the Hudson is ideal. You can walk to lots of popular sights and restaurants and are an easy taxi ride from the rest.
-The staff was very professional and efficient. We used their help several times for directions and reservations.
-The bar downstairs is very trendy and popular. If that's your sort of thing then you have a great place to go right in the hotel.
Cons:
-Yes, the rooms are small. But in the Hudson's defense, when you book online they give you the exact size of the room you are booking. 
-Our room was very cold. We were there during one of the first cold spells of the winter and our room was never any warmer than 60 degrees F though we had the thermostat turned all the way up.
-Drinks in the bar are very expensive. I was expecting NYC prices but $25/drink?
-Breakfast was mediocre. I was hoping for better.
So, it's not the best hotel in NYC but it's not the worse either. I will not be staying there again but it was not bad enough to consider moving to another hotel during our stay.",kellyincville,2008-11-01,223023,2008-11-22,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
“New york new york” The Hudson was clean but very unfriendly and the bedrooms small and dull. I also found this hotel hard to find.

"“The room was OK but some of the other trip advisor comments are true !!!” We have just returned from staying at The Hudson as we had travelled in NYC for New Year. This was our 4th visit to NYC and we wanted to stay in a different area and we have stayed in other Morgan hotels previously and have always enjoyed our stay, so we thought we would give The Hudson a go. 
We reviewed what other travellers had written so we decided to up grade to a loft suite, which is something we would recommend if you can afford it. Our room was small by suite standards so we can only believe the other reviews about the size of the rooms !! To be honest, if you want a comfortable, clean and well kept room, which our was, we would recommend this hotel, particularly if you like contemporary hotels. However, much of what everyone else writes about is true and we would urge you to consider these before deciding whether to stay here or not:-
The staff at the Hudson could possibly win the award for the most rudest, unhelpful and unapproachable staff award - everything seemed too much and no one went out of their way to help you;
The corridors do need some modernising and we understand why there is dim lighting everywhere - to hide the stains and the poorly kept corridors!!!;
By the end of our visit the staff had got on our nerves so much we phoned the manager to explain that they should look on www.tripadvisor.com to read what their guests are saying and explained how rude we thought the staff were - the managements response “I am sorry to hear about that” - clearly they are not bothered, so why should their staff !!!!
The room however was very noisy (road traffic, bar noise and neighbouring rooms) and kept you awake on and off all night and our window had a draft so you would wake up in the night due to being cold !!! I think it is fair to say that you have to accept a little noise wherever you stay in NYC, but this place was a new level !!!
Overall, we cannot fault our room as it had everything we wanted (except maybe not to have a draft and the windows to be noise proofed !!), however, due to the staff at The Hudson we wouldn’t choose to stay here again, particularly not for $550 plus tax a night when there are so many other options in Manhattan.
There is a great Diner called Flame one block from the hotel (turn left outside of hotel and you will see it) and a great Irish Bar called Kennedy’s just around the corner on 57th Street on 7th. The staff could learn a trick or two about politeness from the guys in Kennedy’s !!!",Alvin&Tracy,2007-12-01,223023,2008-01-09,False,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Christmas Stay, Very close to Central Park, Starbucks” I stayed here for Christmas since I got a great deal from Hotwire.
Pluses about this place is that it's a great location. Really close to central park, Starbucks and a few good restaurants. 
Plenty of elevators but there are tons of people going up and down in the morning.
Negatives.
Noisy traffic
Tiny rooms even though we got an upgrade
The subway is about 3 blocks away. I guess it's not horrible but we stayed at other hotels with the subway 1 block away which in my opinion is huge.
Overall, I'd stay here again if I could get another great deal. I wouldn't pay full price.",imoments,2007-12-01,223023,2008-01-08,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Can't wait to Return!” My Boyfriend and I stayed at the Hudson over Christmas, for one week. We were nervous due to some of the reviews online, mainly about the hot water issues. We booked the room online, and got a pretty reasonable rate in comparison to the others in the city. 
We were totally blown away upon arrival, our cab driver knew exactly where the hotel was, and it IS just as pretty as the pictures are online! We were greeted fairly quickly at the check-in desk, and the guy helping us gave us the option for having a shower or bath, we chose shower. Everything was covered before we received our keys, and yes they do hold an extra $300 on your card if any damages should happen to the room. And actually our entire bill for the room was never put on hold! The entire transaction did not go through until we checked out!!
The hotel was actually super hot, we could definitely tell the heaters were working! In fact we used our air conditioner majority of the time! We were very pleased with our room, yes it is only 150 sq. ft, but it is very modern... nice and extremely clean. We were hardly in our room during the day, but I must admit I actually could not wait to get back to it at night ! The beds are very comfortable, the heater/air conditioner is not extremely loud, as others complained about. You could hear the pipes knocking a little bit, but these things did not bother us. We also could hear some noise from the street, but hello! That is new York! It did not keep us awake at night at all. My ONLY complaint is that the maid cleaned our room (every single day in fact) even when our ""privacy please"" was hanging on the door, which turned out to be nice after all. 
My knees did touch the wall while on the toilet :) They provide very nice products for the bathroom. The T.V. was 13 inches, but we had a lot of channels. We could hear a bit of noise from our neighbors, but nothing too annoying. And the famous bar...lol, after a long day, coming into the hotel at night, they do have the music turned up, it was cool actually for us to come""home"" to, we did not mind. We absolutely could not hear it in our rooms, NO bass thumping etc:!!!
We can't wait for our second trip, we loved the Hudson and the city! It was a very nice location, very safe, and we felt right at home.

I read the reviews on priceline and trip advisor and I knew the room was going to be small and indeed everybody was right! It is true, you don’t spend ur time in the room but I think you could use a little bit more space when u try to relax; The lounge/club is nice, the restaurant is nice and good food, the personnel is helpful.

"“Acceptable, but small room and weird lobby” I knew something was strange when I walked right by the Hudson: there is no sign outside the door. Two doormen were muttering ""Hudson Hotel?"" in the furtive sotto voce I usually associate with sidewalk dealers asking ""Want some herb?"".
Once I had located the hotel, I ascended a long escalator to the lobby. The entrance, lobby, and some other common areas are lit in a creepy yellow-green fluorescent. Perhaps I'm too old to understand chic, but to me it resembled Minas Morgul in the Lord of the Rings movie. The lobby itself is so dim I almost walked into other guests more than once.
These are not the smallest rooms in NYC. I have stayed in the Paramount and they are even smaller. The bed occupies almost the entire room, the shower is at the foot of the bed, separated by only a curtain, and the toilet is on the far side of the shower. I was actually rather impressed with the room's utilization of space, putting the stereo in the closet and a TV hinged to the wall. I was reminded of rooms in some Japanese hotels (except in Japan, the bedding is also very short).
I got this hotel from Priceline as a 3-1/2 star. The price was (very) right, but that extra half-star compared to their other listings is bogus. The experience is in contrast to unrefurbished hotels with larger rooms (e.g., Salisbury and Wellington); on balance I think I prefer the latter.
I should also mention that the female staff (check-in, concierge, restaurant hostess, and waitress) were all so cheery I wonder how many male guests get the wrong idea.",drlaz,2008-11-01,223023,2008-11-20,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
“Shocked and in need of a Chiropractor” I have stayed at the various Morgen hotel group hotels throughout the years and have always been impressed but this time I was seriously underwhelmed.The lobby was cool and chic and the halls reminded me of othe boutique Hotels out there but when I go to the room and opened the door it was like a closet. There was barely enough room for the double bed whose mattress was a glorified futon. My body still hurts from sleeping on it. The HVAC unit ran so loud and swung wildly in it's temperature range that it was impossible to get comfortable. The flat screen TV has position whereby if you slanted it towards the bed just so you could see it.; you lost valuable walking space around the bed not to mention the fact you still had to crook your neck to see it. The bathroom has a petite round bowl toilet that if any male over 5' 10' tried to sit his knees would be jammed against the wall. You could easily stay almost anywhere in NYC for $500 and have clean modern accommodations. So why would you ever do it here. Certainly not for inclusive parking and a cafeteria style Old Country Buffet breakfast. The place it filled with European travelers who might be acustomed to small digs but I think even they were taken back.,travelinguy,2008-11-01,223023,2008-11-11,False,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Nice idea, but terribly small rooms” Lovely, modern hotel in a great location of NYC. Very intriguing lobby and bars. BUT, when you get to the room it all goes down hill. Rooms are so small (mine was 136 sq ft). My laptop didn't fit on the ""desk"" and there were not enough outlets to power my laptop w/o unplugging other things. I can't imagine how or where one would eat room service. Noise was also a problem. I had to check to make certain my window wasn't open because the street noise was incredible. You also hear everything in the halls. 
Bottomline, this place is not for a business traveler. And unless you plan to spend 99% of time outside of the room on a pleasure trip, then Hudson Hotel may not be for you either.

"“maybe if you're 5 ft tall.” While I agree the public spaces are nice, you're better off visiting them as a non-guest. The rooms are small and badly designed. The bathroom was so small that foot would not even fit between the wall edge and the toilet bowl. It made an airplane toilet look spacious in comparison. I got tired of banging my knees into the wall or hitting my head when I stood up and just went down to the lobby to go.
The large mirrors on the wall were undoubtedly to give a sense of space, it didn't work. The placement of the tv was awkward. The candy dish mounted on the other side of the room as a remote control holder was just - stupid. My husband banged his head on the tv getting out of the bed. The mattress itself was not very comfortable and I prefer to be more than 12 inches off the ground.

"“Doesn't meet its own high opinion of itself” This hotel is trying desperaely to be cutting edge. hence the dark corridors and rooms. Advice: bring a flashlight so you can see the contents of your suitcase.
When I arrived it was chaos outside and I had to drag my own cases into the lobby (on a bitter cold evening after a 12 hour flight - no I wasn't happy). When I left the next afternoon I had to hail my own cab outside and drag my bags out again as it was chaos once again.
Check in was efficient but perfunctory. When I eventually found my room down endless litter-strewn dark hallways I found it was occupied. Back to the front desk where they gave me another room, supposdely an ""upgrade"" which I think meant on a higher floor, not a larger room. Street noise was loud. Room tiny.

"“Warning! Proceed with caution” Firstly I have stayed in some wonderful hotels around the world including ""to cool for school places like the Hudson. Like other reviewers the bar areas are good but £100 for 8 drinks (not champers) is a little on the ""rich"" side.
The staff as well on the whole were good and the concierge was great.
Now the important stuff,
* They only had the queen delux room we booked with a shower when we needed a bath, and by the generator so a terrible noise (ask if you are on the 4/5/6th floors its noisy. So they put us in their standard room, for one night and then upgraded us to a studio on the second (nice I thought). The standard room is a joke. No where to put suitcases and I could not fit through the bathroom door without going side on (I'm not overly wide!). We were there with friends and they also tried to pass a standard room off as a deluxe with them - they were moved and not happy.
In our first night room (2345) the coat hook was falling off, the bath tap fell off, the caravan effect wood pannelling was loose on the on the door frame, the spot light was coming away from the ceiling, the shower rail had screw holes protuding where they had messed up the installation. I have to say as well in our shoe box the I really did not see the ""design"" theme in the artex ceiling. 
The beds were single matress on a frame ( sheets were good), towels were YMCA size and quality
It was just a shoddy, claustrophobic, cynical attempt to house 
those people who get so nailed in the bars the wouldnt notice the room size and quality.
The hallways were dark and two fire exit signs on the 23rd floor were loose.
On the second night the ""studio"" room was a reasonable size for a normal room. Apparantly having a ""seating area"" (read a two person sofa at the back of the room) made it a studio. The room was 1617. Better fitting in this room, but a floor board was raised and there looked to be damp or sometype of poor fix over the shower and the bed springs in the wire frame bed were noisy
Now the piece that really sealed the fate of this hotel from our perspective.
Our friends were staying in the hotel and I thought to buy them a botttle of champers on room service ($165 for a bottle of Veuve anyone?) My wife bought another present for them, so I asked to cancel the bottle (I had signed). It was not opened and in perfect condition and our friends were were not in the room, so it could have been retrieved. Two managers told me I had signed and they would not take it back, even though I requested this 10mins after signing and I offered to pay the $18 service and $4 delivery charge. I'm still in dispute on this one. (There were 3 other disputes going on as we checked out)
I know this is long but I wanted to be precise and descriptive.
In summary, over priced, poor quality, cynically small rooms, but with generally nice staff. Stay somewhere else and if you really m ust, enjoy the bar.",cris9964,2008-12-01,223023,2008-12-20,False,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

We then proceeded to the ""library"" for a drink. Although crowded we were able to secure a table for the 4 of us but were promptly told that the table was reserved. We asked if we could sit and talk until the reservation showed up. Well, they did.... over one hour late.... and we were summarily asked to leave. We then carried our extremely expensive drinks out to the lobby area where we found three seats together. We pulled a fourth chair over to accomodate all of us and were informed that we were not permitted to move chairs in the lobby. We then carried our drinks to the restaurant bar and were again informed we could not enter with drinks form another establishment (from the bar across the lobby?).

"“Great Place For Girl Trip!” I have never bothered writing a review before- however, I felt obligated to share our positive experience after reading the negatives! We just came back from a 3 night stay- I was skeptical after the reviews.....First of all, our cab driver had NO problem getting us there, we had NO problem identifing the building....NO problem checking in- (approx 1 min. wait in line-around 2:30 p.m.) David was very polite and professional:). Our standard room was located on the 10th floor with a nice city view. The room was cozy, so limit the amount of luggage you bring! We had no problem manuvering around our room- just keep tidy!

We had 20"" flat screen tv & A nice stereo that we could jam to while getting ready for a night out! -bring your cd's. The hotel staff was friendly, housekeeping did a fantastic job! We shared a large tasty shrimp dish at the hotel restraunt for $23. Bar scene was like a bunch of NY 'ers having a high school reunion- the locals party there (makes it interesting!). We were leary @ first,- by our last night, we tore the dance floor up! If you have to buy a mixed drink it will be $12.- We made our own bar in our room! Hotel location was GREAT- 1 blk from subway. Central park is 2 blks away. There are plenty of local places to eat for a decent price especially if you can split the meal with your co-traveler!

"“Hip but cramped, not good for business travel” This was my second stay at the Hudson. First the good things. Lobby, restaurants, and bar are very hip and fun. View from the rooftop is awesome. Location is super. No coffee pot in the room, but Time Warner Center is right across the street and Starbucks is a block away. Very close to Central Park and Lincoln Center. Also, the bed was like a big fluffy futon (on a wooden platform) but really comfortable.
I heard a lot of European accents on elevator, so this must be a favorite for international travelers.
Now the not so good. Staff is so caught up in being hip they forget they're supposed to take care of guests. (However, the bellmen are super -- they offered to lock up my computer in their safe while I was in meetings.)
The regular rooms are smaller than the inside cabin of a cruise ship. If you sit on the toilet in the bathroom, you bump your knees against the opposite wall. Really, it's that small. If you're alone, it's not so bad. Last time I was there with my spouse for 3 days and it got very tight. There's no place to put a 2nd suitcase, so we had to put it on the floor beside the bed and step on it to walk around.
Hallways are painted charcoal gray and you feel like you're moving through a cave. A little creepy. I also had so much cold air and noise from the window I checked to see if it was open. Bring earplugs if you want to sleep.
This is not an easy hotel for a business traveller. The business center was OK (4-5 computer stations, 2 printers, unattended). I went there at 8:30 PM to print out my presentation for the next morning and the b/w printer was out of toner. I didn't get this message until I had swiped my credit card and paid for 15 minutes of computer time. The concierge said ""Well I don't know how soon I can get someone up there"" (sounded like she was yawning). I told her I would come to her desk and use her printer. She didn't refuse, and she requested a refund for my card. After all that, my card was charged double the quoted rate and I had to make multiple calls to get it credited. I think they're much more concerned with running the swanky bar than with keeping their business travellers comfortable. They make a lot more money from the bar. Just something good to know if you're trying to work from your room.

We stayed at this hotel during our honeymoon and would like to warn other before doing so. The rooms are very small for the price you pay, the staff are not that friendly and we had a piece of jewellery go missing from our room.

"“Terrible, Horrible, Sleepless and Bugs” What an awful experience at the Hudson! Lets see- the first room had a cock roach in it (waited 20 minutes to speak to a manger who never came out nor followed up on this).
 Second room- smelled like smoke (which the front desk never mentioned), the heater was broken, a shelf was falling off in the bathroom, and the floor was bubbled and sinking by the bathroom. 
 Third room- another broken heater but this one sounded like someone was inside banging a wrench on the pipes all night!!! plus the mini bar was barely stocked (which we took a picture of and made a copy of all the things that were missing so we would not be held responsible for it). 
 Check-out FINALLY a manager ""had time"" to discuss the situations with us and comp our parking- a whole $110. Two nights, three horrible rooms and then.... when I checked my credit card at the end of the week there was a $94.24 charge from the Hudson- for the mini bar!! 
**DO NOT STAY HERE! the lobby and lounge were beautiful (but maybe they should put some of the money back into keeping up with room maintenance), the concierge and valet amazing- but the rest of the headaches are not even comparable to be worth it.

"“Super Cool Spot” I've stayed in several places in NY but this has to be the coolest spot in the city. Ok, the rooms are a little on the small side and the lobby area can feel more like a nightclub after dark, but that's what makes this place so funky. 
Prices are on the high side (especially for us poor Brits now) but it's a great location near Central Park. There's an awesome little diner across the road (Flames) which serves great comfort food at really low prices.

"“Just Okay - Location makes up for some negatives” The location is great - super-close to Columbus Circle, Central Park, Broadway, and we walked to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and more. The hotel was a safe and somewhat clean place to sleep. We were treated respectfully but indifferently by most of the staff, but the bellhops were really great. Beyond that I don't have much good to say. I get that the decor is supposed to be funky, modern, and edgy, but it is downright weird in two areas - the outside of the hotel and the hallways. Outside there is no sign, no indication at all that it is a hotel. It's a good thing our taxi driver knew where he was going. Look at the photo on the hotel website and take away the bright yellow lights and cleanliness, and that's what it looks like. The entire hotel is much too dark. Seriously consider taking a flashlight along!!! The hallways are yuck. Very tight, very dark, almost scary - painted a dark gray color from floor to ceiling, trim to doors. You can't even tell where the elevators are because they are painted the same dark color as everything else and have no lighting. They felt dirty, too. It seemed like they were super-dark to hide how run-down and dirty they were. The hotel's website says the rooms are modeled after ship cabins. The teeny tiny size is the only thing about the rooms that resemble ship cabins. The hallways are definitly like the hallways of a navy submarine! Our room was one of the bigger ones in that it had space at the end of the bed, side tables, and a tiny desk and chair. The pillows and matress were worn out, the floor was very dusty, and the windows were useless to keep out the cold wind and noise. The heater was loud and clangy too. The bathroom was ridiculously small, though clean enough. We had to sit sideways on the toilet because there wasn't enough room for our knees the regular way. To get into the teeny shower, we had to climb over the toilet. I really didn't like this hotel b/c doesn't come near the descriptions on the company webiste, and because it is sooo dark!!!

"“overrated” We paid via Expedia and paid far more than the rate shown on the website.The manager refused to address our concerns or to offer a discount because he said we had booked through Expedia.The rooms were dark,poorly equipped with no electical socket near a mirror and one of the three rooms we stayed in was next to the control A/C generator and was very very noisy all night.In our third room the heating broke down,in mid winter too.
The worst element was the state and size of the bathrooms.A bath so small you had to squat in it,a toilet so crammed in that your knees hit the wall when you sat down.No space to put any toiletries and overall a disgrace.This ex girls dormitory hotel passes itself off as quaint and trendy.The public rooms may just pass but the 3 rooms that we stayed in were all sub standard and we were charged £350 per night.We are still fighting for a refund.Take my advice avoid this hotel at any price.",coller,2008-12-01,223023,2008-12-11,False,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Very below average!” A very disappointing stay in a Morgan Group/Philippe Starck hotel. After staying in The Sanderson in London (also a Morgan Group hotel) we were expecting big things from The Hudson and unfortunately it came nowhere near average.
The rooms were far too small and the bathrooms were ridicolously tiny. On the first night, we changed rooms after 3 hours - the noise from the street below was immense and the window didn't block the sound out at all. My knees touched the wall when using the toilet, the portable tv was shoved in a corner cupboard, there was no drawer space and no bath.
We were moved from floor 5 to floor 12, this room was slightly bigger and there was a bath in this room but we were still disappointed. On numerous occasions, the plug blocked in the bath when showering and one morning we were greeted with a bath full of backed up water which was disgusting!
At night the reception area was very noisy with music from the famous Hudson Bar which is adjoined to the hotel. Taking this into account, it seems that the bar is the most important thing here and the hotel is given second priority.

This is not a hotel for everyone - the public areas are darkly lit, the bar is loud and funky the design is contemporary and avant garde.

The room (604) was clean, and although a bit on the small side, in no way claustrophobic.

"“Nice staff...very dark spaces” I just returned from a four night stay at the Hudson. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Checkin was total bedlam because so many people were checking in at the same time. My room,a one bedroom suite, was not ready. I arrived thirty minutes past checkin, but my room was not available for nearly two hours. The manager kept me in the know about my room and gave me six free drink tickets,good thing, a glass on wine is$18! My room was just fine, plenty big enough, but it is about the largest available. I booked a standard room for my son, and I must admit my closet at home is much larger. My overall experience was a good one, but this hotel is not for old people, people with children, nor anyone who needs much light! The hallways are seedy looking and the platform beds not very comfortable.

Bad things - snotty front desk (questioned us when we told them we called ahead to confirm that we could check in early). Terrible service when things went wrong.

We went to the other room and waited for 20 minutes in the hall way with our luggage! I tried to go back to the lobby, but it was busy so ended up standing in line again. We called the main number and finally someone showed up to let us into the room. Which was freezing cold - had to run the heater for 1 hour to warm up the room. The heating unit popped and clicked all night making it difficult to sleep, and when we called to voice our grievance the manager was rude.

The staff was very friendly and helpful and even went out of their way to find out if parking regulations would be enforced on Christmas day when I had inquired. It is crazy expensive for room service and other services and don't think about taking a hanger because they will charge you $15 if you do.

"“A New York experiential hotel” We stayed in the Hudson Hotel for three nights during Christmas, 2007. The location is great, just a block from Columbus circle and the South End of Central Park. The hotel was booked through Priceline bidding-only $100 a night-and that price, although low for NYC, seems fair for the Hudson. The hotel is extremely stylized/trendy/urban chic, so much so that there is no Hudson Hotel sign on the exterior of the hotel. Having found it by the address, we entered glass doors to an escalator taking us up to the hotel lobby. The lobby is very dimly lit, adding to the ambiance, and is also attractively decorated, with comfortable seating. Too dim for reading, but good if you are waiting for someone. There are two bars, both with great design and decor, but expensive drinks ($9 for a bottle of beer) and a restaurant with $18 burgers. But then this is midtown Manhattan. There were many Europeans staying in the hotel, fortunate people able to eat and drink on the strength of the Euro. 
The rooms have been discussed in many other posts, and they are every bit as tiny as described. In our case, the rooms were clean, my number one criterion, and well supplied, so I didn't want to complain about the size. But by the end of our three day stay, I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE! I saw many families while I was there and I couldn't imagine how they managed to coexist in those rooms. 
I would recommend the Hudson Hotel for the convenient location and the decor.",Elaine051_7,2007-12-01,223023,2007-12-27,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

We had a drain problem in our shower that did not fix itself until we were ready to leave. The room was hot even though we turned off the heat, but it was not unbearable.

"“Hudson Hotel-DON'T STAY” If you're a regular 3-4 star hotel-goer and are used to comfortable settings and a lavish look of the room, this hotel is NOT for you. We booked on priceline and ended up with this hotel. We decided to check out a day early and booked the Grand Hyatt for the final night. The Hudson is very modern, so if you're in to that, stay there. The hotel room was not VERY small, but it is small. Since they wanted it to be trendy and hip, it comes across very cold. The beds are a few inches from the floor and the walls are panelled. There are not features in the room to soften it. So, if you're used to curtains, comforters and more ""things"" in a hotel room to make it seem warmer, don't stay here. I'm sure it is great for people who like a very modern look and feel and can do without that ""warm"" feeling. The water was turned off throughout one night due to maintenence and our water didn't work a few times. The staff did come immediately and fix it. The staff were very friendly, but this is not ""Ritz Carlton service"" if that is what you are used to. In regard to an artsy hotel, the two bars are very cool and artistic...so if you're going for the atmosphere, this is neat. If you're only into location, this is in a very good location.

For all females your GHD will not work in the USA and a transformer will cost you $160 so you are better to buy a set from a supermarket which will cost around $30, not so good but better than ""fuzzy hair"".
The location of the hotel you cannot fault, so near to Central Park and only a 10 min walk to town. I was dissapointed with the staff at the reception they were not helpfull with any of our queries they did not seem to care, yet the housekeeping and door staff could not do enough for you.

"“NIce but small” My husband and I stayed at the Hudson the first weekend in December 2007 for a three night break. The staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed on the 23rd floor and did not hear any noise from the bar/club downstairs from our room. The bar is lovely and great for stopping off in on your way back from a busy day of shopping and sightseeing. 
Yes, the rooms are small as many others have mentioned. We could walk around our bed (however not a huge amount of space) and did have storage for our clothes - not a wardrobe with a door but a hanging rail and a shelf built into a recess. The bathroom was very small with a little bath and shower attachment. There was a door on our bathroom (some reviews I've read have said they didn't get one). There was also a glass wall separating the bath from the bedroom, however, you could pull a curtain across either side for privacy. I did notice that the air conditioning & heating were very noisy and right behind the headboard.

"“Its not so bad!!!” My 6 year old son and I stayed here for 2 nights (12/1/2007 & 12/2/07). Everyone has been wonderful. After reading all the neg reviews, I made sure to make contact with the front desk staff, just to see how the ""meanies"" were. Mark at the desk (he's from the midwest) was WONDERFUL. We were allowed to check-in an hour before the official check-in and we given a room right away. We have a late flight, and were offered a late checkout, they even offered to hold our luggage!
The location is great. A subway station is right around the corner. Central Park is so close you can get there walking in 2 minutes. They have vendors there every day until Christmas, so get there if you can.
The room is small, we are on the 14th floor, room 1412 to be exact. It quiet and we slept great last night. The internet costs $10 a day and can be spotty, but they'll let you use a booster if you need to.

We wanted to stay in another part of the city and the Hudson looked very unusual on its web page and the brochures. I had read the reviews and knew the rooms would be small but wanted to experience the hotel itself and was prepared to put up with a small room.
It is very very small so if you are staying for more than one night try somewhere else. The bar and restaurant are worth a visit and like other reviews I would recommend you visit for that but maybe get a bigger room somewhere else.

"“The joy stops at the lobby” The lobby was very cool. Post modern, no shortage of ghost chairs. Lively lobby Bar, very New York.
In 48 hours, we changed rooms 3 times. We booked a superior room to ensure satisfaction. The first room had a very noisy heating unit directly outside our window. The second room had no insulation and a moderate draft right onto us all night from the window directly above the bed, which was 1 foot shorter than standard. The heat was blaring to keep up with the draft. So we wasted time packing for the 3rd room. We now had NO HEAT. Before we left for the night we asked for it to be repaired. At 3 am after a fun night, we were calling maintainace again!. 
Style over basic function. We recommend you visit the Lobby Bar and book a room elsewhere!!!.

We immediately inquired about an upgrade, which wasn't all that much better, but at least you could walk around the bed. However, there is no place to store any clothes - no dresser or shelves and the lighting is terrible. We felt like we were in a cave for 3 days, living out of our suitcases.

"“Hudson where do I start!” Stayed at Hudson Hotel for 4 nights new years with my partner. It definetley is style over substance and more concern is given to non guests who come in to use the bar/nightclub.
Most of the staff are unwelcoming, from the ""think im famous doormen"" to the ""im too good to speak to you reception staff"". However there were a few staff members who asissted us and were polite .I think a reality check is required afterall it is the return visitors that keep this place afloat. 
The rooms are small dark non existent storage, not enough room for two people to navigate around but i didnt spend much in them too many places to go. The bathrooms are tiny but adeqaute to shower in. There is a see through window seperating the bathroom from the sleeping area just pull the curtain over for privacy. The room was freezing all through our stay and despite reporting this it took repeated complaints from me for anyone to address this. Its bizarre but the public areas are boiling hot all the time. The public areas are nice and Location is good close to Columbus but thats the best point.
The Hudson is stylish, unique and has some nice touches. It is overpriced for what it delivers which is why i would not return here again. I have stayed at hotels with fewer stars that have delivered a better service and prioritise their guests.

Hot water was fine. Staff seemed OK. The lobby and halls are incredibly dark and I wonder what they are hiding?? Anyway, we just laughed at that. What DID bother us was the unbelievably LOUD music coming from downstairs. I had read about that, too so I brought earplugs -- we still couldn't sleep. The music blasted away till 3AM. So loud that you could feel it thumping in your chest. And we were on the 7th floor ! No sleep, and we had a full day planned the next day. Weekend ruined.

I'd heard the rooms were small but as long as the bed was right no worries. Although I booked a ""Queen bed"" my ankles were left hanging over the end, so I left a day early.

Checking in wasn't very easy given the loud music and dim lighting. Staff were not very friendly either. Concierge desk was mostly unmanned but when staff were there they were extremely rude!
Lighting in the hotel lobby area was always dark (night club lighting all day long!) which got extremely annoying. Don't bother trying to use the public phones because you just can't see the numbers!

Although the architecture of this hotel is interesting and the staff is friendly, I have never stayed in such a small hotel room.

"“Excellent Hotel in Super location” We travelled throughout America in October having stayed in supposedly 4 star accommodation in Radisson, 4 point at the Sherraton and Crown Plazza however for some reason all the hotels in the US have a peculiar odour, posssibly through wet carpet, pets etc however we were lucky enough to book this hotel for 2 nights in October having paid around 160 per night whilst the going rate was around 440. The hotel has no carpet, having floorboards. There is no odour what so ever. 
We were afraid by the reviews about the room size however it is more than adequate, especially as we lugged 4 large suitcases. The presentation and the cleanliness of the room was the cleanest we encountered in the USA. Added to that we had a view on 37th street which made you feel part on NYC.
It is located less than a minute from Central Park, and about 5 minute walk from Broadway and Times square. They has a suited security guard near the lifts politely asking patrons who boarded the lifts for the hotel keys.
In the city that never sleeps we often wondered back to the hotel late at night and always felt comfortable in our surroundings.
The hotel has an extensive open terrace overllooking the city with a large number of bannana chairs, tables and areas where patrons can utilize to snack, engage in coversation etc as well as a reasonable equiped gym.
The only thing that I did not like was the incredibly dark and noisy reception area. I would hate to think how the elderly would cope.

"“Horrendous. Visit the Bar, But Stay Somewhere Else” This run-down, badly-operated hotel charges more than $450 a night for truly horrible service. Tourists and businesspersons alike should steer clear. Yes, the bar is trendy, and I certainly recommend coming in for a drink--and then fleeing the dank, unkind environs for one of dozens of New York hotels providing decent service and amenities at Hudson rates.
If you stay here, you should expect even the most basic requests to go unmet, including:
(1) A quiet room. The first five floors of the hotel pulsate with music until the bar closes at 3 AM. And yes, the hotel's midtown location is nice, but sirens on 57th Street are audible all the way to your bedroom, and staff will refuse a polite request to move you to a reasonably quiet room.
(2) Hot water in the shower. I stood in cold showers on three of the six mornings I was at this hotel. ""Maintenance"" efforts included coming to my room and leaving the water on for hours at a time, hoping that it would warm up. The staff moved my room three times without apology or compensation.
(3) Reliable internet or fax. An urgent fax sat at the front desk for hours, and the manager was puzzled that this bothered me. The in-room wireless shuts off at random at least once an hour. It's also $10 a day, and that's before they inevitably overcharge you: I was at the hotel for only six days but was charged $90 for access.
(4) Reliable wake-up calls. The front desk called me at the right time on about three of my six days. On the rest, they didn't call at all or called an hour early. If you stay here, set an alarm.
(5) Timely room service. The front desk's mantra is that they have ""nothing to do with the restuarant or bar,"" because both are run by another company. As a result, should your room service order be delayed, cold, or wrong (mine were, variously, all three), expect nothing from the front desk--even though the hotel will charge you a $10 delivery fee.
(6) Redress of complaints. I've stayed at hundreds of hotels over the years, and all of the above have gone wrong for me before. (Albeit rarely all at once, and never at these rates.) Still, for $450 a night you might think that you would get a sympathetic and competent ear to help you. Think again. The Hudson's staff is almost defiantly unhelpful. All of these complaints were met with disinterest rather than regret; the front desk manager literally shrugged when I described the above experiences.
At bottom, if you stay at this hotel you should expect that basic requests will not be met, and that the staff will not care. If you are a tourist, this may simply deprive you of sleep; if you are traveling on business, the inconveniences can be professionally disastrous.
If, like me, you have visited the bar or restaurant and found them trendy and fun and are thus tempted to stay here, save yourself the trouble. The bar is great, and you should certainly visit the restuarant as well, but do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere. For these rates, you can enjoy New York's trendiest locales and, believe it or not, still get a decent night's sleep--so long as you drink at the Hudson and stay somewhere else.",AnonyGuest14,2007-10-01,223023,2007-11-05,False,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

Check-in hall was very dark to imitate some kind of medieval castle. That was not for my liking.

"“Don't be afraid! Stay at the Hudson!” Got the Hudson for $100 a night via Priceline (hey, it's January in NYC). I came away knowing I'd give them a great review on TripAdvisor because I think the place gets a bum rap here. After reading reviews here I was concerned, but the reviews actually helped me a lot as far as setting expectations goes. 
Front desk staff were exceedingly friendly and happily checked me in several hours early since my room was ready (yay). No attitude about me having booked through Priceline at all, which was something others have mentioned. I found the lobby and all the public areas VERY groovy and interesting! I did not find the hallways to be shabby or not well-maintained at all, they were just fine. Dark, of course, but not dirty or any of the other stuff folks have mentioned.
And yes, the room was extremely small - I believe it was approx 18 feet from the door to the wall behind the bed, slightly less wide - there is maybe a foot of wiggle room on either side of the bed. More than 1 person in the smallest room would be nearly unbearable in my opinion. 
Somehow I lucked out and had an actual wall between the center of the room and the shower. I didn't find that the shower curtain stuck to me while showering (lol). Nice Korres toiletries too. The bathroom was just the slightest bit...icky, the ceiling and showerhead looked like they could use a little work but for $100 a night I could hardly complain!
The bed was super comfy, but was indeed low to the floor. Not an issue for me. Even though I was on the 19th floor I could hear street noise so definitely bring earplugs to ensure a good night's rest. This is par for the course in New York so it really did not bother me. The heating pipes clicked and clacked a little when the heater fired up but again, nothing I couldn't handle and it died down quickly.
I did not go to any of the bars/restaurants at the Hudson because the prices are just outrageous. Hang a left out the front door and have breakfast at The Flame Diner on 9th Ave - it's a classic NY diner that ain't fancy, but the food's good and breakfast was less than $10 every day for me! The Belgian waffles are amazing, try one. :-) The coffee is great too. If you're a Starbucks fan, hang a right out the hotel door and it's just steps away.
There's also a giant shopping mall inside the CNN building just down the block, on Columbus Circle. All manner of chain stores plus a small Dean & Deluca foods-to-go area and even a Whole Foods in the basement! Subway of course is available at 59th St/Columbus Circle and you're just steps away from Central Park South.
Clientele was mostly young Euros using the hotel as a base. They all seemed happy enough to be in such a groovy place. I did see a few bewildered older folks, as in elderly (lol) and a couple of business travelers but overall the crowd skewed young. 
No probs at checkout, no phantom charges, and they gave me a keypass to use the PC in the business center to print out my boarding pass - just ask nicely and I'm sure you can do the same.
All in all, I would stay here again in a heartbeat for $100/night. If I paid $358/night (the going rate) or even $200 a night for the Hudson I'd probably have wanted to die or (kill someone) when I saw the room size and I'd probably pick severely at every aspect of the hotel. If you normally stay in 4-star digs then stay away because you will be disappointed/upset.

"“Nothing Small About Our Room!” After reading reviews on this site of the small size of the rooms I was somewhat apprehensive about staying at the Hudson. 
Myself and a friend had booked a 4 night stay in a 'double double' and I can honestly say my fears were completely unfounded. The room was spacious for NY with chic fixtures and fittings that are to be expected of the edgy hotel. 
The location as others have commented is excellent and for people watching (maybe not the quality of music) the Hudson Bar is well worth a visit. Also check out the Sky Terrace on the fifteenth floor for it's great city views.
I can recommend the Flame Diner which is straight ahead of you when turning left out of the hotel. It's cheap and excellent for those great NY breakfasts.
For a funky eating experience try Sushi Samba (ask the concierge). This restaurant serves a Japanese / South American fusion menu and the cocktails are great.",bumpnhustle,2007-10-01,223023,2007-10-28,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Trendy Hotel” I booked this hotel through priceline and read the mixed reviews before I got there, so I wasn't expecting much. 
I was pleasantly surprised, this is not like any other hotel I've been before. The lobby is actually in the second floor, very nice and everything very well designed, from the elevators to the bathrooms and common areas. The bedrooms are indeed small but not bad if you are planning to stay a day or two. The staff was very friendly and kept our bags after we checked out at 12pm so we could continue with our tour in new york for the rest of the day.
If you are planning to have drinks at the bar, be ready to spend around $20 per drink (including tip). I stayed there Monday and Tuesday and it wasn't noisy to the point it was uncomfortable. Lots of people coming in and out, mostly a young crowd.",MarcoIV,2007-10-01,223023,2007-10-26,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“We enjoyed the hotel but some words of caution” Much of what needs to be said about this hotel has been said in other reviews so I will just cover any differentiating factors in my experience and emphasize some main points.
I was there is December right before xmas for a little holiday fun. We had two of our three kids with us- two boys one is 13 and the other is a college student at university. I travel on business to NY so I am familiar with the city etc but this was strictly pleasure.
Location is a huge plus:
The hotel is extremely centrally located which was wonderful for exploring midtown/theater district /5th AVe etc as well as next to the Columbus Circle subway entrace (by which you can go anywhere you want for $2 on the subway. 
Staff:
Staff was extremely courteous, Amy at the front desk went to school at UCSB and we chatted about that. She upgraded our room for a very reasonable fee ( will get to that in a minute). Michael at the door was equally personable. The hotel staff definitely is composed of young hipsters but from check in, to bag storage, to the restaurant/bar, I did not uncover one attitude or any rudeness whatsoever. One front desk clerk was more than happy to hunt down a matchbook for my son who was starting a collection. 
Room Size:
Yes it is very small for a standard room but well configured and well lit. You should note that the standard room comes only with a queen bed. So, if you are two friends planning on sharing a room, or two growing boys etc, this is obviously not ideal. Which brings me to my next point. They upgraded one of our rooms upon request and for $90 to a double deluxe which was very comfortable , I would say even large by NYC standards. My sons stayed in that room with two double beds. We got the room on price line for $150 so even with the upgrade, it was quite reasonable. I would not be happy at all to pay upward of $400 for the standard room. For me, that would not have worked. Otherwise rooms fine, clean, bed comfortable etc. We didnt spend alot of time in our room. If you are there on business, the standard may be too small to actually work and if you are planning on meeting someone there, dont do it in a standard room. NO room whatsoever, the surroundings are intimate. 
Words of caution/things to note:
Hotel lobby is extremely dark, I kid you not about this one. Your eyes literally adjust when you get up the escalator. They are going for some type of atmosphere/ feeling concept etc. So be prepared and if you are not a ""young 50"" or younger, you may want to rethink this unless you are in the art/design/fashion business, then you will probably get the whole thing, We liked it. I am 42, my husband is 54. Not a problem for us. Our kids were thrilled with the swanky atmosphere. The techno music they play one of the nights in the bar is annoying but that is minor and comes from an outside group that uses the space.
Restaurant/Bar-
Very pricey. My son had dinner with a friend there and said the food was fine in the ""cafeteria"" but he thought overpriced, hey this is NY. I went to the library. Again, I loved the space /concept, may not be for everyone. I found it to be warm and inviting but $20 for a glass of wine seemed outrageious, even by NY standards. And they would not let my son in who is 13 which seemed kind of odd given it is not a bar but more a public spot that one can get a drink as well.
The area on top was closed and I was disappointed not to see that as I am sure it would be worth a trip up there during the spring/summer.
One other note, the heating was up way too high in the hallways near the rooms. It felt like you were in a furnace room but we didnt mention that because we didnt stay in the hotel that long much less in the hallways for any period of time.
All in all, it was a very good stay.",loralei33,2008-12-01,223023,2009-01-13,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great start, bad end, never go back” We loved the look of this hotel and knew that the rooms were going to be small after reading reviews, but the area and price were too good to pass up. The hotel is definitely different, but a fun vibe for young people. We had the weirdest and most unprofessional thing happen at the end of our trip though, so we will never go back. Upon looking for the room hairdryer one night and not being able to find it we had to call down for another. It was not until the next morning when I was packing to check out that I found the hairdryer stuffed into nearly the bottom of my suitcase. Our room had been cleaned while we were out the previous day, so I can only assume that the cleaner put it in there. When we told the front desk this, they took all of the information, seemed serious about it and helped us check out. We had to call back 3 times in order to find out what happened (from Canada) and they dismissed us like we were the crazy ones. On top of that, the front desk girl told us, as we were going out sight seeing for the remainder of our day, that after we had checked out that we would not be charged anymore valet time. This was apparently untrue as I received an extra day valet charge for having been in the parking garage during the time the front desk said we could be. They need to get their people straight. If you want to classify yourselves as an upscale hotel, then act like it when customers have issues with some pretty big things. They could not have cared less that one of their staff went through our bags.",doubleeee,2008-07-01,223023,2009-01-13,False,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Small room,small bath....” Got this room thru priceline-it was the best available for the price I was aiming for.
Was very surprised about how small this room really was.I have seen reviews of other hotels that Ive stayed and people saying they were small.Well they havent stayed at the Hudson to know what small really is!Bed was near the floor and not much space to put your luggage if there are two people.Didnt like the bathroom because of the glass wall-shower curtain separating the bath from the bedroom.Also when your in the shower the curtains tend to blow inward so less space in the shower.Also the way the sink is designed there is really no wher to put your stuff when getting ready.On the upside nice bath items to use.Loved the soaps!
Not to far from Times Square but if your with a senior citizen like I was,we needed to take a taxi back and forth because it was to long or her to walk.The doormen were very quick in getting us Taxi's though.No long wait.
The hotel had very good security as on the weekend we were asked to show our keys before getting on the elevator.Lobby was very nice but a little dark as were the halls getting to the room.
I would go back to this hotel only if I was by myself or was able to get a larger room.But if you like being in close quarters with someone you wouldnt mind the rooms.

"“poor quality - way too expensive” Tiny rooms - paid $500 a night - for a room that just fits a bed; had to crawl over the toilet bowl to get into the shower

"“They went for trendy and forgot about SPACE!” CAUTION: Read the other reviews on TripAdvisor before booking this hotel. The rooms are TINY (no joke), almost in a creepy, claustrophobic, jail cell kind of way.
Yes, I must admit, the walls are made of beautiful imported wood, the lighting is what they would call ""stylish,"" and the public areas of the hotel are ""the places to be seen.""
Couple of notes:
- The bathroom is SMALL. Seriously. Sitting on the toilet your knees almost touch the wall (depending on how tall you are).
- The bathtub is tiny too.
- Drainage in the sink wasn't that great.
- The toiletries are nice (and in trendy packaging). 
- The air conditioner is really LOUD (but blocks out all street noise).
- I concluded that weird looking fixture on the wall (you'll see what I mean) was an ashtray.
- The tv is in the closet and about 13"" screen size (TINY also!!).
- The iron board is TINY too (good luck trying to iron wrinkled pants).
Make sure to check out the rooftop bar (closes at 10pm) -- nice views, but EXPENSIVE drinks ($20-25/ea). The Hudson bar is happening...VERY VERY loud/club scene on Friday and Saturday nights, so be prepared for loud noise if checking in on those nights. The library bar is neat (has a pool table in it). The outdoor patio area is beautiful also on a nice night (closes at 11pm).
Basically, if you're traveling single and on business for 1-2 nights, this hotel is manageable. Any more than that (I stayed for 4 nights), and it's time to shift to the Marriot. I don't see the point in staying here for $450+, when you can get many more conveniences at another hotel for the same rate. Unfortunately, I was stuck here on business.
Oh, and good luck finding the hotel (most cabbies seem to know where it is though). No name outside. No number. Take a good look at the pics on the website so you can recognize it. Also, be prepared for a lot of neon-ish green lighting wherever you go.

"“No water; cold room and even colder service!” YIKES! I checked in with 2 friends the evening of Oct. 11th. We were pleased to hear that we had been upgraded to a larger room...but then shocked to hear that it was because there was no hot water in the hotel. Over the next few days we had sporadic hot water in the shower. We had no water pressure in the sink--the cold water was dripping from the faucet! We had to wash our hands and brush our teeth in the shower! We called down to the front desk numerous times to complain. The maintenance staff and hotel manager would not return our phone calls. They finally responded and fixed the faucet on Sunday, the day before we checked out.
Our room was freezing, too. We called down to the front desk only to learn that the room heaters are not turned on until it drops below 50 degrees outside. Seriously?! My two friends slept in their winter coats!!
The customer service was unbelievably poor. I will not stay there again, ever. This was one of my worst hotel stays.",Oliver02,2007-10-01,223023,2007-10-24,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great Hotel” Hi,
I stayed in the Hudson with my husband for my 30th birthday, 7th of Jan - 11th. On arrival it was exactly the same as the reviews, i.e. the lobby and the lighting, I would however say that the staff were very friendly, we were given our room keys straight away, staying on the 23rd floor. My first impression of the room, was it was slightly, I mean slightly, bigger then expected. The prices of the food, drink and everything else as per previous reviews is way too expensive, which is a pity, but it makes you go outside a lot, an example we bought 2 drinks, 1 cocktail + 1 bottle of beer, total inc tip $27 in the Hudson Bar, and in a very high end Rest, Olive Garden, a big glass of lovely wine was $7 per glass and beers around the same, and the Olive Garden is in the middle of Times Square. 
The Bed was very comfy, and the room was spotless, the shower head was as per previous reviews a little stained looking and I felt for such an arty hotel, you would expect really high end fittings, but it was fine. The only other problem was the noise of the plumping... every time someone in the room next to you used either the shower or toilet, the pipes made some really weird and loud noises. I think also the senser on the TV is so sensitive that if someone else changes their channel, yours will change also.. ours switched by itself a few times. 
I would stay there again, because it looked so nice and the location was excellent, and of course a comfy bed, but only if I got a good deal. 
Loved NYC.

"“Buyer Beware” We visited NYC over the Christmas Holiday and booked our hotel through Priceline. Because I had read many online reviews, I was prepared for a VERY SMALL room. The room size met expectations. We bid 170 dollars for the room and with taxes & fees, we paid about 200 a night. Priceline rates this place with 3 and a half stars; shame on Priceline...I expected more with this rating.
Upon check-in, we requested a non-smoking room on an upper level. The staff accommodated. We had been warned through reviews that if you are on a lower floor it can be noisy because of 
the bar below. When we called ahead of time with these requests, we were told that we had to call Priceline...saying that usually you call the hotel directly, but in the case of the Hudson, you call Priceline. Priceline was required to tell us that such requests (a non-smoking room & upper level floor might mean additional charges!!) They did not. When we requested an upgrade to a king size bed at check-in, we were told it would cost an extra 60 dollars a night; we declined. We thought our bed would be a double, but thankfully it was a queen; no extra charge! The bed in this very small room was very low to the floor, presenting a challenge getting out of it. The room safe was level with the floor, requiring that you get down flat on the floor to use it. It was a challenge opening luggage, but I managed to put a couple of decoartive barrels together to serve as a luggage stand. There was a rack for the other bag.
Please do not stay here if you expect to sleep at night...the steam pipes creaked and crackled every time the heat came on. I asked if the engineer could check this and was told that the building was SO OLD that it was impossible to stop the noise. The technicians checked it anyway and nothing changed. I solved the problem somewhat, by running the fan continuously so I would not be awakened every time the heat came on. It was very cold in NYC during our stay so the heat came on regularly.
There is absolutely no sign outside indicating that you are approaching the Hudson Hotel (we were walking from the subway stop;) you had better know the exact address with exact numbers or you will pass it by. The escalator takes you up to a dark hotel lobby, rather depressing...the hotel room corridors are very dark and narrow and downright dangerous.
The bathroom was small but it worked; there were a few small shelves for toilettries. Only once did I have to kill a cockroach crawling in the tub.
I was charged for an item from the mini bar which I did not take; I called later when I discovered the charge and the billing office removed it with no argument. It had not appeared on the bill under the door at the morning of chek-out. We had a deposit of 35 dollars per umbrella (we used two) placed on our bill in case we did not return them. We did!
The hotel has a great location, near Columbus Circle, subway stations, (we never took a cab...) Starbucks, cafes for breakfast, a large mall, called The Time Warner, (I think.)The concierges were VERY HELPFUL. Thorough, friendly.
We would not return to the Hudson Hotel. When friends ask us where we stayed, we are embarrassed to say...by chance, they are familiar with the place!",khmoriarty41,2008-12-01,223023,2009-01-11,False,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Darkest hotel with the smallest room ever!” The Hudson Hotel is supposedly chic, but we found it only to be seriously overpriced for the smallest room we have ever stayed in--too small for two average-sized people to pass by each other. The ""ambience"" of this hotel may be suitable for ghouls and goths, but definitely not for a 60-ish couple who appreciate light and space. I actually walked into a glass door because of the oppressively dark surroundings! There was literally no public space in the hotel with enough light that I could easily read a newspaper. The only chair in our room was an uncomfortable cold metal one. The room itself was nothing more than a bed with a 15-18"" floor space around it. In fact I had difficulty getting out of the foot-high bed without hitting my head on the wall-mounted TV above it. Our experience in the Hudson is enough to convince us not to continue to use Priceline.com. Priceline should not allow the Hudson to pick up bids from middle-aged customers in their ""name your own price"" deal. We'll not chance being burned again as we were this time. The only redeeming features of the Hudson are location and a friendly young staff, who were unfailingly courteous.

"“great location - good hotel” i work in a travel agaent so had admired the look of this hotel from afar when i suddently got the chance to go with a friend. ive been to new york before and know the area quite well and this hotel has an excellent location. 
The taxi found it no problem and when we arrived it was late at night and the the hotel was buzzing with people in and out of the hudson bar. The bar is definately worth the visit, the ceiling pictures are fab and although the drinks are a little on the pricey side they make up for it in the size!!
You have colombus underground station almost opposite for the tube around nyc and times square is 15mins walk, 5th avenue 10mins if that.
The rooms are on the small side even by ny standards but they are stylish and comfortable for the amount of time you spend in them with flat screen tv and ipod docks, the only thing it lacks is a wardrobe with doors.

"“A Mismatch in Design” I had tickets to the Met so focused on Central Park South using Priceline. The price I got was a very attractive $135/night for me and my wife. I consider myself a fairly sophisticated traveler with worldwide experience. And despite the rate of $135/night I assumed the three star rating would be for an average size room. Wrong! I expect the small size of the rooms should cause the rating to be reduced as my interpretation of a three star rating is for a room much larger than I received. The ""mismatch"" description refers to the small size of the room but with amenities you might expect from a four star property: paneled walls, way above average (funky) lighting fixtures, bath fixtures way above average for the sink but a single electrical outlet on the wall opposite the sink (if you have a short cord on a razor, hair dryer, etc, make sure you bring an extension cord).
What I resent most of all were the packaged ""gifts"" which, once opened were charged to your room. The small warning that the ""gifts"" were for sale was easily overlooked. A package of two CD's is one example which I opened before seeing the warning. The price was $30. I complained to the front desk and the charge was removed. The hallways in the hotel are very narrow and the obvious design was to see how many rooms could be carved out of the given space. 
I would stay here again if the room was used only for the bed. But if I had work to do in the room, it would have been too small to tolerate for more than two days. In fact the desk at the foot of the bed was very small with no convenient electrical outlet for a laptop. This hotel would not be a repeat for me and my wife unless the rate was similarly discounted to other options. The difficulty, of course, is that I used Priceline and could not review the hotel prior to making an evaluation. The hotel’s web site touts this hotel as one of the most luxurious hotels in New York City.

"“Not My cup of Tea” My initial thoughts on arrival at the hotel were that although unusual the frontage was strangely atractive but was looking a little tired. This continued on inbto the hotel, the escalators had broken down and the green paintwork was heavily marked and looked somewhat dirty. A short trip in the lift took my wife and I up to a very dark reception with a ceiling covered with ivy and some interesting lighting and impresive chandeliers, on booking in we requested a room upgrade and were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room. A trip up in the lift took us to a dark and dingy looking corridor with strange lighting, the paintwork was tired and the carpets had seen better days. The ""upgraded"" room way very, very small, to put this in perspective it was without doubt the smallest room I have ever had in a hotel in my travels. The low bed and mirrors were intent on creating the illusion of space but not even this could make the room feel any bigger than a shoe box. In the morning we upgraded the room further to a suite, at a cost of $90 a night. After an interesting breakfast in the ""school hall"" set out of the breakfast room. We went up to the suit to find a slightly larger room with a slightly larger bathroom, this room was no more than an average sized room and with the extra cost was a very expensive average room. The bags had also not been moved from our other room and after requesting this happen a further 2 times i got the bags myself with my old keycard i had fortunately kept hold of. The best thing about the hotel was the location and a very Funky bar, although the cost of drinks in the bar made this a one visit bar.",TonyAFC8,2008-11-01,223023,2009-01-04,False,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“There is better in NYC” I must echo the sentiments of the other reviewers. This is a trendy, boutique hotel. It was once a YMCA and SOR. I don't think they changed the interior lay out since then. First the good...restaurant is nice, not overly priced, good food. They have a counter that goes around the chef's stations. It was nice. There is an indoor and an outdoor bar. Very happening singles spot, the bar was very crowded for a Wednesday evening so I can't imagine what it's like on the weekend. Be prepared for $15 plus for an average glass of wine. 
The bad...the room is the smallest I've ever been in and I travel frequently for both business and pleasure. Although it was clean and the ameities were comfortable, I cannot see how anyone larger than I (I am about 5'1"" and average weight) could fit in the bathroom.
I was given a corporate rate at $289 per night and that was still to omuch for this.

"“If you want a sink with water don't stay here!” I read the reviews and thought ""It can't be that bad"" -- well it was. Overall the room was small but VERY clean and comfy. It IS very loud. So loud that on Friday night I had to hand the receptionist my ID to get my room because there was no way to actually hear her or for her to hear me. The staff were friendly.

"“Need to improve some of the basics” Very hip design. Lighting literally as dark as a nightclub. So, it looks good.
The wall between the shower and the bedroom is glass, so you can see the bed from the shower and vice versa. This might be fun in the right circumstances, or it might be just weird. (I was alone on business, so not an issue for me.) 
Room very small, especially the bathroom. Bed very comfortable. Air con pretty noisy, and located right behind your pillow, but it drowned out traffic noise and corridor noise so I slept well, even though I was trying to stay on UK time so I went to sleep at 8pm.
Tap for the hand basin had no water pressure, so the best you got was a dribble of water. The shower pressure was fine, but it created some sort of air vortex, which whipped the flimsy shower curtain up like a flag in the wind. Magnets had been sewn into the curtain to try to hold it to the bath, but were not powerful enough to do the job. The water was only luke warm.

"“Hipster heaven or my version of ...?” The most expensive and least comfortable hotel I have ever stayed in and I travel a lot. The Hudson is painfully trendy, so if that is what you seek - be their guest. If you want comfort and good sleep, look again. The rooms are miniscule, even by NY standards- about 18 "" from bed to wall. No desk, but a hip, tiny table and chair. Very dim florescent lighting - hard to put on make-up well. Anyone over 5'5"" will have to sit sideways on the commode or knees will hit the wall. No coffeemaker. My room had a tiny TV whose volume wasn't loud enough to be heard over the very loud AC unit, located behind the headboard. The toilet flushed itself about once a minute. The shower (no tub) drain was very slow, so I had to shower fast or risk an overflow. The bed was not the worst, only the second worst I have every had. The hall lights are very low.

“horrible hudson” This was the single worst hotel experience we have ever had. It was a though the Hudson was doing us a favor by letting us stay there.

"“Good staff, location, style in a shoe box.” Visually this is a good looking hotel. All the communal areas look the part. The rooms are indeed very small, but if you are just staying for a weekend and do not intend to spend all day in the room 
it should be a problem. Whilst small the rooms are very well designed and of a high quality. We had problems with the water pressure and friends also staying complained of brown water. Our room was on the 12th and overlooked 58th and was quite noisy, but 
most places in the city are noisy if you face the street. 
Contrary to other reviews I found the staff excellent. From the front desk, consierge, maids and bell boys, they were all very helpful polite and friendly. 
I liked the location as its so close to the park and Columbus Circle station.

"“I also say...Stay Away.” I (attempted) to stay at this hotel this week. I arrived in the evening from a SFO-JFK flight, where I received a cold reception at the front desk. The Hudson is a swingin' singles kinda hotel so I can deal with the cold shoulder and rude reception staff.
The first room I was given would have been fine had it not been....occupied. The guests in that room were as surprised as I was. The next room I was given was also right next to the air-con units and it was FREEEZING cold inside the room. Realizing that even a deaf polar bear would have trouble sleeping in the room I marched back down to the front desk and was given my third room in 20 minutes. This room seemed fine - an upgrade, as it were, to a deluxe studio. I unpacked my things and went out for dinner. 
Upon my return I decided to have a nice warm shower only to discover there was no water. At all - cold or hot. None. A call to the front desk revealed they are having major water problems and there is nowhere to move me to; they promised to send engineering. 
At 10 p.m. engineering arrived and continued to BANG ON THE PIPES for close to two hours. I believe they were trying to lull me into sleep with music. I went out the next morning for Starbucks and went by the front desk to inquire about the water situation only to be rudely confronted. I should mention that I was calm and collected the whole time - I am not one to raise my voice.
The rude girl at the front desk just said, ""yea we're full and we're having problems with the water. What do you want us to do about it?"" 
""I want a shower,"" I replied.
""What's your heritage? Are you French?""
""No.""
""Oh, bummer. I was going to suggest a French shower. It's my last day on the job here and I'm only doing them a favor because of the water boiler exploding, so I really don't care."" Another guest then walked up and dropped off a key and they exchanged profane words; she got the final word in, not to be outdone by her guest, by saying something along the lines of ""I'm so d*m* glad it's my last day here so I don't have to deal with you people AGAIN!""
This sent me off. I'm in NYC for business, I don't have time to waste with childishness and games and profanity. All I want is a SHOWER. I demand she speak with a manager to resolve the situation. In the end, I was given two towels, moved temporarily to a room that had been vacated but not yet made up to take a shower, then promised yet another room (my FIFTH in 12 hours at this point) that afternoon at 4 p.m.
I moved my things to the fourth room, showered, called Priceline with whom I'd booked the hotel and explained to them the situation. They called the hotel on my behalf; when they finished, the agent came back on the line and confirmed what I had told them, and said she was surprised by how the hotel had treated her.
They refunded my whole stay but the VP at the hotel informed the Priceline agent I had only 30 minutes to pack my things and check out, or I'd be charged for two night's stay. 
I'll end the story there because I did check out (within my 30 minutes alloted time) and spent the next night at another nice hotel nearby. 
But be warned about the Hudson - they really do not care about their guests. Like the previous reviewer, it's the staff that make this place so horrible. Yea the rooms are like closets and the windows single-pane and the whole place a little too hip for it's own good, but all of the staff I dealt with - including the VP - were beyond callous. I find that inexcusable, beyond reproach. Never an apology from anyone, just attitude and carelessness.

"“Stay Away” The Hotel looks really nice on the website but when you arrive it is like a dark bar but that is not the problem. I called ahead and asked for a double room, I was promised by the assistant manager that I will have it but when I got there they had a single for me - so they upgraded me to a bigger room with a roll away bed which the promised to comp but appeared on the bill at the end, After one night there was no hot water in the shower and no water in the sink, I asked to move, more correct - begged to move since the staff is as unfriendly as you can imagine, I was moved to a room next to the main AC units where even a deaf person would not be able to sleep :-) - I asked to return to my old room and was yelled at by the front desk that they already gave my room (10 minutes later) the bell boy that assisted my with my move told me that there is a major water issue in the hotel and half the rooms have water problems.
to summarize - although the rooms are nice and clean - hot water is a basic not only at this price range and the unwillingness of the staff to try and help is a deal breaker in my book",RB1212,2007-10-01,223023,2007-10-17,False,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Dissapointing - beautiful hotel, the rudest staff ever!!” This hotel is prefect for people with more money than sense!
Behind the great location and beautiful interior is a small, overpriced, over hyped hotel with what can only de described as possibly the worse service i've ever experienced at a hotel in my life.
If you want a great experience at the Hudson - or simply sit in the chair that was featured in Sex and the city - then avoid sleeping there and simply go to the bar or the main resturant - its gorgeous!!
OUR STORY!!
We chose the Hudson for our first trip to NYC after saving for 18 months. we chose the larger double room as we'd been told the standards are tiny.
we were greated (or not) by an unenthusiastic lady who didnt make eye contact or conversation througout our checkin. she gave us a room which was next to the generator.. so loud that I had to raise my voice to speak to my boyfriend.. i wouldnt have normally asked but we asked for a room change as we needed sleep after a long flight. the lady at reception said 'you'll get a smaller room if you change!!' but at this point i was so tired I didnt care I just said 'ok thats fine!' - very rude when you think that I paid extra for a larger one!
the new room was nice. very cool, very trendy.. clean and big enough to fit our suitcases in.. i was happy at last. (pillows and sheets are devine!!) 
we would ask for our travelers cheques to be changed to dollars and they'd make you feel like you're making them go out of your way.... so rude!!
everything was fine until we woke up on the 4th of our 5th night with ants crawling all over me.. i was like 'OMG how did they get in our room on the 14th floor??' we called room service and they sent the cleaning lady who said 'im very sorry, we have never seen this before in the whole time ive worked here!' we need to investigate it so please can you pack and we'll get you a new room.. so we were taken to a double room (it was massive!!). instead of waiting around we continued sight seeing and when we arrived back to the hotel we went to see the manager at the desk. she was awful and when we said 'What are you going to do? dont you think we deserve some form of compensation for finding ants in our stuff and us losing a whole morning of our holiday? she simply said 'we dont know how they got there.. we're investigating it.. what do you want me to do about it?' she must have thought we'd dome it dilliberatly or something cos of her tone.. so insetad of arguing with someone who didnt want to help we asked to speak to the main manager.... 
the main manager took us to her office and was extreemly appologetic. she appologised for the staff being unhelpful and assured us again that this was an isolated case. we didnt get money off (apparently this isnt part of the procedures) but we did get a free nights stay to be used within 12 months - which never got used as its not like i'd ever go to NYV for one night LOL
The whole ant thing was a joke - so badly delt with.

"“Great for x-gen not for baby-boomers” booked one night through Priceline at $250 and later learned I probably could have got it cheaper. 
Pluses are: clean, modern rooms and great location in mid-town. Price
is good if you book on Hotwire or Priceline. Also the nightlife in the bars and lobby is very active (this is also a minus)
Negatives are: very tiny rooms, a bathroom that is smaller than most
RV bathrooms, very dark hallways, lobby area is dark and has constant
music blaring, elevators have the same music blaring. My wife and I (both in our early sixties) arrived on a Friday night around 8. The lobby and bars were packed with nice-looking ladies and men in their 30's and the music was loud. If you want a place with that - this is the place for you. You'll probably have a great time checking out the
eye-candy. If you're like my wife and I, this probably isn't the atmosphere you'll enjoy. I'm sure the hotel did not decorate and market their bars and lobby for sixty-year olds so I have no problem and no complaint - just be aware.
I would stay again just because of the location and low price. If I can get a room for under $200, and I know the room will be clean, I would go there again knowing the room would be very small, the music would be loud, the hallways would be dark but it would be VERY convenient to mid-town.",pinguy,2007-10-01,223023,2007-10-12,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Small but great room” I got this hotel through Hotwire and stayed over Columbus day weekend. As it had mixed reviews in Trip Advisor, even though hotwire advertised it as a 3.5 star one, I was expecting a 2 star really crappy old hotel for the price I paid for. I was really pleasantly surprised about the quality of the hotel. 
Make sure you look at the photos of the hotel online, as the hotel doesn't have its name/number outside, so I recognized it by the photo I saw on their website.
The hotel is half block away from 58 St-Columbus circle metro, so location is, then, great. we almost didn't use the metro, as we were walking distance from Times Square and Central Park.
The room is, in fact, small. We stayed in a room with a queen size bed, and all room we got on the sides was the same width of the night tables. The only space I found a little bit unconfortable was the toilet space, that even for me (5.1) was not as easy to sit down. But that did not take any pleasure away from us. The rooms are nicely decorated and clean. 
I guess the hotel is struggling the best they can with the limited room space they have. All staff we found surprisingly friendly. I even requested a late checkout, which I had at no cost. 
I would definitely stay there again, even if I have to pay a higher rate than the deal I got. I would also recommend it to my friends as well.",laifu,2007-10-01,223023,2007-10-10,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

We changed room twice due to level of noise around us and the fact that the bedroom was smaller than my bathroom at home. A total rip off. Do not waste your money.

"“What a great terrace!!” Just returned from 3 nights at 'The Hudson'. Positives to begin with! 
 Good location, near central park and a lovely mall which has some great bars, including a jazz lounge. Extemely clean and modern hotel. It dosen't really look like a hotel from outside as there isn't a grand lobby, just lifts up to reception. Once you go up the lifts it has the wow factor! Three great bars, two being on the first floor. One very modern with a glass floor and later on loud music and dancing which we felt was more for the teeny boppers and didn't go in. The other is very chilled and swish. It is outside,lovely furnishings, very sexy waitresses in chinese style robes with rather large splits up the sides!! (much to the fellows delight!) Our favourite was the roof top bar, great ambience and fab views at night. The room was very clean and modern.
Negatives were the entrance as mentioned above. A few nice potted trees and you have said all. The hotel is very dark inside, the lobby, the hallways and the rooms. You may love this or hate it. I thought it gave a nice feel to the lobby but brighter hallways and a room would be good. The rooms are teeny tiny! We thought it was just ours and complained but was told 60% are this size and we heard somebody else talking about it in the lift! My husband is six foot and found it difficult to sit on the loo as there isn't enough room for your legs! It is basically just a bed in a dark modern room. Bar and tv etc are built in the wall and they don't do drawers!! So our underwear etc stayed in the case! Rather odd. They have hanging space as you walk in and a shelf above it which is ok if you are tall for t-shirts etc.

"“Mixed bag” The Hudson is a mixed bag. I agree with some of the positive and most of the negative reviews on the property. I stayed at the Hudson for a week while on business ...maybe if I had been on vacation I would feel different.
The positives:
1. The bed (although only about 6 inches off the ground) was comfortable
2. Good quality toiletries in the bathroom
3. Excellent food (had the Lamb Shank - wonderful)
4. The 15th floor roof top garden 
5. My room was clean (although the hallways were trashed)
The negatives
1. The noise. The rooms are essentially above a night club. Every night there is throbbing music coming from the outdoor lobby bar and indoor dance floor. I was on the 7th floor facing the bar and was kept awake by the noise until after midnight. I am not a light sleeper by any means and I am used to sleeping in NYC hotels that are not renowned for their quietness. My bed was vibrating slightly from the blaring base. Again, maybe if I didn't have to get up early for a business meeting this wouldn't have bothered me but being kept up until after midnight and getting up at 5am killed me by the end of the week. My colleague was on the 9th floor and had the same problem. She called the desk to beg to be moved to a higher floor - they couldn't accommodate her but brought her complimentary ear-plugs.
2. The tiny rooms - although I knew the room were itty-bitty teeny-weeny little things, you can't imagine how small the rooms are until you experience them. I bumped my knees on the wall everytime I had to use the toilet. I didn't have enough room to unpack a week's worth of clothing and other bits and pieces of travel gear. When I checked in and first saw my room, I didn't think it was so bad, but by the end of the week I felt like I was in a coffin. Again - if I were on vacation and out and about playing in NYC maybe I wouldn't care but I had to work in my room and it wasn't pleasant.
3. Darkness - I can only sum it up this way...I knew I was in trouble when I saw a man use the light on his ipod to illuminate his watch to see what time it was. Ok for midnight but this was the middle of the day, in the Lobby!!! The mood lighting was okay for a while but by the end of the week, darn it, I just wanted to be able to see what I was doing!
4. Moldy smell. I was in room 744 and when I would take a shower, the room would get steamy and smell damp for the rest of the evening. Given how tiny the rooms are its not hard to steam up the room (5 minutes in the shower!) I didn't see any mold but could smell it. There were 4 of us in my group and we all had the same problem with the smell.
The Hudson was on my company's list as an approved business hotel but given our experiences last week the hotel will be removed from the list. I have been traveling for the company for 7 years and have never felt that a property was so inappropriate for business travel. We live and learn! The Hudson has very little to offer the business traveler and is better suited to those looking for a unique experience in a boutique hotel. It is also better suited to smokers and those who keep late hours and enjoy loud music. In moment of frustration after I bumped my head or knees for the 10th time, I might say that if you are over 3 feet tall, you may want to look elsewhere too given how small the rooms are.
Miscellaneous Notes:
1. The 15th floor garden is supposed to close at 10:00pm. Every night of my stay they closed it early. This is the only quiet place in the hotel so this was disappointing.
2. The hallways are dark, dirty and seedy looking.
3. I left some jewelry in the safe in my room (I know, I know, I'm an idiot!) and so far I have called 3 times, left my call back number three time and have not gotten a call back. Pretty indicative of their guest service - there really isn't any to speak of.
4. For $589 a night, it was a disappointment. Maybe for $99 a night it would be ok...
Given the number of wonderful hotels in NYC, there is no need to endure small, dark, moldy rooms in a hotel that can't decide if it is indeed a hotel or a night club.

"“Swanky, chic place. Horrible service, and ridiculous hotel rooms.” This hotel is definitely ""cool"" and fun to admire if you're NOT a guest. The decor is different, designed by Philippe Stark.

I'm only 5'1"" and I got several bruises from running into things because there's no space. The rooms are about 150 sq feet. With the bed in the middle, there is about 1.5 feet of walking space on each side. Then a tiny washroom, and a smidgen of space to store a luggage. Not even enough room to open up your luggage. The A/C is very loud, and the rooms are not sound proof. You can hear the music playing at the Hudson Bar below, even up on floor 15. On 2 separate nights, we called down to the front desk 7 times and did not get an answer. We finally had to go downstairs to inform them the drain was clogged in the washroom. We asked them 3x to fix it, and no one ever came. Finally at 2am, we requested a room change. They provided a luggage cart to transport our belongings, but offered NO ASSISTANCE! The employee merely watched us pack up, load up the cart, and move it ourselves to the next floor, despite our belongings constantly falling off the cart. No apology, no offer to upgrade, nothing.

room at a corporate rate of $419 was not suitable--very small. I
upgraded x2 for a higher price only to find a cockroach in the bathroom. I realize there are likely cockroaches in many hotels; however, if we see them, then that tells me they are not kept under control.
Also, I could smell pot coming from the service elevator. Your hallways
are way too dark--likely to hide the fact that there are cockroaches. I
will not be recommending this hotel to others who travel on business to
NY. I should mentioned, that the front desk staff were very
accommodating my not charging me a cancellation fee for cancelling my
second night stay. The lobby and restaurant was nicely Decorated.",Kazza31,2007-09-01,223023,2007-09-26,False,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hudson is Priced Right” I just stayed (9/21-9/25 2007) at the Hudson and was pleasantly suprised. I read many reviews and they were all over the map. However, this hotel is quite chic/trendy and in a great location(near subway, starbucks, central park). My room was the smallest hotel room I'd ever stayed in, but my wife/i survived. We are relatively tall and our only noticeble issue may have been when using the restroom. We had two suticases & one carry-on. The closet is average in size. We had a comfortable queen size bed. We did not have a dresser. Bathroom was tight (one user at a time). Daily maid service was perfect. TV was a 19''. The entry, outdoor restaurant/bar, indoor bar/club were all first class w/trendy crowd. The a/c is located at head of bed. If you are a lite sleeper, you may have some issues w/that. We did not. In the end, we would stay here again w/o hesitation. 
Side note: our last night, paparazzi was hanging outside the hotel. We had not seen any celebrities. However, later found out that Paris Hilton was attending a private party at the indoor bar/club.",rolltideroll123,2007-09-01,223023,2007-09-26,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“All Image, No Substance” We got a ""deal"" on this place on Hotwire. First the good parts: The common areas are very nice. It is the place to stay if you want to hang out at your hotel drinking and clubbing. The terrace bar is large with a view of the hudson river but the drinks are VERY expensive (by new york standards). The Hudson Bar was packed by young, chic people. Guest of the hotel do not have to wait in line which is nice if you are into it. The elevators are quick. Bath products were nice Korres brand from Greece. Front desk staff was friendly. 
The downside: 
The rooms are closets. It is hard to fit two people in the rooms. The air quality was poor. It was difficult to hear the TV over the air conditioner. The hallways are creapy and nasty...gray walls with gray carpet with little yellow lights above room doors. You could see stains on the carpet. I felt uncomfortable int he hallways...way too dark. My husband got food poisoning from room service and then wa s heckled by a security thug (which the place is stocked with). I complained about being hassled by security when my husband was sick and they still insisted they only use ""fresh products"" (this after we had to go to hospital). Eventually they attempted to be nice and brought my husband gatorade, sodas, and broth.

"“Pleasant surprise!” We booked the Hudson through Hotwire so we were unsure of what we would be getting until after we paid for it. We were a little nervous at first because our rate was so low for NYC (just $159 including all taxes). The standard rate is $319 + taxes which may be a little high for what you get, but for $159 we were pleasantly surprised! 
The rooms were small but offered a desk and closet area with a luggage rack. If you want a large room in NYC you will be paying close to $600. If you want a clean place to sleep with a great location the Hudson is perfect for you. 
The outdoor terrace on the 15th floor was awesome!

"“High Kudos” I have now stayed at the Hudson twice, both booked through Priceline. When I found I was staying there again, I was overjoyed.
While the Hudson is very trendy, it is also a wonderful hotel because of the location, the decor and quiet rooms. It is located within walking distance of Lincoln Center, Fifth Avenue and Central Park. It has a lot of rooms so the staff can help if you want to upgrade. You arrive and there is no sign. You travel up a steep escalator to a cavernous lobby decorated with vines growing to the tall ceiling. Behind the lobby is an outdoor bar/restaurant and another indoor restaurant. On the other side of the lobby is the indoor bar/disco. To the side is a large ""library"" which is quieter, has a pool table and a fireplace and internet access as well as bar facilities.
For the standard room, you pay a bit much because the rooms are beautifully decorated but tiny. Both times we stayed we asked the staff to upgrade us and they did a great job. This time the hotel was a bit busy but the receptionist searched and found us a perfect room, a bit larger and very quiet. Plus she was very friendly, chatting with us about our vacation and sharing experiences.
Overall, I think it is a great find. If you are into the trend scene (I'm not), there is a lot of that. But if you are not into that, you can simply sit in the lobby or the library and watch people. Plus the location cannot be beat.

"“Form over function” Where do I begin ? When we arrived at the Hudson on Sunday afternoon, my first thoughts were that the reception area seemed very dark. With mood lighting everywhere, you can never tell if it's day time or night time. The airconditioning vent in our room was located by the headboard of one our beds, so you really can't get a goodnight sleep if the AC is turned on. It's hard to understand how the Hudson can be rated a 4* hotel with none of the basic amenenites you would expect in a 3*. There was no tea and coffee making facility, the closet space was tiny, the music sytem had a cassett player (how ancient is that), and the TV reception was awful. We asked for a room with a view and boy, did we regret that. The noise from the NYC traffic kept us up for most of the night until we finally plucked up the courage to ask for a different room. Surely it's not too much to expect the windows to be double glazed. In my opinion, don't stay at the Hudson unless you're keen to impress everyone but yourself. There are better hotels in NYC which offer a much more confortable and cheaper stay than the Hudson.

"“Hip, cozy comfort - LOVED IT!!!” I absolutely loved this hotel. I wish every hotel had the character and class that this one exudes. However, this is definitely not the first choice for every one. The rooms are extremely small – this is true. But – I loved it. I didn’t come to NY to spend the day or night in my hotel room. I need a comfortable bed with fine linens, and I definitely had that. Bare essentials are met in the very small bathroom – and I think the glass shower wall that connects the bathroom to the bedroom is sexy! Walking into the room with its kind-of cruise-ship stateroom feel – the mahogany walls, the white sheers – offset with some chrome furniture and aluminum blinds, felt dreamy. The designers were going for something different, and I totally got it. Even my larger-than-life very traditional Texan husband got it and loved it. This is a boutique hotel. If you want ordinary, go to the Hyatt or elsewhere, but for something truly unique, the Hudson has it all. Fabulous rooftop bar with lovely waitress in a white bikini and sheer blouse. Fabulous “library” which is really a bar with art and interesting coffee table books displayed for your leisure. The Hudson bar off the lobby is one of the hottest places to be in the city right now. At 1 AM the escalator leading from the nearly unmarked hotel entrance to the atrium lobby was buzzing with pretty young Prada-clad things – and the bass was booming. We worried that we’d be bothered with noise, but our room was completely quiet. The staff was very helpful and never seemed overwhelmed. The whole mood there just put us at ease. If you are claustrophobic or prefer boring – stay off Broadway at the Millenium. If you want hip, unique, and cozy comfort – stay at the Hudson.

"“OK if you're a troglodyte” My husband and I recently spent five nights at this hotel. It has a very good location, being close to Central Park, shops and the theatre district. It also has a beautiful roof terrace with fab views. Have to say though that, for us, these were the only good things.
We had a standard double room and it was tiny (although hats off to the designer who has managed to squeeze everything into such a small space). This was ok until you tried to use the bathroom where you had to step over the toilet to reach the shower and couldn't sit on the loo unless you sat sideways - certainly never had that experience in a hotel before!
Have to say, I'm only 5'5"" so if anyone tall had stayed there, I don't know how they would have managed.
The reception area, restaurant, lifts and corridors were designed to be dark and cave-like so everytime you went into the hotel from the sunshine outside you needed night vision goggles - I'm not exaggerating (well not much). The designers had gone to town, with quirky fittings and trendy bars but hardly any of it was comfortable. 
We only ate breakfast there once because the restaurant was so dark you couldn't see what you were eating (although it was good, but expensive). Instead, we took a short stroll down the road to a little cafe which had a huge range of breakfast options for a fraction of the price (sorry can't remember it's name).
The staff were ok until we tried to drink a bottle of champagne (purchased from the hotel) on the roof terrace before we left (it was our anniversary). They initially told us we couldn't do this as we hadn't purchased it from the roof terrace bar and it would have to be consumed in our room. They made a huge fuss when we explained we were about to leave for our flight home, it was our anniversary etc, and the manager had to be phoned to give us special permission to drink the champagne which had been purchased at an exorbitant cost from their own bar.
This hotel is probably ok for you if you are young and like trendy, designer places to stay (and you're under 5' 4"".). But if you're middle-aged, with not-perfect eye-sight, give it a wide berth.",JaneyL,2007-08-01,223023,2007-09-09,False,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“someone forgot it's a hotel - not a lobby” The Hudson is breathtaking from the moment you walk in. The illuminated escalator, the striking wood lobby, the futuristic bar contrasted with the courtyard that makes you feel as if you’re at a sophisticated friend’s cocktail party. The lobby and common areas are as impressive and beautiful as they look on the website, but once you step out of the dark, slow elevator to your room the fantasy ends. I stay at the Hudson when I’m in NYC because my company gets a ridiculously low rate and guests get to skip the line to get into the bar – a nice perk for entertaining clients. However when friends seem impressed I am staying there, I steer them away. I like to describe the Hudson as the most expensive hostel you’ll ever visit. The hallways are dark mazes with stained carpets. The rooms, while cleverly designed, are the sort better viewed as artworks in a design magazine than actually lived in. There are no drawers or floor space for a suitcase. Unless you plan on unpacking your toiletries to the shelves in the bathroom and hanging your clothes, you will be cramped. The toiletries are awesome, but the shower is a tiny stall, one wall of which is a window to the bed. There is a curtain if you want to avoid giving your bedmate a full view while showering or using the toilet. This means that 2 wet curtains will blow and stick to you while showering. The paneling is peeling off the walls. The beds are awful. I had thought they were merely mediocre until I spent the weekend with there with my boyfriend. One person can roll around, 2 people will roll to the middle and find no comfort. I used to think the lobby was worth it. Never again. It might not be as hip to name check the Westin or Marriott, but a good night’s sleep is worth waiting in a bar line.

"“There's subdued lighting and then there's ""Where the [--] is the door?""” This place doesn't know whether it wants to be a hotel or a nightclub. We arrived late at night, knackered, to a hotel with no visible signage and thumping bass pouring out of the neon lit door. After checking the map twice (is this really the place?) we ventured up an escalator, seriously planning for the scenario of being spat out onto a dance floor. With no small sense of relief, through the gloom, what appeared to be a reception desk could just about be made out. After shouting our details at the receptionist over the music, we made our way to our room (with the music following us - even in the elevator). So far so bad, however, it is this next point that would prevent me recommending this hotel to anyone; at the Hudson a request for a non-smoking room is only that, a request. Upon opening the door to our room we were presented with a space that had the approximate dimensions and aroma of a small ashtray. Reception regretfully informed us the hotel was full and that we could only be moved the next day. Well it was a pretty disgusting night. The bedding reeked, and my girlfriend woke coughing during the night. There were lots of other niggles: blocked sinks, room doors that required a ""special knack"" to open them, mini bar charges for items not consumed, bell hops that failed to deliver things when promised. In each case staff were apologetic, courteous and helpful, but you can't get over the fact that this hotel has some systemic problems and is preoccupied with being ""edgy"" instead of efficient. On the plus side, the breakfast is pretty good and the room they eventually moved us to was nice enough.

Bad Side : Dark, very dark ! Even the reception at night times is so dark, you hardly can read your invoice. Small rooms - unbelievable how they managed to get everything into such small space, they must have their own furniture maker. Don't drink anything on the terrace or in the library - they charge you $9 for a small beer. And skip the ""In-Bar"" - loud !!!

"“Great place for hip night owls, not so good for families.” This hotel was $359/night which is high but seemed to be the going rate for a decent room in August. The hotel lobby is very beautiful, staff at the front desk was pleasant and the large patio off the lobby is a very nice place to have a drink. The large, outdoor sky terrace on the 15th floor was beautiful also, but I was a bit annoyed when they asked me to dispose of my coffee as soon as I got there, even though I was just checking it out. You can only drink something you've purchased at their bar. As we expected from the reviews, the rooms were very small but that was okay. I liked that they had dark wood laminate flooring instead of carpet and a washable duvet cover. I would not recommend the Hudson if you're looking for a quiet room. We could clearly hear people on the patio and lots of traffic noise, even with the windows closed. Our main complaint was the shower stall. The curtain wasn't long enough so water spilled all over the small bathroom floor. We ended up wasting lots of towels cleaning it all up. Overall, I'd say this place is hip and modern and a great place to stay if you're young, not going to be spending a lot of time in the room or you're going to be going to the Hudson bar at night. The location's good too. I would stay again if I got a great deal, but if you can get a place like the Parker Meridien, where I stayed a few years ago, for the same money, I'd stay there, just because the rooms are bigger and quieter, and maybe even a bit cleaner.

"“all style, no space ( or light)” Firstly, let me say that there are a lot of good things about this hotel.........the staff are actually very decent,the sky terrace (open until 10) is very impressive,the breakfast is pretty sumptious,the rooms are well thought out for such a tiny space,the ac works a treat,there are vending and ice machines on each floor to save paying minibar( forgive me,mini basket)prices.
However,the combination of a lack of room space ( just me in a ""double"" room),the extremely low lighting thoughout the hotel,and the general uptightness of a hotel trying to be ubercool made this one of the more claustrophobic travelling experiences ..
.The sad pretentiousness of not putting a name sign in front of the hotel,the trip on the escalator that leads up to the dimly lit lobby ,the rooms that made me think Houdini had it easy; all little things that started to grate until I actually dreaded going back.Only for it was a business trip with others,I would have bolted for a a hotel that would have offered a more relaxed environment.

Bed was low to the ground - no place for our luggage - bathroom was tiny (let's just say you could shower, use the toilet and brush your teeth simultaneously it was so small.

"“Extremely Noisy! Tiny Rooms!” I love staying in stylish, boutique hotels, and Ian Schrager and Phillipe Starck always deliver the style. Unfortunately, The Hudson Hotel is beautiful, but terrifically loud. The rooms are also very small.
I should point out that I've rated my overall experience as 'Okay, but some problems'. That is because the design of the hotel is exquisite. The lobby, restaurant, and bar were all hip, playful, and out of the ordinary. My room had hardwood floors, beautiful, modernist wood paneling on the walls and cool furniture. If my experience had ended there, I would've rated it a 5 (excellent). Unfortunately, an uncomfortable bed, excessive noise and a staff that seemed uncaring knocked the rating down considerably.
The first night of my stay I climbed into a bed that was decidedly uncomfortable. I should point out that I normally sleep on a platform bed with a very firm mattress. Most hotel beds feel cushy to me. But not the one in my room at The Hudson! It felt similar to what you would expect from a fold-out bed in a sleeper sofa. It seemed to have no padding whatsoever and was rather uncomfortable. Also, the sheets were a scratchy poly/cotton blend which surprised me as I expected a hotel of this caliber would have all cotton sheets.
The next morning, I awoke with a startle to the sound of someone opening and closing the door to my room. This went on several times over the course of the next hour. I finally realized it was the sound of my neighbors going into and coming out of their rooms. They weren't slamming their doors. They were simply opening and closing them in a normal fashion. And every time someone opened/closed the door to their room, it sounded EXACTLY like someone opening and closing the door to MY room. It was very disconcerting and completely interfered with my sleep. I also heard car horns and sirens much more clearly than I would have expected given that I was on the ninth floor. At one point I tried to increase the speed of the fan on the A/C unit hoping that it would create white noise to drown out the noise from the street. Instead, the increased speed of the fan simply caused a rattling noise in the A/C. (Another note about the A/C is that it never seemed to get the room quite cool enough. That's a bummer when it's 100 degrees and humid outside.)
The rooms at The Hudson are famously small. All my friends who heard I was staying at The Hudson immediately said, ""Is your room tiny?"". Indeed, I thought it was. But when the bellman was helping me get settled into my room he asked me how I liked it. I said, ""Well, it sure is cozy!"". He responded by saying ""This is actually one of the larger rooms in the hotel."" In fact, the room was so small I didn't feel as though I had a great deal of privacy. Given the size of the room and the poor soundproofing anyone in the hallway could have heard anything I said or did in the room. Let's just say it was good that I was travelling alone.
On the second day that I was there, I heard glass breaking just outside my door. A few minutes later, a friend entered the room and that's when I saw that someone had damaged a light fixture just above my door and tiny shards of glass were all over the carpet. And of course, my friend tracked the glass into my room. I called housekeeping, explained that there was broken glass in the hallway and just inside the door of my room. When I returned several hours later, the glass had been removed from the hallway, but not from inside my room. After calling again, the glass was finally removed from inside my room. 
When I checked out I had to return my wireless internet device to the concierge desk. When she asked how I enjoyed my stay I told her that in all honesty the room was so noisy I found it difficult to sleep. Her only response was to say ""Wow. That's too bad."" 
Then I approached the front desk to check out. I explained to the clerk that I had never requested a reduction in the price of a hotel room before, but that I was unable to sleep due to the noise and would appreciate some reduction in room rate. He smirked in an exceedingly smug way and said I'd have to speak to the manager. He disappeared to find the manager. He took so long returning that I became concerned that the driver picking me up for my ride to the airport was having to wait for me. So, I simply gave up and left the hotel.
I would recommend The Hudson only to those who are so obsessed with interior design that the beauty of the rooms and the public spaces would outweigh the fact that the rooms are tiny and noisy.",hip_hotels_4_me,2007-07-01,223023,2007-08-03,False,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hudson was good” We stayed in Hudson from July 17th to 24th.
We got a very goode rate 122 $/night from Hotwire, I could find elsewhere only one star hotels in worse locations for the same price... and were quite sure hotel would be Hudson before we purchased. (If you don't know what Hotwire is about, check [--]).
Hudsis only a block away from Columbus Circle subway sattion and shops. We found it well, even though there are no signs outside the hotel.
Check in was fast, my previous e-mail request for non smoking, quiet room had been noted and we got room 1720 on 17th floor. 
Room was tiny, but quite cleverly laid out. We are tall people, but we and our big luggage (and all the shopping we brought in the room during next wk) fit in the room well. We hang most of our clothes and t-shirts we placed on the shelf.
We could sit on the toilet without out knees touching the opposite wall, had enough space to turn around in the shower/tub and could place our toiletry bags and my make up bag on the shelves.
This hotel is not people who want everything super sized, are scared of the dim hallways, want to spend theri time in hotel room want a big tv-screen... but we liked it; our room had all we needed for New York, where hotel room is basically for sleeping, it was clean and the location was very good. We don’t spend much time in the hotel anyway. Here we even tried the hotel bars, which we usually never do. These bars were quite fun and trendy, so we had few (quite expensive) drinks in the hotel bars.
Staff was friendly always when we needed help. Only the guards by the elevator weren't always very pleasant when they asked to see hotel keys before entering the elevator.
Remember to visit the sky terrrace on 15th floor.
Check before booking [--] before booking, they have room plans, pictures, room sizes etc. clearly listed and decide if the room size is big enough for your needs, to us it was.",Tuuli,2007-07-01,223023,2007-07-31,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Rooms just too small” Third time staying at the Hudson, this time we opted for a suite. Its definitely not worth upgrading to a larger room, as the rooms are badly designed, regardless of the price you pay, the bathrooms are ridiculously small....knees on the wall. After asking to move room we were moved to the 23rd floor, we encountered some more problems...tv that was not tuned in, poor water pressure, it took me over 20 minutes to run a bath, bathroom still same size as in standard room. 
Last two times we stayed the common areas...the bars etc made up for the shortfalls in the room, however this time the bar had more of a nightclub feel, seemed to go from trendy to tacky!

"“I won't be back” I stayed at the Hudson this July for a week and paid $209.00 per night. It was group rate associated with a local university within walking distance. This was my second time staying at the Hudson, and decided to return due to the convenience of the location. Overall, the novely of the submarine type room wore off this second time around. The bed was so hard that sleeping was a problem. My air-conditioner barely worked and engineering said it had to be cleaned. Never was an alternative offered and moving to another room never seemed to be an alternative. I should have pushed--my fault for that. Depending on the house-keeper of the day, it ranged in cleaniness. I always had to call for extra towels, and that was a drag because that was an extra tip.
When I first stayed at the hotel, I thought it was unique. The ivy covered lobby and outdoor bar appeared to be elegant and hip. However, I actually inspected the ""ivy"" this trip, only to find that the crawling ivy is plastic! My illusion was shattered. Oh well, I understand the difficulties of keeping so much ivy healthy, but after I figured it out it just seemed cheesy. The service in the bar is absolutely horrible. My friend and I kept being asked to move because we did not have a reservation for a seat. We left in frustration.
Forget getting help with your luggage or help from the front desk. I had to wait for my luggage over an hour because my travel associates all arrived at the same time. ALL of our luggage was collected from the cab and stored for us because the rooms were not ready. Only one ticket was given for over 10 bags, even though we were all on different floors. When I mentioned this to the desk clerk, he was so sarcastic, saying that they were capable of handling such a problem and that I would have to wait. Well wait we all did until I got so angry, I went to the basement to search for the luggage myself. I had to point it out and insist it be delivered. What a night mare after a long plane ride. 
I could go on. My advice is that the Hudson is okay to bad. Trendy but pretentious. I will not stay there again. And if you do...don't expect to get internet. It's 10 bucks a day and the connection is weak.",corazontx,2007-07-01,223023,2007-07-28,False,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“OK For Some.....But Not Me” I would only recommend this hotel to people who actually don't plan to spend any time in their room when they come to NYC. If you're looking for trendy, stylish, shoebox sized rooms then this is your place. Me, I like to have enough room to spread my arms without hitting the walls and ceiling, or sit on the toilet without having my knees hit the wall of the bathroom, but that's just me. Oh, there was also a laughable attempt at a TV in the lone closet (which, funnily enough, was able to fit a small mini-bar).
To the hotel's credit, the rooms were clean and there was a nice woman at the front desk who switched my room when I discovered my first one had a broken toilet and also printed out my boarding passes. It was also pretty close to Times Square so if you were there to do some sightseeing it would be a good location.
I was staying here on a business trip so I didn't really have much choice as my employer picked this place out, but in the future I would probably stay elsewhere. Apparently this is one of the trendiest new nightspots in the city so if you' re looking for a hotel with a good nightclub this is your place.",novaj,2007-06-01,223023,2007-07-26,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“No attitude is a great attitude!!” Stayed at the Hudson Jun2 2007 for 10 days with friend. After first night we upgraded to larger room (for a really reasonable extra amount that was actually left off my bill in the end..along with the wifi). The staff were really accomodating with the request to get a batter room. I had to call back a few times to make sure that I was getting moved, and had to move my bags myself, but in the end I was stoked not to be in the insanely small room.
Hip boutiques usually have attitude commensurate with aesthetics. HOWEVER....The Hudson is a real exception in that the staff are unusually friendly and helpful, with ZERO attitude...especially impressive for a hip boutique. So, gold star!
The rooms are silly-small. The bigger rooms (270 sq ft or something) are just fine -- not spacious, but NY style. The 136 and 150 sq ft rooms are laughable, even for NY ( I mean, that includes the BATHROOM). It's like being in an RV. Don't be fooled by the photos, they have some kind of mini-furniture that is 2/3 scale. The bed is comfy tho, and the linens great.
Note if you have a silly small room, be stoked with any free/cheap upgrade to anything ending in a XX17 -- that seems to be a 'big room' that is too small to be sold as a big room (there is a service elevator or something that cuts off what would otherwise be a big room.
The room service is tasty and not expensive, for room service.

"“Small but fabulous!” Yes it is true! The rooms are the size of those on a cruise ship. But I must say... who cares. I didn't come to NYC to lay around in my hotel room. It was cozy and comfortable and that is really all that matters.
The staff was very friendlt. We stored our luggage when we arrived at 8:30 am Friday morning. Returned to the hotel around 4:30pm to check in. We were told they would bring our bags up. Well an hour later... no bags and we are running shor on time for our evening plans. I called the bell stand and Daniel said that he was very sorry and he would call right back with details. He did call back within one minute and our bags arrived 2 minutes later. He apologized over and over again. Not a big deal and we were greatful they cared.
Love the Garden bar. BEWARE...a rum and coke is $12 and a beer $9. We quickly learned this is the case a lot of places in NYC. The prices are just insane but that didn't stop us from partaking in the cocktails. The hudson bar is very trendy and VERY loud. We never went because we would not have been able to hear each other speak.
Overall, loved this hotel. We booked it on Priceline for $120 a night and it was an absolute steal!!!",Ziggy96,2007-07-01,223023,2007-07-25,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

When I called, they said they would remove the charge, but implied that it's not possible to be charged for a movie without ordering it. I completely understand this, but I didn't order it.

"“If you want to stay in a Nightclub!” If you like the type of boutique hotels, then this might be for you, but this hotel was not for me!
First of all the entrance is very stange, there is no sign to say that this is a hotel, so you would walk past it and you wouldn't know what it was! The doorman that took our cases had no ID/badge so we didn't even know if he worked there or if he was going to steal our luggage!
Check in was no good either, because we were on our honeymoon we asked for an upgrade, the receptionist agreed, but said she didn't have the room ready yet and did we mind waiting? We were OK with this as were getting an upgrade, however if we had known that we would have to wait over 2 hours then may not have bothered. The thing was that she said because one of the lights was out in the room she would have to let an engineer go and check it out before we could go in the room. Anyway after 2 hours we still hadn't got our room, so went up to reception and they agreed we could check into our room, but told us there would be someone coming up to fix the light. But for the whole 5 night stay the light was never fixed, so we wasted over 2 hours for no reason! Not happy!
I did not like the dark lighting throughout the hotel, it was like a nightclub and the music in the lift was very stange. 
The worse thing was the hotel bar, the bad attitude of the serving staff really got up my nose and you could only sit in certain seats if you ordered the most expensive drinks on the menu, what a load of rubbish, it wasn't even busy. I was not going to tip them after their rudeness!
So overall would not recommend this hotel. The rooms are very small. We had a 'studio' room and you couldn't swing a cat in it! The staff were either rude or unhelpful. One good thing was the Conceierge they had really good knowledge about the city, but that was about it! i am sure there are much better hotels in New York.",jojo75,2007-07-01,223023,2007-07-24,False,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Lively hotel in excellent location” Returned from a weeks stay at the Hudson in new york with my boyfriend. Was nearly rebooking another hotel following some of the awful remarks we had read about this hotel!!!
We arrived at the hotel by super shuttle from the airport it was about $30 and really easy to book at once in arrivals at the airport. The hotel looks like a trendy bar when you go up the escalators into the reception lobby. The staff were really friendly and we had our cases taken directly to our room.
The room is fairly small and the bathroom is tiny! BUT how long do you really want to stay in the hotel room for anyway! The bed was really comfortable and we were on the 10th floor and never had any problems with noise from the bars. The are a number of bars in the hotel and one of which on our last night had a VIP party in there, but as we were guests of the hotel we were allowed in. (They do great cosmos there too!!)
The location was great! right by columbus circle and the entrance to central park. It was about a 10 min walk to times square and the theatre district. 
Lots of restaurants around which were all really reasonably priced.

"“No one can deny the Hudson has some unique qualities” The Hudson is likely to get poor reviews as the rooms are unusually small. Thru my corporate travel agent I secured myself a 'double double' room for the price of a regular double - which was the same size as an mid-range average hotel in NYC. So if you're a traveller that likes to spend time in their room, chose somewhereelse.
However, no one can deny the rooms are unique, lots of plush wood, no carpets.
The hotel is very 'cool', to say the least. There's a very loud lobby area bar. The most unique part is the terrace bar on the 15th floor. Very unusual, like being on a very plush, expensive and LARGE apartment terrace in Manhattan. My martini was $15, but arguably worth it considering the specialness of this space.
Beware, room service ends at 11.30pm earlier in the week, but there is a diner at the end of the block (west of hotel)",nycmr,2007-06-01,223023,2007-07-19,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Big enough for us and a lot of fun!” I’ll be the first to admit that this isn’t the hotel for everybody… but I thought it was a really fun, cool place to stay. I felt really “immersed” in the hotel experience and the public areas were too cute for words. But the rooms are SMALL! So let’s get that out of the way right now. If you want a place where you can relax in your room, stay somewhere else!
As you approach this hotel on 58th Street, there is no sign. I had read reviews and looked at pictures so I knew that when I saw the trees and the funny yellow windows, I was probably in the right place. The subway station at Columbus Circle is about a block and a half away so not too bad even if you are lugging bags and such (as we were). When you enter the hotel, you go up a LONG escalator (very cool) to the lobby area. The lobby is very large and open and includes lots of greenery. Nice touch if you ask me. Check-in went well and we were ready to go up to our room.
When you get off the elevator, your eyes might have to adjust a bit as the hallways are very dark. No troubles for us, however once we got more used to it. Our room was, of course, way at the end of the hallway as seems to be our luck after long trips! Anyway, when you enter the “room”, you may be taken aback a bit! It is tiny. And I don’t mean “kindof small”. It was difficult to even get into the room as the entrance is totally narrow. But really it gives you everything you need in New York — a bed, a bathroom, and the noise of the city outside your window! The bed itself seemed to be of pretty good quality and was very comfy. After running around New York all day, you are going to sleep soundly no matter what you get!
The bathroom is even smaller than the room. You have to be a bit acrobatic to get around but you’ll make do. My 61-year old mother had no troubles once she got used to it. There is even a curtain if you want your companion to see you in the shower (although i’m not sure why). In any case, it was very modern looking and more importantly quite clean. Overall, I would say that even though the room was small, it was laid out quite well and sufficed just fine for our stay. Mom and I agreed that it was our favorite hotel of the trip (we stayed in three)!
So if you are looking for a nice place to lay your head, and don’t mind really cramped quarters, take a look at this hotel. It might not be “luxury” but it certainly is a lot of fun.",eobri,2006-12-01,223023,2007-07-18,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“C'mon, it not that bad....+” Having read a lot of the reviews prior to arriving at this hotel, I did not have high expectations. Ive read all about the loud banging noises from the pipes, the booming music from the nightclub, the tiny rooms...blah blah blah. My wife and I were dreading it expecting a five day stay in hell, but it wasnt that bad. Yes, the rooms are tiny, when you first walk in your room your knees will practically bang off the bottom of the bed, but now you know to expect that. For a couple, the rooms are small, but for a single person it would be all you need. The toilet was small but it was clean. The loud music wasnt that bad where we were on the 16th floor, you could hear some slight activity coming from the bar on the 15th floor but nothing to bother about. It is quite a trendy hotel though, if you are single then this hotel is the place to go, it was filled with a lot of good looking people dressed in designer gear. As you would expect the mini bar prices are high, $8.00 for a miniature Bombay Sapphire will give you some idea of what to expect. I bought a bottle of Peroni from the actual bar area and that set me back $9.00. Once you walk out the bar into the elevator the music even continues on playing in the elevator where you feel like you should be dancing in it whilst being crammed in alongside 6 people dressed up in Prada and Armani.

"“Nice, but soooo small!” I stayed at the Hudson with my husband for 6 nights at the beginning of July. I was pleased with the service, cleanliness, and location of
this hotel. I know all the reviews have mentioned how small this hotel is, and I would have to agree. We stayed in the standard queen bed room and were fortunate to get a a bathroom with a bathtub. Unless you're willing to pick up everything every morning so that housekeeping can even get to the bed or into the bathroom, this isn't
the place for you. While this hotel would be okay for a night or two,
there's just no room to spread out and relax at all. The TV is a tiny
corner unit inside a cabinet as well. I understand that no one comes to NY to stay in their room, but after a day of sightseeing and walking starting at 8 or 9 in the morning, you're ready to relax at least a couple of the nights. Also, getting a room higher up is a must if you want quiet. The disco/bar really starts to crank up the volume starting at 10:30/11:00PM and will continue through 1:30AM. We
stayed on the 16th floor and could still hear the crowd shout out occassionaly even with the air conditioner on.

"“Good and Bad at the Hudson” I stayed at the Hudson for two nights in June. I was a little ambivalent during my stay. There were some aspects of the hotel that were great and others that were abysmal.
The great- Location is perfect. Right by Central Park, across the street from the Columbus Circle subway station. The lobby and other common areas are spectacular. I especially loved the atrium. One beautiful night I went to the rooftop terrace, stretched out on one of the lounge chairs, and watched the sun set over the skyline. It was a wonderful setting. The rooms and bathrooms are very well designed.
The abysmal- The rooms are very well designed visually, but not so great to actually inhabit. There is absolutely no place to put your belongings. I have been in small hotel rooms before, but this hotel takes it to a whole new level. The hallways are very dark and it seems that no one clears out room service trays left outside the doors. Trying to maneuver down the dimly lit space while avoiding precariously balanced piles of dirty china was not a particularly enjoyable experience. Especially when the same trays were there at six o'clock at night that were there in the morning.
Overall, it wasn't a horrible experience, but I most likely would not stay here again. There are just too many other choices in New York.",essiedot,2007-06-01,223023,2007-07-10,False,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Unique, not for everyone” My husband and I had decided to stay one night in NYC after dropping our daughter at camp. It was very last minute and we got an amazing deal on Priceline. After being matched to the Hudson Hotel, we were thrilled when we checked out the hotel's website and saw how interesting and cool it looked. And, when we checked out room rates on the hotel's site, we had paid less than half of what the least expensive room cost. Which is an amazing deal in NYC!! I have paid more to stay in a Holiday Inn.
The standard room we got was TINY but thoughtfully designed with lots of unique touches. Yes, they were trying hard to be hip and sometimes you'd wonder about the idea behind some of the things. But, frankly, it was a refreshing change of pace for us - we live in a traditional antique colonial home - and so it was fun. Like staying in someone else's life for a night! I found the room to be very cozy in a good way - like a ship's cabin. But, granted, I was only staying for one night, had a tiny overnight bag, and was not making this my home base for a week of exploring NYC. The bed was low to the floor, with a firm mattress but still very comfortable. Down pillows & down comforter, plus nice pure white sheets, duvet, and bedding which is about a million times better than the usual scratchy, multi colored ugly patterned bedspreads you find in chains.
The bathroom was so small that it had us laughing. Really, it was MINISCULE. I have never seen such a small bathroom. If you are a big or tall person, you simply would be unable to use it. As it is, I am only 5 feet tall, and when I sat on the toilet my knees touched the wall in front of me. That said, it was immaculate and had very nice toiletries. Lighting was dim but manageable. The toilet was running continuously when we arrived but my husband fixed it and we had no other problems.
One of the shower's walls is glass and it opens into the bedroom so that you can see in the bedroom and someone can see you.
For privacy, there are sheer white curtains placed strategically around the bath & bedroom.
As for other people's complaints. We were on the 8th floor and the only noise we heard was the occasional horn honking outside. The staff was very professional. The hallways are in fact painted dark charcoal gray - top to bottom and are quite dim. Sets an interesting mood. As you are only in the halls for about 30 seconds, I didn't find it to be a problem. But, if I were a woman traveling alone, I could see it being a little creepy. Also, the elevator was about 100 degrees and it did have funky music playing at all hours.
The outdoor private bar/park space, the roof space and the library were simply amazing. Particularly the lush greenery on the two outdoor spaces. An oasis in the big city. It's truly memorable to have a drink on the cool patio space. But you pay for the experience with the astronically expensive drinks. We had 3 drinks total (1 beer and 2 cocktails) and with the tip the bill amounted to just under the cost of our room!!
All in all, Hudson is a unique place which for us was an unexpectedly fun, hip, stylish - and affordable - night in the city.

It is stunningly modern, has small but pristine rooms with many nice touches, a superb 15th floor terrace and a tasty canteen style restaurant which serve great food.
This was our second stay in the Hudson and paid the extra to stay in a Superior room, this is really worth it, the room was on the corner with stunning views over NYC.
The location of of the hotel is perfect with many subway stops in close proximity, enabling you to go anywhere easily.

"“Ignore the bad reviews” After reading all the bad reviews I was not looking forward to our stay. I could not have been more wrong! We had a wonderful time at the Hudson. All the staff, from the bell captains to the waiters at the lovely roof garden restaurant, were friendly and wonderful-especially to our 2 young children. The lobby and all the public areas are beautiful. Yes, the rooms are minute-we actually had to book 2 rooms through Priceline -but they were well executed-I compare them to a ship's cabin. The location was great-right near the subway and close to Central Park. We also loved being right by the most gorgeous Whole Foods and Jamba Juice. NYC hotel prices are ridiculous-and you also need to expect that the rooms are going to be small. I think a lot of the criticism is from unseasoned travelers.

"“Okay stay but some glitches” I stayed here as a result of a business trip (my company picked out the hotel for us, we all just showed up). I had heard from co workers who had stayed there previously that the rooms were small and noisy, but I didn't find that to be too much of a problem. I was close to the elevator but still didn't find it to be too noisy (although I'll admit I am used to the usual noise in city midrise apartment dwelling).
I was a little put off by the constant ""hipness"" until you get into your room - the elevators were always playing loud obnoxious music. 
I also found that the bathroom was a joke for any traveling woman who also wanted to look presentable in a city -- NO counter space for toiletries/cosmetics and I seriously thought that the light was not working when I first turned it on - it's so dim it's basically a night light.
For it being a hotel priding itself in hipness, I was a little surprised that the room had such a terrible little TV (like probably 14""), but I guess it encourages the guests to go check out the bars and restaurants at the hotel -- I loved the rooftop terrace, as well as the restaurant (delicious food!). 
My last complaints may be just circumstance, but on my last day I was too sick to check out on time, and the front desk manager was so nice and comped my late leave, but I suspect she felt bad because I was suffering from food poisoning from a nearby restaurant recommended by the concierge. She even offered to buy me some water from the nearby drugstore, because apparently NO vending machines are ever stocked in water. Also this same morning, the fire alarm kept going off and there was definitely some sort of fire because it smelled smoky and the fire dept. showed up. I was a little put off because the intercom just told us to stay in our rooms and when I looked outside my door it was smoky and the maids were just standing around looking concerned. I was staying on the top floor before penthouse, and seriously, if there was a fire I would've liked some chance to evacuate before I went up in flames...",bellagazer,2006-07-01,223023,2007-07-03,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Catastrophe!” The Hudson was a desaster! Dark, noisy, no service. We expected we might get into trouble after having read some reviews on trip advisor. To be honest: It got worse than expected. 
Being too consumed with trying to be stylish and hip, the hotels lacks just everything. There is no warmth, no friendliness, no customer service - which is way different from what we are used to around the world and especially in the US.
The floors are dark, the rooms tiny. But most of all it is loud. We were located on the 17th floor...and they had a party going on in the patio....until 2am. We could not sleep at all - which was pretty bad since I was ill at that time. Then we got phone calls from some other room... some lady insulting and threatening us. Ridiculous. When we tried to stop it ,addressing the front desk, they just smiled at us and said we should calm down. Everything would be under control. Well it felt like being in a night club - not a hotel.

"“Very pleasantly surprised!” When my husband and I first booked our five night stay at the Hudson hotel on hotwire.com, we were ecstatic... until we started reading reviews. We were very nervous about not fitting in with the ""hipness"" and club-like atmosphere, as that is really not our scene. I was also nervous about feeling claustrophobic in the shoebox sized rooms. 
BUT when we arrived, we were very very pleasantly surprised. There is not pounding music pouring out of everywhere, and the lobby is GORGEOUS. The bellmen were friendly, we checked in quickly, and the woman who checked us in was friendly as well.
We stayed on the 17th floor and even being there on a Saturday night, we heard nothing from the bar below, it was very quiet actually. We had a standard room and standard bed and were very comfortable- we had one large suitcase that fit on a suitcase stand between the wall and the bed with still enough room to walk by. Then our garment bag and other small suitcase fit well into the closet area. The room was very clean, our air conditioner worked VERY well. The bed was comfortable, the water pressure was amazing. We did not feel claustrophobic at all, never heard any noise from our neighbors or from the bar. 
We ate at the Hudson cafeteria one night and while it was pricey (we spent about $85), the food was excellent, service was great, and it was served very quickly!
I really had no complaints! The hallways are dim, but not in any way scary. I felt completely safe the entire time. The location of the hotel is excellent- right near a subway hub and a short trip from uptown or downtown. We loved it and would definitely stay there again! Don't know that I would pay 300 a night for it, but the price we got on hotwire was well worth it.
Only slight complaint- not much air conditioning in the elevators or hallways... but the elevators are very fast, even going up to the 17th floor took no more than a few minutes. Also once we asked the concierge for a nearby bakery and he could only think of Whole Foods across the street (a chain store we have here in TX).. but when we walked just down the street we found several on our own. :) Oh well, we had a travel book with us and didn't need his information anyway.",bethanyleann,2007-06-01,223023,2007-06-29,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“An Exciting Hotel” This dark and brooding hotel lived up to expectations and was an excellent choice for us. Initally we booked the double room but after reading reviews decided to upgrade to a double double room, which is twice the size of the very, very small standard rooms. As we had a lot of luggage there was no way we could have stored it in a standard room, but our upgraded room had 2 dble beds, ample storage, a modern well planned bathroom and was light and bright with filtered views of the Hudson River. Fabulous vine covered atrium lobby, friendly efficient staff, and a wonderful outdoor garden/bar, a little gem in the hear of New York. Tried the restaurant which was excellent, the open kitchen was good theatre. Located a couple of blocks from Central Park. The only downside was that the outdoor garden area was closed to guests for a private party on the Saturday, and the sofas in the Library bar were reserved on 2 of our 3 nights so we missed out on a couple of good experiences that should have been available to paying guests. The dark painted hallways and public areas and very low lighting is perhaps not everyones choice, but we didn't mind.",cruisegirlSydney,2007-06-01,223023,2007-06-27,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Fun, Trendy Hotel” Newsflash: This hotel is trendy. If the depiction of the entrance on the hotel's website irritates you in the slighest bit (meaning you are thinking ""what on earth is the deal with this entrance?"" as opposed to 'hmm...interesting. I've never seen an entrance like this before."") then obviate any future discomforts and just choose to stay at another hotel. 
The Hudson has teeny tiny hotel rooms designed mainly for sleeping because the designers figured that this hotel would be a destination for those who don't like to spend time in their rooms. That said, the hotel is in a perfect location just steps away from Columbus Circle/Central Park and is perfect for exploring what Manhattan has to offer. The concierge and staff were wonderful and had excellent suggestions for restaurants and nightlife. They took extra steps to place me and my friends on multiple guests lists and took care of all of our reservations. 
Focusing on the hotel itself again, the outdoor lounge visible through the large windows just behind the gorgeous reception area is tranquil during the daytime with plenty of cushioned lounge areas. In the evening, this areas purrs with an eclectic mix of people casually sipping cocktails. In addition, the bar is a landmark with it's reverse lighting and chair-back laden logs. The fresco on the ceiling is divine.

"“Adjectives for the Hudson: Cosy, Stylish, Econimical, SUPERBly CLEAN” Our stay the Hudson was FANTASTIC. Booking our hotel and flight on hotwire was a SUPER deal (better than staying at a low end motel by the airport) and we were WELL AWARE of the room size after looking at the photos posted online. 
So, another reminder to those who may choose to complain, when they have chosen to book a room:
Yes, the rooms are small, but NOT torturous, as some reviewers have felt. They are basically the size of your bedroom when you were growing up. And, we felt it was a cosy refuge to take a shower (FYI, THE best shower head I have ever had in a hotel…with a VAST pouring of water to wash the gunk of NYC away) and go to bed. 
One of the BEST parts:
The housekeeping was IMMACULATE. Truly, if we took one thing from our room (like the pencil) it was replaced. And, the wood floors make the rooms VERY cleanable. Great white sheets and detailed oriented cleaning staff made the rooms very luxurious.
How to work your small room:
When it comes to storage, I guess I’m a bit of a “survivor” candidate, but I put the “buyable” hotel items under the bed with our empty suitcases…and we used the closet for our hanging clothes and my significant other’s folded clothes. And, I used the t.v. closets’ 2 extra shelves for my foldable clothes. And, it was PERFECT.
Things you may choose to avoid:
We weren’t SUPER impressed with the Cafeteria restaurant, but it was worth a try. It was just EXTREMELY expensive for nothing with a “wow” factor. (I just ordered the soup: $12.00/bowl).
And, we never went into the bar, but weren’t bothered by any noise on the 14th floor.
Overall:
We really enjoyed the cosy feeling of the hotel. And, no, we are not UBER trendy OR cool, but no one seemed annoyed by us, and we just thought we were in a place with really cool foreign and local people. Why are reviewers so angry about that? It’s a VERY unique place to stay, for a budget price…and the quality of the service was VERY HIGH.",ashbyelkins,2007-05-01,223023,2007-06-20,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“This is a seriously Smart Trendy Hotel” Ok I had the pleasure of visiting this hotel this month for a four night stay in New York City. It wasn’t booked by myself and so had no impression on what was about to await me. All that I knew was that it was a sister hotel of the Sanderson in Bernard St London where I had enjoyed many a night and was part of the Morgan group who do tend to execute the hotel finish extremely well. The lobby is set above from the street giving you a real tranquil and private feel, there is plenty going on and the decor is traditionally quirky. There is a beautiful garden bar where you can enjoy many an afternoon or evening drink, The main restaurant which serves fantastic food, I personally recommend the ribs, the best I have ever had, also there is the Hudson bar which is open till a little later, great vibe, good music and nice crowd, it was right up my street. Seems to be a bit of a spot with the locals too reminding me just like the Long Bar at the Sanderson. The rooms I had heard where a little small, however we had a double and the size was no problem, plenty of room, 2 decent sized beds, separate bathroom, city views and entrance area with wardrobe, this hotel was scoring on all points. There is the traditional library room where you can read, relax or shoot a little pool, also enjoy a drink and take in some of the fantastic artwork. The service was extremely friendly, from the garden bar girls to the concierge and guys out the front. This is a seriously top hotel, perfect location, for a 26 year old male this hotel was all I could ask for and left the perfect impression for me and on the beautiful city they call NYC.

"“Great example of the worse kind of design hotels!” Nice location, great lobby and very nice restaurants and bars BUT... 
1. The rooms: I knew they were going to be tiny, and they really were... but that's not really the problem... it is the maintenance: lamps not working, dust, stains on the walls, etc... it is very likely that in a couple of years they will have a terribly worn-out look...
2. The worse in the hotel is without any doubt the service... some examples of the pitifull service are: doormen chatting among themselves or simply remaining idle while guests are trying to get through the entry doors carrying their luggages... no possibility to leave a message for another guest at the reception... arrogant concierge who makes it clear that printing a document for you is, to the hotel's standards, an exceptional and very painful favor... 
In conclusion, the Hudson is a great example of the worse kind of design hotels... the management of such hotels seem to think that having a trendy bar, restaurant, etc..., and rooms fitted sparsely with design furniture exempts them from providing adequate service and allows them to treat their guests with a snotty and arrogant attitude...",michelph,2007-06-01,223023,2007-06-18,False,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Yuk!!!” We just spent a most ghastly night at this hotel and wouldn't wish the experience on anyone. We had booked for several days but left early (even though we had prepaid). 
It does promise stylish design on the website, but that is about all it delievered. We were given a smoking room when we had booked a non smoking room. There was stale cigarette stench on the 5th floor and in the bedroom so it was difficult to breathe. The room was big enough to fit a bed and to allow guests to get into the bed, but that is about it.
When we asked for our room to be changed to non-smoking we were told that we had arrived too late, and that rooms were allocated on a first come first served basis. So it was a competition to see who could arrive by 3 p.m. and it was our fault! The person at reception was very rude, said there was nothing they could do making no attempt at reparations.
Calling down to reception was impossible because there was too much noise coming from the DJ. 
The hotel was very dirty in the common parts, the lifts need a good vacuum clean, although the room was acceptable. 
Except in the check in area and restaurant, the rest of the hotel was unbelievably dark and dingy. I felt I was in a tennament in communist Russia (albeit with a carpet). The room design itself was a nice idea, but again, badly executed.
This hotel is a nice idea, very badly executed. I could deal with the small rooms, the stale cigarette air and even the dirty communal areas, but such a low level of service is unpardonable.
Saying all that, if you can over look the above it has an NYC vibe to it.

The only problem is the size. I've been in small rooms before, even by NY standards, but nothing like this. I could barely fit in the bathroom and the main room wasn't much bigger than the bed. Another negative is parking, if you must drive. The website says it is $50 a night for valet and no more than one hundred yards down the street is a garage that charges half of that.

"“Great location, but that's about it” I recently stayed at The Hudson Hotel in NYC the night before I was to speak at a conference, and I am truly stretching to find much good to say about it. 
My usual hotel was sold out, and this was the next-closest to the conference site. I knew from my research on TripAdvisor that the rooms would be tiny, the hallways dark, and amenities few, but figured that it would be alright for one night. 
Unfortunately, it wasn't. The most bothersome aspect was that I was kept awake past midnight due to excessive noise from the bar in the courtyard a dozen stories below --levels that were clearly audible with windows shut, fan turned high, and television on. I had read about this in other reviews, yet was still surprised by the extreme level.
Other than the mattress, comfort was definitely lacking in my room. The safe was inconveniently located on a floor-level shelf of a cabinet, and wouldn't unlock after I had locked it. The service person I called actually scolded me for putting a laptop in there. The drinking glasses provided in the room were dirty and, therefore, unusable. The limited storage space was made even more limited as one shelf was taken up with Hudson items for sale (T-shirts, ball caps).
Most seriously, both my business colleague and I noticed that the evacuation map on the back of our doors was not an accurate depiction of the floor's layout. 
All of these issues were dismissed by the front desk upon checkout. (I'm about to notify the fire department of the evacuation map issue.) There were some other issues as well, although these were mere nuisances by comparison. 
The only positives I could come up with that was that the bed was very comfortable, and that the concierge was helpful when we asked about a restaurant at which we had dined months earlier but had forgotten the name. The hotel is also in a wonderful location. 
I would not recommend The Hudson to business travelers (minimal work area), those staying pre- or post-cruise (unless you spring for a suite -- standard rooms are 150 square feet, insufficient space for luggage), or early risers.",Frasier63,2007-05-01,223023,2007-06-03,False,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“horrible service + cramped room” The initial attraction to booking at this hotel was for the location and it's design. Before moving overseas, I was a resident of New York for just under 9 years but had never made it to the hotel bar which is very popular with the B&T crowd.
While the entry way and overall design is interesting enough, the actual stay was quite unpleasant. I had booked a double for my fiance and I, non-smoking, for several nights. We were placed on the 5th floor and we would later realize it was a smoking floor. The radiator was so loud that it was as if someone was hitting our door with a metal-pipe. Having lived in NY, I know what radiators sound like, but honestly, this noise was excessively loud. We requested to change rooms after the first night and the front desk was accommodating enough. This is when the smoking-status was confirmed as the receptionist asked if we would still like a smoking room. We were then placed on the 19th floor with enough distance from the heater to avoid any noise. 
The rooms are extremely small. There is barely room to walk around the bed or even pass each other from the front door to the rest room. I've been in larger hotel rooms in Japan and parts of Europe, this was a surprise. If you plan on staying for more than 2 nights, I suggest staying somewhere else since we had no space to unpack or drawers to organize yourselves.
I can forgive the rooms but what really made the stay at the Hudson unbearable was the horrible staff. For the most part, they are on the younger side of the spectrum and have a lot to learn in regards to service. I would say this especially for the restaurant and bar. The waiter neglected to write our order and brought us our food incorrectly, not once but twice within the one sitting. The attendance they have to actual serving is bare. They are obviously selective on who they give their attention to. The bar staff is basically the same, judging you as you walk in. Ridiculously enough, a friend that I was entertaining at the bar was asked to put his jacket back on since they have a policy of not letting jackets be draped over the chair. While my friend obliged, I could see three other tables that were not asked to do the same but looked no different to my friend. The impression they left with me was a level of immaturity that comes with inexperience and misdirected energy.
I will say this. I found the reception and doormen to be very helpful during my stay. 
The key fixtures of the place are nice to look at but the details are lacking and I feel the hotel depends on low lighting far too much to mask these problem areas. It looks fine but really doesn't address the customer when it comes to practical comforts and functionality.",sato_bkk,2007-06-01,223023,2007-06-01,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Mixed experiences at the Hudson” Whilst there were good points about this hotel, I have to say I can see where many of the negative comments posted are coming from. I think it depends on whether the beautiful design makes you more forgiving of other issues. We stayed here because we wanted a unique NYC experience and appreciate good design (you can stay at a Hilton in any city after all), and we did get that and enjoy our stay. This was definitely a plus point, it looked great. We were lucky with our room too as had upgraded to a superior room after reading reviews, so we has plenty of space, it was a corner room so plenty of windows and light, clean, cool design and a suprisingly decent sized bathroom (and high enough up on 17th floor to avoid being disturbed by the noisy bar). Ask for room 1700 if you want to be certain of a decent room!! The bar looked great and was always busy, but we quickly discovered that this was a beautiful place for pretentious, unfriendly people(both staff and residents!), so sought out more down to earth places to spend our money and didnt really take full advantage of the communal areas. It would have been nice if someone had told us (even apologised) for the sky terrace being closed for renovation, as this had been a factor in our choosing to stay here: instead when we asked, we were told 'you know what, its closed' - well thanks for the info! Whilst some staff were friendly and helpful, I have to say that generally that wasn't the case and there was a definite feeling that we ought to consider ourslves lucky to be staying there rather than the other way round. Location on the edge of the fantastic central park , the amazing whole foods market in the Time Warner centre and subway opposite a real plus (it was easy to explore the whole of manhattan using the subway, though if you intend to spend you time discovering the rather more interesting and 'real' downtown, you might consider staying south of midtown). Overall, we were happy with our room and impressed by the design, but the snobby vibe meant that really we didnt fully take advantage (or want to) of the facilities it had to offer. An interesting place with not-so interesting people.

"“Temperature problems” Good location. Impressive lobby. Staff quite friendly. Room _very_ small for two, and not comfortable (bed very low). The worst problem was the heating though as there seemed to be no way of controlling the temperature. It was either much too hot or freezing cold - and mostly much too hot as it was impossible to turn the heating off for more than a few minutes. The staff seemed aware of the problem, but unable to fix it.

"“Disappointing Hotel, uncomfortable rooms” We spent a week in NYC, staying at the Hudson. This was our 40th wedding anniversary and we were so looking forward to this trip. We had a fabulous time in spite of the unpleasant experience of staying at the Hudson Hotel. The room was very small, as was the bed. The hallways, dark and confusing. the loud ""noise"" that was supposed to be music in the lobby. We booked through Hotwire so could n't change hotels unfortunately. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone!

"“Perfect for singles who like the nightlife!” A friend and myself stayed at this hotel over Memorial Day weekend, and we had both been apprehensive after reading reviews about how tiny the rooms were. However, this hotel was so cool that it totally made up for the fact that the rooms were indeed the size of a large closet. The guys that worked at the front desk/concierge/bellhops HAD to have been male models - they were all incredibly good looking and fun to talk to. Definitely a perk to have some nice eye candy working there. The bars - the Library, Private Park, and Hudson bar were all impossibly cool with great mixes of music playing at night.
I felt like staying at this hotel was like hanging out at a cool nightclub. It's even neat that the hotel doesn't even have a sign outside - you just have to know it's there. We had good service when requesting things like extra towels. If you stay there, request a higher floor - we stayed on the 14th floor because the guy at the front desk said that the lower floors are right above the bars and are pretty noisy. I would definitely recommend this hotel to young singles who are coming to New York to feel like the jet set!",vengajen,2007-05-01,223023,2007-05-29,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Had a great stay” I was a little weary about staying here based on some of the reviews but since I used hotwire I couldn't change it. Let me say, I don't know what some people expect from places. I'm sure there are some bad stories with hotels, but I really think people nit-pick everything. The Hudson staff was very friendly, there was not ""loud"" music blasting in the lobby and elevator. I would say the staff was one of the best I've dealt with honestly,
The rooms are small, but it wasn't small enough to make me feel uncomfortable. I stayed with my wife and we had no problems walking around in the room. The bathroom is tight so if you are a bigger person you might have some problems, but I'm sure you could manage.
We ordered room service our first night and they told us it would be 30 minutes. 33 minutes later the phone rang and it was the room service staff and they said the dinner would be free because it wasn't on time. Maybe 2 minutes later there was a knock on the door and our food was there. I couldn't believe it.
Anyone considering this hotel should give it a shot, my wife and I loved and we would stay there in a heartbeat.",noog99,2007-05-01,223023,2007-05-29,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Surprised by the Hudson!” I read all the bad reviews from 2 years ago, panicked, and tried to move to another hotel the day before our arrival, but none were available so we had to stay at the Hudson. 
We were pleasantly surprised to find that all of the bad comments in past reviews were all reversed. Everyone was not rude and pretentious but rather exceptionally helpful and friendly. The room was not tiny (by New York Standards) and was beautifully designed with hardwood floors and flowing white curtains, the beds were comfortalbe with European style white comforters. I think the design is that of a yacht and our room had 2 double beds and there was 5 feet between the beds and 2 feel on either side, which was more than adequate. There were no drawers for clothing, but the clothes we couldn't hang, we put on the shelf above the hanging rod near the entrance. I didn't mind as I would honestly rather have room to move around than have it taken up by a dresser. We were on the 23rd floor, the top floor below the penthouse, room #2307 and heard NO noise from the night club as indicated in previous reviews. The lobby is beautiful! It mixes nature/foliage with a gorgeous gigantic chandelier. Breakfast or lunch for 2 people without alcohol was $50 at ""The Hudson Cafeteria"", which is not a cafeteria but rather a restaurant at which you can sit inside or outside - which we chose, but I found that expensive price to be consistant with any other restaurant in New York City. The breakfast had a nice selection and lunch was good as well with garlic fries as an option. The club sandwich was good, except that the mayo used had lemon in it which was too overpowering and cancelled out the other flavors. Ask for regular mayo without lemon and it will be perfect. The former bad reviews also said that there was no express checkout and that they had to wait in line, but there is express check out now that you can either do over the phone, or they put the bill under your door the morning you leave and if you agree with it, you do not have to do anything at all, just leave. The hotel is very ""cool"" as is it's design and staff. It's so cool that the name isn't even on the outside! You'll know your hotel by a huge torch flame on the side of the building at the entrance on 58th at 9th and of course all of the taxis waiting in line to pick up guests or people waiting to get into the night club. Whole foods market is below the mall across the street and it is HUGE, and even has lots of deli and prepared foods. There is also a Starbucks as well as a Duane Reade Drug store on the same side as the Hudson. We paid $280 for our room and stayed Wednesday-Sunday.

"“The Hudson - for trendy people” I met a friend who had already booked at the Hudson. so it was convenient to stay there. It was an interesting experience.
I booked the ""cheapest"" room available (about $300 for a single), but was fortunately upgraded to a queen-size bed at check-in. The room was very small and I'm not sure 2 people could have stayed there without falling over each other. 
There are several room configurations; mine had the see-through bathroom. My friend actually had a tub as well as a shower in the bathroom and a bit more space. 
The rooms are clean. The hallways are poorly lit. 
We had breakfast the first morning in the outdoor dining area which was pleasant. I had an omelet and coffee, my friend had OJ, scrambled eggs and coffee. The bill was $71. We didn't do that again!

"“Loved the Hudson” Just returned from a week at the Hudson. Loved this hotel! The location is not to be beat. Across from Time Warner Center. Close to subway and Central Park. The room was a bit smallish. The bed was extremely comfortable. 
I used the business center. Was well stocked and very convenient. 
The staff was more than friendly. Promptly greeted and offered assistance. Every time I saw a staff member, they greeted me. 
The hotel is very trendy and fun. The private park was amazing. 
The only detractor that I found was, as in other reviews, the bathroom is very small. I am very short and I found it confining, however, I was determined to make the best of it and adjusted. The toiletries were superb. One good thing the bathroom had was an ample shelf to put your makeup, curling iron, etc., which not all hotels have, so I feel that this helped. 
I had to switch to another hotel for the rest of my stay and was veeerrry sad to leave the Hudson. I will definitely stay there again.",skennedy62,2007-05-01,223023,2007-05-23,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Two Thumbs Down For The Hudson” Tacky yellow neon escalators lead you into the best part of the Hudson - the common spaces, which are really pretty. The lobby (though obnoxiously loud because of the constant pump of music 24/7), the outside patio, the library room, the restaurants and the bar, are all beautiful but crowded and loud.
Then upstairs to the tiniest, most uncomfortable room I've ever stayed in. And to top it off there was a rather noticeable and revolting blood stain on the otherwise pristine white comforter. The bathroom was a postage stamp and poorly lit. My view was of air conditioning vents, and despite the fact that I opted for a ""larger room,"" my room was so small I could practically stretch my legs and touch the next wall. The TV didn't work. The halls were so noisy I could barely sleep and the service was mediocre at best.
It was a good location in midtown but, ultimately, there are a lot to choose from and I certainly wouldn't choose this hotel again.",yardsusa,2007-05-01,223023,2007-05-21,False,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“What A Disappointment!!!” After seeing the Hudson showcased on the travel channel as one of New York's hidden treasures, I thought I'd give it a try. Excited about it being a Phillip Starck/Ian Schrager concept hotel, I eagerly booked our rooms. Although I did read some reviews on another travel website, most simply remarked how small the rooms were. Well, that's just the beginning.
It's fun to imagine that one must take a banana yellow glowing escalator to the huge atrium lobby that's covered with faux ivy. The lobby is quite impressive as it gives you a feel that you've entered another dimension, hip, chic and euro-styled. The front desk staff were robotic, dressed in black from head to toe. Nothing warm about them. No eye contact and not very eager to be of service to the first time guest. The music was a thumping, hip euro beat, the volume so loud that it was nearly impossible to hear the monotone voice of the clerk. We were pointed in the direction of the elevators. That's where the horror began. The lighting in the hallways was so low that one literally needed a flashlight to find their way - - not exaggerating. The elevators were playing the same euro disco music at a deafening level, too.
When we arrived our designated floor 5, we landed upon a grungy carpet smelling of mildew and cigarettes. The stains on the carpet left one to imagine what could possibly be lurking in the fibers below. The hallways smelled horribly of cigarette smoke. When we opened the door to our room, I was not surprised by the decor nor the size of the room, as I had taken a virtual tour on the Hudson's website prior to our stay. I expected the room to be small, but this was ridiculous. The bed was literally a futon on the floor, you could actually trip over it if you weren't paying attention. The lighting poor here, too. Maybe stark is trendy, but not to provide proper shelf space in the bathroom for your toiletries is pathetic. They've taken minimalist to the enth degree. No place to hang your wet towel after your shower. Starck and/or Schrager has worked so hard on minimalist chic style, that they've forgotten about the guest's comfort. Or maybe they spent so much money in the lobby and bar area, that they were forced to put plastic shelving from Ikea throughout the bathroom and lightweight aluminum chairs and tables in the room. 
The air conditioner had a mind of it's own. Sometimes it was freezing, and other times it registered 78 degrees. The sound from the nightclub on the lobby level made it's way clear up to the 5th floor. The surly security guard stopped us as we were headed towards the elevators on Friday night around midnight.
The food in the Cafeteria left much to be desired. The service throughout the entire property was absent. The robotic, self-proclaimed pretty people on staff, made one feel that you were putting them out just by offering a hello. On Saturday morning as we were leaving for the day, a maintenance employee was scattering carpet fresh powder throughout the hallways. When I asked him what he was doing, he said ""getting rid of the smell"", as if this was a daily chore.
There was no turn-down service either night. I guess for $600 a night, you're on your own in that department. We were actually surprised to see that the room had been made up after we returned from our day.
This morning as we were packing up, we discovered the ""required by law"" posting of their rack rate for our specific room. We were already being over charged by $20 per night. When my husband questioned the clerk at the front desk about the rack rate discovery, the clerk said abruptly ""I've NEVER seen this posted in any of our rooms. This is your charge that's on your bill."" He was rude and abrupt. Maybe he was in a bad mood due to the obvious removal of some facial piercings gone bad. He had visible crusty scabs where a nose ring must have been and a bloody crusty scab where a post would have gone below his bottom lip. Ewwww.... Maybe that's why he was flippant. But, then again, that was the overall tone from the entire staff, from bellman all the way through the entire staff.
Maybe they just don't need to do things right as the place seemed packed with Euro travelers enjoying the exchange rate. I guess they hit you hard with the lobby space then stick it to you once you enter your postage stamp size of a room. After you've entered this dark den of cigarette smoke, you should do yourself a favor and check out. We wish we had. Oh, and by the way, I asked the surly security guard about the cigarette smoking. I said ""I thought New York State was a non-smoking State"" , meaning it is illegal to smoke in a public place. He said, ""you're correct."" Then I asked him ""well, how do you explain this thick smoke that I see in all of the shinning lights and the stench of cigarrettes throughout this place."" He turned and walked away. Which is what I regret we didn't do when we first entered the lobby on Friday afternoon.

"“Boutique at its best” We checked into the Hudson around 2 pm on May 11, 2007. Check-in was quick and easy. Staff was very helpful. The elevator music was as trendy as promised.
The room was small but clean and elegantly simple. Our window looked out over 9th avenue and from the 14th floor street noise was not a problem.
The bathroom was tight but clean and the toiletries provided were very high quality. The only negative was the shower curtain which was just way too short and allowed water to flow onto the floor leaving a bit of a mess.
We ate breakfast at Saffee, a cool little place about a half a block to the right of the hotel near 8th Avenue. The price was right and the food was good. Starbucks is just a few doors down from Saffee.
Comments that ""older travelers"" wouldn't like this hotel were debunked since I was traveling with my 80 year old mother on our 3rd annual Mother's day trip to New York. She really loved the Hudson. On Saturday we ate lunch out on the terrace and enjoyed the terrific ambience as well as the wonderful food.

"“Hudson's tiny room is OK, but let there be light!!” My sister & I were very concerned by the terrible comments people posted about the teeny rooms of the Hudson. We booked through Hotwire - only after we paid did we find out where we were staying. Had we seen the reviews first we probably would never have stayed here, which would have been a shame. We stayed in a superior room.
Yes, the room is itty bitty, but there is a small hall closet to hang a few garments & store suitcases & a small cupboard instead of a dresser with drawers; there were 3 hooks in the hall & 2 hooks in the bathroom & a rail under the sink for handtowels. There were shelves above the toilet (keep the toilet lid closed while you're working in that area or face the consequences) & a surface under the vessel sink for toiletries. In short, it's small but cleverly laid out; with a bit of creativity & humor, & by moving slowly and carefully, the room is very workable.
What simply did not work was the poor but stylish lighting. Everything was dim, dull and dark - the bedroom, the bathroom, front lobby, elevators; the hallways were absolutely sepulchral, with dim green lamps above each door - very institutional and spooky. Bring your own flashlight...
Customer service at the front desk was superb - warm, friendly, cheerful, helpful, genuine; seeing as this is such a trendy young person's hotel I was expecting attitude, but Sarah, Clark and Giselle were simply wonderful. The service staff was also great, coming up promptly when asked and opening a sticky window. The cleaning staff do a great job - the room was kept very clean. The bed was too low to the ground for my preference, but otherwise was very comfortable, and the duvet was comfy and cozy. Our room faced over the garden bar rather than the street, but it was pretty quiet anyway.
We found a terrific diner on 57 St by 8th Ave, called the Moonrock - if you get Rosie the service is superb, otherwise can be pretty poor but the food & prices are great. There's also the Flame diner, several other restaurants and bars, & grocery stores (57th and 9th Ave) so eats can be as cheap as you like. We did not even try the Hudson's food or drinks - expensive ($5 for a 1/2 litre bottle of water in our room, v. $2.50 for a gallon bottle of Poland Springs water, $1.50 per bottle of beer at the little grocer around the corner).
The location is by far the best thing about this hotel - 5 minutes to Time Warner shopping, Columbus Circle and Central Park; 20 minutes max to Times Square & the theater district. It is in a more residential area which to me was quieter (in NYC? HAH!) and nicer to stay in. 
I can appreciate the stylishness and ambience of the Hudson - it truly is very distinctive and different from any other hotel I've ever stayed in.

"“great location,very noisy” I chose this hotel due to the location and it being trendy. The location is perfect for NYC. Probelm is that the downstairs bar/club has loud thumping music till 3am on Friday and Saturday. Even though I was on the 10th floor- could hear every word. This was unacceptable.
The check in desk is like a cattle ranch- very chaotic. The staff at the reception are hurried and very curt and give minimal info. concierge also very rushed- every request seems an effort and answers are brief and unhelpful.
It was also annoying that in the evenings, burly guards stand at the elevators- rude and unfriendly they ask for ID if you enter the lifts. This is irritating as one feels imprisoned and it takes the freedom of the holiday away.

"“Loved the Hudson” I stayed at Hudson for a 6 day holiday.
The hotel atmosphere is really cool: the lobby has been decorated by Philippe Starck, and the atmolsphere is informal and chic at the same time; the lighting is ""sexy"", the bar is fun.
The location is great, uptown near Central Park and Columbus Circle, withing walking distance of Theater District and shopping area -Fifth and Madison-.
Complimentary coffe is served in the morning -not everybody knows this-, but I had breakafast at nearby Stabucks or Flame's Diner.
Rooms: everyboday says they're too small; they're small, and I had a shared standard room, but it was so nice, and cool, with a very original barhroom and lighting, that you forget size.
If you, like me, are the typical tourists who's visiting NYC the whole day, the room is fine; if you intend to stay in the room for work, e.g.,, well it may be too small, like approximately 12-14 sq. metres.

"“For single travellers only” Plus points:
Location, location, location - wide street, with little through traffic, an easy walk to Barneys, Bloomies, Saks etc.

Room decor - Loved the wood panelling, sheer curtains and the white/chrome clinical bathroom. Bed/pillows v comfy.
Minus points:
Tiny tiny room, even by New York standards - Tolerable if you are travelling alone, but I would have felt seriously claustrophobic if there with anyone else.
Bar in the atrium - light sleepers would hate the background noise from the bar in the evenings, and I was on a high floor.

"“Great- just as website says” After searching many websites we finally chose the hudson. I am glad we did, it is in a great location, a two minute walk from 2 coffee bars, subway, and columbus circle. Cental park is within a 5 minute walk. 
The hotel is just as on its website very stylish. There is great music playing throughout and all of the public rooms are different in style. The main bar we found to be loud and busy in the evening which if you want to drink and dance is great. The outside bar area which is a smoking area is lovely. Waitress service somewhat of a limited pricy drinks menu but you're paying for the experience. 
The hallways are dark but it was not a problem for us. The bedrooms are small but we found them to be all that was needed for our four night stay in this fabulous city!! The bathrooms were so small they just made us laugh as yes your knees do touch the wall while sitting on the toilet but the shower and sink are fine and both the bathroom and the bedroom were spotless all through our stay.

"“Had a wonderful time” We just stayed here last month. I have to say I was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews, but we had a wonderful time at this hotel. Yes, the rooms are small, but how much time will you spend in the room while in NYC? The rooms are very modern and clean. The bed is very comfortable. My only complaint is that there are is no dresser to put clothes in, but we managed with the closet and small cabinet. We were only here 4 days. I think for a week long vacation you would have trouble finding room for your clothes. We had great service here. The staff was always very nice and helpful, attending to our every need, from restaurant reservations to shower caps. Everything was handled quickly. The bars and restaurant are beautiful as is the lobby.

"“Funky, Euro Flair” Funky hotel in a great location--a short walk to Central Park, the theatre district and museums. Rooms were small but stylish--like being in a nice cabin on a cruise ship. Would help if the hotel had its name (or street number) somewhere on the exterior of the building. The lighting's a little dark for my taste but that's part of the ambience.

"“Think twice” Where to begin...I decided to try this hotel thinking I could save some money by staying a little out of the way, in a small room. Upon check in at this bar like hotel I had to yell to be heard by the desk clerk. After check in, I went up to the room and first encountered a hallway full of pot smoke. I entered the room which was very small but stylish. Upon closer inspection I noticed that the metal chair was covered with dust, the all white tile bathroom floor highlighted the hair (pubic) from the previous guest. I picked up the phone to call the front desk to ask for a new room only to realize that the phone did not work.
I was eventually relocated to another room and it was saturated with the smell of smoke.
I knew at that point that I had made a mistake and checked out.

"“Such a letdown after The Clift” We stayed in the Hudson for 4 nights as the last stop in our honeymoon trip in the US. Excellent experiences at THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay in Vegas and the Hudson's sister hotel in San Fran - The Clift were sadly not repeated in NYC. Due to a delayed flight from SF we did not arrive at The Hudson until 10pm. By that time the bar had livened up - trust me, that is cool with us - but being directly adjacent to reception made the check-in experiencing a frustrating one. I asked what size of room we were in ( The Clift upgraded us to a Suite without having to ask) Our unhepful check in clerk said that it was a queen size bed, but some people felt the rooms were small ( and he honestly sniggered to himself) Once in the room it was apparent that things would be cramped - our 2 suitcases just fit in the clothing area which was one shelve ( no drawers)and 4 hangers each. The large mirrors on two walls did not gin teh illusion of space as planned. The AC unit is built into the headboard making the bed seem as if you are sleeping on a hairdryer !! The iron-board was just twice the size of my laptop. It was April ( not warm outside) but I had to turn teh fan to full and temp to 40 degrees to stop sweating when teh shower and iron were on - the room was that small that it quickly turne into a steam room. When contacted, our friendly (not!) reception said that a suite was avalable Fri-Sun and a hold would be put on for us as Thurs was fully booked. I visited reception on Friday morning to discover that no hold existed, and that they would not hold the room long enough for me to return to the room to discuss the additional $150 upgrade charge per night. We attempted to put this behind us and concentrate on teh amazing city that is NYC. We got engaged there 2 years ago and had spent every day waiting to return. A visit to the hotel bar and resturant to view our home for teh next 4 nights were met with almost contempt. The bouncer took some convincing that we were residents...I had to show my room key to gain access, and the maitre de at the resturaunt physically turned her nose up. The Hudson is in an excellent location - chosen specifically with Columbus Circle aross the road, and around teh corner from Central Park. The design is cool (however we were very disapointed that the roof terrace was closed due to being 'out of season' - although no note of this was on teh website) The whole experience is destroyed by the staff...the check-in staff are snobby, abrupt and simply rude....and not even good at there job. I asked them a question once and they took 20mins to find me on the system....we had been there for 3 days !!!!! When booking our aiport limo the concierge said they were contracted to one company (They charged $130 and could not calll my prefernce ) I had to use my cell phone to call a car ...whih only cost $99. They nicest people we met were house keeping - they at least smiled and said hello. We are well travelled and are not fussy ( this is my 1st ever hotel complaint) but the Hudson left a bad taste in our mouths. If teh trip was not prepaid we would have checked out and checked into teh Ameritania ( half the price, double the size and ten times the welcome) where we stayed previously. I would advise the Hudson management to go on a team building exercise to The Clift in SF. Now that is a hotel which proudly displays what is great and good about boutique hotels and is a true ambassador for teh Morgan's group.

"“cute trendy hotel, but watch out for the ridiculous parking rates if you drive!” As many reviews have said, it's a cute trendy hotel. The bar is cool,
Room is small but this is New York City. If you like modernism design
you'll love the room. It's clean, the floor is wooden, not carpet, so
it doesn't feel as cozy but then you don't have to worry about how dirty the carpet might be. There is no sign on the front of the building so it's very easy to miss it. 
My biggest complaint is about the parking rate they charge. I parked my car there for 2 nights. I was told it was $49 when I checked out, which would be normal in NYC, but later found out it's $49 PER NIGHT!
They actually use the parking garage of Warner Center across the street and the posted rates there is about $25 per day.

"“What a dump! But the food was good” I spent last week at the Hudson with a group conference. My overall impression was of a very depressing place with mediocre service. Everywhere was dark and gloomy... the lobby, the halls, the rooms. I think the intent was hip and chic, but it did not come across that way. When the elevator opened on the room floors, you immediately were hit with the smell of mildewed carpet. When I looked down, I could see why. There was peeling paint in the halls and bathroom.
In addition to already poor lighting in my tiny room, two of the ceiling lights were out. So I saw a bellman and asked him what I should do to get them fixed. He said he would notify maintenance for the repair. No one ever fixed them.
In the conference area restroom, toilet paper was not routinely maintained.
The hotel has no gift shop or offerings if you forget any basic toiletries. When I asked, I was told there is a pharmacy nearby and given a map.
On the positive side, all the food I had was excellent, fresh, and creative. I only ate in conference meal settings so I cannot compare with the restaurant offerings.",SandyRaleigh,2007-04-01,223023,2007-04-23,False,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Hudson is not as bad as others said” Booked the Hudson hotel thru priceline for the Easter weekend and I was shocked and worried to see so many negative reviews about this hotel.
We arrived at Hudson 10am, was helped with checking in the baggages and my request for a higher floor room was honored with no problem.
Room is small but very nicely decorated (I travelled with my wife), a bit too dim, washroom is ok (yeah the famous knee banging the wall toilet bowl). We love the glass wall between the washroom and the bedroom.
No coffee maker in the room but free coffee was provided in the cafe (which I like coz I don't have to make my own), library/lobby/Hudson bar is what I expected from a chic hotel. 
The only problem was the bill for room service (I have never asked for any service) but the staff helped me with that and problem solved in a minute.
Very nice and helpful staff and baggage storage service was superb.

"“Loved the Hudson” I stayed at the Hudson for 3 days last week. I had read the reviews before booking. It's true the rooms are small, the halls are dark and the bathroom is tiny - BUT it's super clean and the location is great!
The staff was very friendly - upon my arrival, they had only smoking rooms available but they arranged that I could switch to a non-smoking room the next day. They even moved my bags to that room so all i had to do was have my things packed before leaving for the day and then pick up my new room keys. The guys at the entrance are very friendly too. And storing your bags is free for hotel guests. 
The rooms are small but the bed is very comfortable. The A/C and heater worked fine and weren't loud at all. I had a room on the 5th floor and on the 9th floor - I didn't hear any noise from the bar at all. 
Some said the halls are scary - they are dark, that's true but not scary. I always felt safe. I never had to wait for an elevator either.
Location is great - the subway is right around the corner and you can walk to Times Square and 5th Avenue. There are lots of restaurants nearby and a Whole Food Market in the Time Warner Building. Starbucks is close too.
I will definitely come back to the Hudson. It's perfect for traveling alone. I would not recommend it to families and the older travellers though.

"“""dont take it personally""” I am actually still staying at the Hudson and yes, the bar is cool and yes, the location is great but because of a computer system failure when I tried to get dinner tonight I was told that I could not eat in the restaurant and could not order room service. Normally this might be amusing but having flown 18 hour direct flight from Bangkok I was not amused. Receptionist (very cool, hip trendy as most of the staff are) said, ""dont take it personally"" which of course seeing as it is me that is hungry it is hard not to!!
I am doubting my decision to stay here but I believed that I was checking in to a cool/chic hotel in one of the best cities in the world and expected more service - silly me (service, which also means carrying your own luggage from the taxi up a set of escalators to reception and then to your room) but if you like 25m2 rooms and being treated like you are not cool enough to be here (maybe I am spoilt living in Asia) then this is a good choice - sadly it is a busy weekend in New York and I while I have tried to find another option for my next 4 days it looks like I am stuck here and hopefully the computer system problem will be resolved and I will get fed tomorrow.",BFB62,2007-04-01,223023,2007-04-15,False,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Tiny rooms, belligerent management” The hotel has a nice location, but three things absolutely killed the experience for me.
First, the rooms were tiny. I have stayed in New York City hotels many times, and I know real estate is at a premium. All hotel rooms are small relative to other cities. But this hotel's rooms were much smaller than the average even for the city. The bed essentially filled the room, and there was about one foot of space between its edges and the walls.
Second, the room was freezing and there was no heat. It was a warm night, but the air conditioner was on when I arrived and the room was sixty degrees. The heater didn't work. I called the front desk and they promised to send up a mechanic. No mechanic arrived. By now it was midnight and I had an interview the next day. I called again, and the hotel manager got on the line. I was extremely polite, but he was rude and angry. He said that the heating system was not working because it was warm out that night and there was nothing I could do. I complained again that the room was too cold to sleep, and he said something rude and hung up on me.
Finally, several months later, I discovered that the hotel had billed my credit card some $10 more than they were supposed to. They would not respond to my questions when I called.
I strongly recommend choosing a different hotel. I have stayed in many hotels in Manhattan had have otherwise had only positive experiences. This one was terrible. I would rather stay in a hotel in Brooklyn and take a cab into the city during the day than have to stay at the Hudson Hotel again.",PenderPrime,2006-10-01,223023,2007-04-11,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Not for the Visualy Impaired !” The Hudson is DARK and Dingey. We upgraded to a suite which was stark in appearance. Had to buy ear plugs to sleep as a large air con unit outside our window was running 24/7.
Check in took more than 30 minutes because another guest with the same surname as me was checking in that day, this caused complications for the clerk, he twice had to call the manager over to assist him.
The common halls and passageways are very poorly lit and the carpet is grubby. The lobby and bar are very trendy, but in an effort to be 'cool' all the warmth has been stripped out. After a day shopping in NY you need somewhere to go back to and relax, this Hotel does not have that, most annoyingly trying to sit at a table in the bar and constantly being told it was reserved and having to move. We refused one night to move from a table that did not have a reserved sign on it and security was called ended up with a big row and a refusal to serve us any more alchohol, the waitress partonisingly bringing us water, we were not drunk.

"“Cool hip hotel” I stayed at the Hudson with my fashionista sister and had a fantastic time. I loved this hotel especially the clever design of space and light. After reading several reviews regarding the size of the rooms, I was expecting a broom cupboard! What a load of rubbish the room used all its space to the full advantage. I thought it was a clever use of space and had everything we required. I shared the room with my sister who is a fashion buyer and as you can imagine we had lots of luggage. We managed to store everything perfectly. 
The bathroom was compact and maybe the loo was too close to the sink so you could not be too tall or too fat! But it was fine. 
The staff were really friendly and the one breakfast we had was fantastic with great service. The only rude encounter we had was with a doorman on the last day who collected our bags and unfortunately we had run out of dollars to tip him. He slammed the door and was quite rude. But we thought it was funny especially the bits of tissue paper on his face where he had cut himself shaving. 
We always tip generously so it was unfortunate that this chap got the short straw. We had spent the day shopping and just run out of dollars. All the other staff were friendly and very helpful.
There was a good mixture of ages at the hotel and it had a really lively atmosphere. Everyone seemed to really enjoy staying here. 
I dont think it is a young person's hotel, maybe for people who appreciate style and design and are not set in their ways.
To be honest we did not make the most of the hotel because we were out and about. I think the hotel is used just as a base. The rooms encouarge people to explore. New York is such a fantastic 24/7 city we wanted to be in our room as little as possible.
The location was great. We had a brilliant evening of latin jazz at the Lincoln centre just five minutes from the hotel. There is a delicious take-out Mexican two minutes away. This serves authentic Mexican. There is a traditional diner which was good for a late night coffee and snack. Blossom a really good vegetarian restaurant is also close by.
It seems to be a popular hotel with New Yorkers partying at the weekends. The noise never affected us and we barely heard any from our room. The air conditioning was not at all disruptive. According to some of the reviews I felt like I was staying in a different hotel. Both my sister and I have stayed in many exquisite hotels all over the world. I loved the Hudson it was hip and more of an conceptual experience.

"“Ignore the 'one-star' reviews” My wife and I stayed at the Hudson for a week and found it well-above average. After reading the vast number of negative reviews I was really apprehensive of the booking (which was done through Hotwire, so we didn't know where we were going until money was spent). YES, the rooms are small. YES, it's uber-hip, and that can be an issue if you're staying on any floor under the 5th floor (you could probably hear the music from the bar if you were to stay on a lower floor, but we were on the 8th floor). There was an issue with the boiler one day so we didn't have hot water, but our calls were met with courteous staff and a prompt call from their engineering department.
The real reason to stay at the Hudson, though, is the location. You're less than 1 block from the Time Warner center & accompanying subway stops, and about 1 block from Central Park.
For the money we paid per night, and considering the costs of other hotels in the area that I've been to in the past and that charge MUCH more, the Hudson is an above average value.

"“Hotel was fine ... book a larger room” We won this hotel for ourselves and another couple on priceline. for a very low price. When I found out it was the Hudson, my heart dropped we were here for a speical occaision and I had read many reviews here on tripadvisor warning about the exceedingly small rooms and bathrooms. Since my price was very low, I decided to upgrade well in advance. This was not an easy task to do through priceline, and the only way I was able to eventually upgrade was by e-mailing the hotel management. We paid an additional $90 per room for a 300 sq. tt. deluxe double, and it was well worth it and still a bargain for the fabulous mid-town west location.
Our room was certainly large enough with a bathroom that was a good size. The rooms are furnished in a european modern style. Although the TV screen was small it wasn't any problem. We enjoyed the stylish furniture with platform beds, and wood floors. The lighting was fine, and the hotel room kept very clean. We had night stands, a desk, a chair, and a safe in the room. There are no drawers for putting clothes, but they do have shelf space. There was an open closet area for hanging clothes.
Yes the halls are dark, painted with gunmetal gray walls, and dark carpet. But there is a light over each hotel room entrance door, and although not particularly attractive, it is not terrible either or scary as others may have reported.
The staff was helpful and pleasant. We parked across the street in the self parking lot for $39 a day, My advice is to think outside the box if you stay at the Hudson because it is stylish, but not traditional so accept it for what it is a stylish, fun, funky place to stay. We found that we could walk almost everywhere, broadway shows, restaurants, shopping.

If you're expecting an upperclass or stylish hotel you're definately gonna be disappointed. As other reviewers already said, the lobby and bar are quite nice but as soon as you go to the room floors the image changes.
We had a deluxe double double room with 350 sq feet, so the size was quite ok, but the room was very smelly and noisy. The carpet on the floor was all wet when we entered the room. The ceiling was covered with yellow spots, half of the tiles in the bathroom were broken. The safe, TV and air conditionning didn't work correctly.

There was no noise at all from the bar, and we were on the 7th floor. 
I found the staff extremely helpful, without exception, (and will just say hi to Aaron on the front desk, who checked us out) - reception and concierge desk responded to any queries promptly and in a most helpful way, and housekeeping were there with our requirements in 5 minutes.
The location was great for us, and all I would say to anyone who doesn't like the location is: book somewhere else!
I would not recommend this for a business traveller, purely because business travellers have special requirements, or to those with children.

"“Small and Uncomfortable” My husband and I live in NYC and were to spend four nights at the Hudson Hotel. We'd been to the hotel bar and restaurant before and found them nicely appointed and enjoyable with a great vibe. When we checked into our room everything changed - it was a different story. Our room was about, oh, 100 square feet total. So small that my husband and I couldn't open our suitcases at the same time. There is just enough room for the queen size bed with a walkway around three sides. The TV is 12"". The bathroom was not any bigger - the toilet is so close to the wall that when you sit down your knees touch the wall. We're not a high-maintenance couple by any means, and at first we decided to get over the size and lack of comfort. That is until we tried to sleep. The beds are rock hard. We tossed and turned most of the night because we were so uncomfortable. After the first night we checked out and headed to another hotel for the remainder of the weekend… Bottom line, in my opinion this hotel is in a good location and has a decent bar. The rooms are unbearably small and uncomfortable.",SFNY,2007-03-01,223023,2007-03-23,False,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“We loved the Hudson!” I was almost going to cancel my reservation at the Hudson Hotel after reading all the negative reviews. I am so relieved we didn't!! We Loved the Hudson!!
ok, so the rooms are small. BUT they are also very stylish and kept very clean. How much time are you going to spend in the hotel.....its NYC baby!! The only annoying things that we found were lack of lighting in the bedroom area - not good for doing your make up (but I used the bathroom mirror - that was ok) and also as it has been said many times on this site you do have to live out your suitcase a bit due to lack of storage space, but nothing that annoyed us too much. 
The bar and restaurant were great although a little expensive. We booked the restaurant for valentines night (it was snowing so we decided to eat/dink at hotel) it was a good choice. the food was lovely!! The restaurant is called the ""Cafeteria” and is set out with communal tables which is a little odd but also a little bit different. We didn't have to sit side by side with other couples (maybe would other than Valentines - not sure) 
We never had any problems with the staff. Although we had little dealings with them (check in/out, restaurant, bar) they were always fairly friendly and helpful. 
The location is fantastic, right next to Columbus Circle Subway and Central Park. easy walk to all the sights, Time square was about a 10 min walk, a walk to 5th square next to Tiffany’s and FAO Schwartz was about the same. We only got taxis and subway a couple of times as we wanted to walk to see all the sights.

The staff was quite friendly throughout the stay, and our room was clean upon arrival and nicely cleaned each day.
Avoid using the hotel business center if possible. The cost is $5.95 for 15 minutes.

"“Not as bad as people think” Come on, people. Get real. It's New York, the hotel is in the middle of the action, and you know it's a hip hotel. Get over it. 
I had a great stay early March. They couldn't check me in early (checkin time is 3pm) so I dropped off my luggage at the bellstand without a fuss and without a charge. Just tip the staff, that's it. The same when we had a late flight, we dropped off our bags after the 12pm checkout and picked them up after 4pm.
Location is perfect! Subway station is half a block away, the hotel is within easy walking from Central Park and 5th Avenue shopping disctrict. If you're coming from JFK it's not that difficult to take the subway either. There is no sign in front of the hotel, but you can't miss it. IT'S A BIG GREEN BUILDING! So there. Stop complaining. If you're still confused, the Concierge will give you directions to all the hotspots around town easily. Its website has directions to the hotel as well.
Agents at reception were warm. One lady named Avalon (spelling?) even offered to move me from a smoking room to a non-smoking one, but I'd already gotten comfy I didn't want to move, and the room didn't smell of smoke at all. Lobby is stunning (if misteriously dark at night) with the clear glass roof. The room is small, of course, definitely in need of more counter space, but I only spent time sleeping in the room. Our room was on th 5th floor and no disturbing noise permeated from the club below on Saturday night. Sure you find pretentious people in the club, but just mind your own business and you'll have a good time. The Library is as crowded during our Saturday night there. Unfortunately the garden downstairs and the terrace were not open due to weather.
We didn't use room service, knowing that it's expensive, so we went to restaurants around the city for the local flavor. I think that's the way to go.

"“Has-been hip hotel> avoid unless someones paying for you” ok, gotta admit on first glance this place is a haven. the lobby and decor is STUNNING, now if only their rooms had the same spaciousness and style!
First, the rooms were awkward and small. Even the larger rooms. They were very overpriced, compared to some other places that are just as hip but larger like Hotel on Rivington. 
The LOCATION drove me nuts, I suppose some people like being up on Columbus Circle west side, but I really am not into that area. I prefer it lower and quieter with better shopping.. 
the ROOM SERVICE drove me nuts. 14 bucks for some chicken broth they called soup, I returned it immediately, but not before fighting for a refund.. argh! I want to feel like I'm doing them a favor by staying here, not vice versa! Terrible experience, I was there on three seperate occasions over past 5 years and its gotten worse and worse. 
The BAR , while very stylish and impressive on first run is full of yuppie scum that never grew out of the eighties so the music revolves around that image. I would want a bar like that to play some laid back [and quieter] electronic music, maybe some nice jazz fusion, but its all pop and disco.. arggh! I was too ashamed to bring my friends down there..

"“Ignore the bad reviews!” Firstly, I am really surprised by how some people seem find it difficult to research their hotel before they travel. The Hudson Hotel doesn't pretend to be anything else other than a hip and trendy – and if you were to check out the hotel's official website beforehand, then you would be able to suss this fact out.
Add to the mix that The Hudson Bar is renowned in Manhattan for being 'cool' and a 'place to be seen' you begin to get a measure of the place before you've even stepped on to the plane!
I was very worried about some of the complaints that had been posted, especially about the size of the rooms and the attitudes of the staff – but I needn't have been. We stayed on the 23rd floor in a Deluxe room (which wasn't much more than a standard) and there was plenty of room! I could seriously have swung about 3 cats around it! Yes, I have stayed in much bigger rooms, but it was completely adequate for our needs, very clean and decked out to a high standard. People who complain about the size of the TV and the toilet need to get out more! I don't think I switched the TV on once during our 4 night stay. You've come to NYC to go out and about – not sit in your room ordering room service!
The staff were friendly too and were quite happy to help whenever you asked for it.
Go there, enjoy and try not to let small details drag you down, the location is fantastic, right next to Central Park, Columbus Circle Subway and about 10 mins walk to 5th Ave, and Times Square. The Cosmopolitans in the bar are also very good!

"“Good deal, great location” We got this hotel via Priceline and then read all the negative reviews. We were expecting the worst, but we were pleasantly surprised. The room was small, but not nearly as small as some NYC hotel rooms. It was clean and had a warm, friendly feeling. It was also quirky--there was a ""window"" from the bedroom area into the shower--you could lie on the bed and watch someone in the bathroom if you were so inclined! It made us laugh every time we looked at it. We also LOVED the location. The Columbus Circle subway stop is just 2 blocks away, as is Central Park, there's great shopping right across the street, and two 24 hour diners within a block of the hotel. We steered clear of the nightclub/bar downstairs because that's not what we were there for, but it didn't cause any issues. Yes, the hallways are dark, but I never felt like it was dangerous in any way. The staff was super nice and friendly--no issues there at all. There are doormen waiting to hail you a cab at all hours, day and night. My only complaint is that the high speed wireless internet service, which I paid $10 per day for, was AWFUL. The signal was so weak that most websites timed out before they ever loaded. I called support at least twice and they tried to tell me it was something wrong with my computer (I have WiFi at home and it's never an issue).

"“Trying too hard to be funky & failing on comfort & service” This is a self-consciously trendy hotel with a real wannabe vibe. The are too few staff for the volume of visitors and thus the service is below par. The standard rooms are quite tiny, which is OK since in New York one is generally out and about. However, the beds are not comfortable.
The design of the hotel's public spaces is great, the Library became my favourite hangout. The location is also good, on the edge of Hell's Kitchen & Central Park west - close to museums and conveniently close to Columbus Circle subway station for trips up & down town. 
But overall I would not stay at this hotel again and I would recommend against it for the following reasons:
* poor service, too few staff for the number of visitors
* uncomfortable beds - mine squeaked whenever I moved as well
* tiny standard rooms - even by New York standards they are tiny
* self consciously trendy wannabe vibe - the place is just trying too hard to be funky
* very expensive & slow wireless internet service - US$10 per day for Roomlinx superslow connection
* no shower caps in the bathroom
On reflection, if visiting New York again, I would stay at the Library Hotel (where I stayed last year) rather than the Hudson as the rooms there were more comfortable and the service was better.",lfjkfiutnt,2007-03-01,223023,2007-03-11,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

Location is good, and taxi drivers know it so its easy to get back to
hotel has a nice ambiance, though the bar does get v loud you cant here it from the rooms - nb this is one of the places to be seen at the weekend, people que for hours to get into the bar and restaraunt but as a hotel uest you have a card and get waved right through
rooms are small but well designed and immaculately cleaned - if you are large you probably would want to upgrade as the bathrooms are snug, but otherwise all in all v good
think rack rate is fairly typical for ny, but expedia etc usually have it on something good
only downside was the lack of signs so you can stand out as a first timer (thoughstaff were friendly and approachable), and the sometimes longer wait at reception, but you could express checkout and would have no issue

"“Great Weekend at the Hudson” If you're fed up with your average hotel room, where they all look the same (think Bland) and when you wake up in the morning you have difficulty remembering which city you're in, then the Hudson may be for you. Bland it is not. Stylish, yes, with attitude!
As other posters have noted, you might walk past the entrance as there's no sign. But as you ascend the escalator to the gorgeous lobby, you know this is going to be different. 
The place has been designed down to the smallest detail - and given the size of the rooms, it has to be the smallest detail! Yes the rooms are small and yes, you will need to be tidy as there's no room to leave all your stuff lying around. But it's all beautifully done.
The staff were fantastic and the one meal we had here was excellent.

"“Stay there, have a drink elsewhere!” This is the preferred Priceline hotel for this area in New York. Always check Priceline first before booking.
I agree, going in you have to take this escalator but then the place is gorgeous, whether the main lobby, the reading room or the restaurant in the back. I liked it a lot! it is hip and so what!
The problem is the rooms, they are gorgeous, very stylish, white linen etc.. the bathroom gives through a window on the bedroom, so it could be sexy if used well:). However the rooms are TINY, but literally, there is no room for 2 suitcases! Even if you bring down the wall between 2 rooms, they remain small... Too much. 
Breakfast price is a rip off.

"“Painfully minimalistic” I love hip hotels. Unfortunately this one is created by Photoshop! It looks really cool on the hotels website, but reality is rather sad.
The two rooms we rented were the size of an average scandinavian toilet. TVs were smaller than screens of our PC. Heating system in one of the rooms was so noisy than we have given up on it. It killed the noise coming from the disco (which stayes open until 03.00). In the other room the heating system didn`t work at all and february in NY can be quite cold. If you would like to unpack your suitcase be aware - you need to hang your clothes on the wall. 
I must say the breakfast bufè was really nice and the constantly apologising receptionists are as helpfull as the could be, but it is just too much noise there even to have a conversation.
Location is good. Take turn to your right for nice lunch and try to find Putanesca - really nice italian restaurant couple of blocks away.
Definitely not a place for families with kids, those who travel with luggage as there are no closets in the rooms.

"“Misleading” Having recently returned from a 5 night stay at the Hudson I must admit I have mixed feelings about the hotel, the experience was interesting to say the least. First impressions were good, the Hotel lobby is a pleasant place to be, the check-in queue was efficiently managed by one of the managers and, as that morning there was a temporary problem with the lifts, she arranged for us to be taken to our rooms in the staff elevator, so far so good. Now for the rooms, they are small. The previous posts on this site are all pretty accurate, there is no room to unpack, hang clothes, leave any personal belongings lying about or do anything other than lie on the bed. The heating was two settings, “Freezer and Furness”, there is no happy medium and sometimes only the Furnace setting worked, we had to leave our window open one night which didn’t help with the noise issue (see later). The rooms and bathroom felt very claustrophobic. The walls between the rooms aren’t the thickest and we were on the 17th floor and could still hear the street noise from below. In addition to all of this a $30 charge has been made to our credit card, despite querying this at the time with the hotel and being assured that this charge was made in error and would be removed.
However, I feel everything needs to be viewed subjectively, you don’t go to New York to spend a huge amount of time in your hotel room if you are then you’re heading to the wrong city. The location is pretty dam good, a 2 min walk and you are in Central Park, with a subway station on your way, 5mins – 10mins and you are in Time Square, four blocks straight over and you arrive at the top of 5th Avenue and Tiffany’s. Top tips for places to eat near-by come out the hotel and turn left, cross over and there is a Restaurant called ‘Whym’ absolutely fantastic, just down from that is the Morning Star Diner which is excellent for breakfast. 
All in I was disappointed with the Hudson, the marketing literature I felt was misleading and needs to be viewed with a pinch of salt. In general the staff were excellent but this failed to make up for the enclosed feel of the rooms and the environment within them. But as I said you don’t go to NYC to spend a lot of time in your room.

"“bad bad bad” I stayed twice at the hudson. Once in a tandard room and it was so small it was unbearable: the second time in a luxury room 50% more expensive and there was not noticeable difference. 
The bathroom is so timy you bang your head all the time. There is no real closet to put your clothes. The TV is approximately 6 inches. 
I am 6 feet high. I can not make it . it feels like Alice in Wonderland (nightamarish part of it).
Service is bad, mechanical, when provided. As no one was answering the phone at the reception when I called from the room. After calling for 15 min, I decided to call with my international cell phone to try to reach someone: Unbelievable!
Breakfast for 1 : I paid 42$ for a very average breakfast. I decided for the menu as the buffet was more than depressing. Service in the restaurant was non existing. The following days I went to the dinner round the corner . much better. 
Decor of Lobby and bars is impressive but dated and the clientele now tends to be college kids for Spring break. 
And all that for not cheap - even for NY standard.

"“Is it a hotel or a nightclub?” I stayed one night at the Hudson Hotel in August last year as part of a business trip. First impression isn't great because you have to go up an escalator to reception. The reception area lighting is very dark, which actually made it difficult to find my credit card when checking in! However, it looks fabulous. Elevators were terrible - a long wait and a long line of people waiting. My room was tiny...very claustrophobic and would have been horrible for staying more than one night. It also didn't have a bath tub. My room looked out over the internal atrium, which was also where a bar was. I had to get up at 5am the next morning to catch a flight home and was kept awake most of the night by the music from the bar. I'd gone out for the evening and fancied a drink at the bar on my return, but the velvet rope was up and I felt too intimidated/untrendy to venture in by myself. It was interesting, and the place looks fantastic, but I won't be rushing back.",TBUK,2006-08-01,223023,2007-02-23,False,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Simply too hip.” Ok, so the Hudson has an attitude. You have to be in the know to even find it because there are no signs on the street. Or, perhaps you're supposed to spot it by the crowd of teenagers hanging around at the entrance waiting for, well who knows, perhaps Godot to show up at the bar? The multiple lobby-level bars overflow into the main lobby where it is virtually impossible to carry on a conversation over the din. Heaven forbid one checks in during peak party time (most of the evening and wee hours) because it would be simply impossible to fight your way to the front desk with bags in tow to merely check in. Forget bellmen, they seem to be partying with the rest of them. Bouncers ensure that the elevators are for guests only. Or, perhaps they are keeping the elevators away from the guests because the elevators have more square footage than the typical room. The rooms are tiny even by Paresian standards. There should be a height maximum to sit on the toilet because 6 footers need not apply. Room lighting is too funky to describe and the biggest window in the room is between the shower and the bed. Presumably for practicing exhibitionists. Bathrooms are so small that hair drying requires one to be double jointed. The halls are painted in institutional gray and look like a prison. I've stayed in worse hotels, but only in third world countries. It's a must if you're single and into the bar scene, but think again if you're a traveler.",misdirected_baggage,2007-02-01,223023,2007-02-20,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Perfect for a quick 'tourist' break” My fiance and I stayed at the Hudson in December '06 when we went to NY to do Christmas shopping. We checked in late on the Friday night - staff on duty were very nice. I didnt find noise to be excessive at all, despite a very loud bar downstairs. Although I did read the reviews on trip advisor, I was still a little shocked at how tiny the rooms were! It was kind of funny actually, you have to hand it to the designers, they really maximise the available space and it is decorated in a very clever way. My fiance is 6'2'' and he managed to squeeze into the bathroom without too much trouble! There was a bit of a space problem when we brought back our shopping, but a bit of tidying up and re-organizing the suitcases took care of it.
On the down side, the bed was not too comfy and the heaters were a bit noisy - but it was no big deal. The hotel was so stylishly decorated, I was in awe. Its quite nightclub-like, a really different experience. 
The staff were very nice, contrary to other reviewers experiences. I'd say that if you are in town for a short break and you don't plan on spending much time in your room, yet you want a cool hotel, then the Hudson is an option for you. We did not eat at the hotel at all or drink at the bar, we went out. Coming from London for the weekend we wanted to maximise the NY experience and see different parts of the city.
It is a short 10-15 minute walk to 5th Avenue shops and 2 minutes to Columbus Circle's small indoor shopping mall. Cabs are plentiful outtside the hotel. 
Its definitely not for a 'spoil yourself' weekend away treat , nor for those who like space and quiet, or for business travellers. Also not for children. Its a young, hip hotel, and as functional as a Starck design is intended to be!

"“Bar is GREAT - Rooms are so so” The Hudson is definitely showing some wear and tear. While the downstairs is super sleek and thumping music oozes from the bar, the rooms themselves are just OK. In a word, everything is TINY. Tiny bathroom, tiny tv, tiny closet. It's fine when i go for business and it's just me, but I would not recommend for a couple. Plus the walls are paper thin (not uncommon in NYC). The biggest issue I have is that the carpeting in the halls is just plain dirty.

"“Overpriced and Overrated” My husband and I travel extensively and decided to stay at the Hudson the week of January 7th. I had some pretty good expectations of the hotel, after viewing the website. The lobby and bar of the hotel was fine, but the rooms are so small that I actually hated to think of having to come back to my drafty room when it was 20 degrees outside! The bathroom was even smaller - you have to squeeze between the toilet and the wall to allow room to close the door, and the desk in that room wasn't enough space for 2 laptops! 
The customer service was truly lacking. We asked for room service, which came late and the waiter at the Canteen was almost non-existent. I love the night life, but I paid for a room, not its bar, and expect more from a hotel that charges $250/night. Well, I would at least like to fit my luggage through the narrow hallway of the room, which itself was a huge overtaking!

"“Too trendy, but great for singles” You walk into an amazing lobby, its cool and stylish and you feel like you have entered someplace very special. The staff dont seem too intrested but at this point who cares right. After a few days the moody staff got on my nerves. They seemed to be there to look good first and serve you second. The same in the bar, very keen to take your coat, so the place looks good, but not too keen to sell you a drink....servers were rarely seen. Better go straight to the bar, beware the prices i think 16 bucks for a glass of ok wine is way too much. The place is happenin on a saturday night, but if your a resident be prepared to have to show id when you get back at night before they will let you into the lift. The pool table and the study area is good for a chill out. I heard the rooms were small as they generally are in NY, but i wasnt really prepared for just how small....especially the bathroom was a joke. Dont even think of staying here unless you are alone and like lying down a lot. Lots of funky stuff like cd players make up for the lack of space eventually you get used to the size, but if you're only staying for a short time and looking for something special....dont stay here.

"“Electric shock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Well what to say, just got back from New York New York (08-02-07), I loved the place, I'm 31 and expect good service and friendly staff, I could'nt have asked for more. The bar is great though they do tend to put reserved signes on everything, just tell them to stop being silly and have a drink. The room was the loft suite, so I thought loft and top of building went together, I was wrong, the room was fine if your happy to hang everything and leave the smalls in your bags, it could do with somewhere to put your pants and socks but hey I'm sure Phillip dos'nt wear them so why should I???.
Be prepared for a massive electric shock when you call for the lift, the static that my girlfriend and I where getting was painfull, we ended up using our elbows, when I mentionened it to the very sexy staff with there short skirts they had never heared of it.

"“Stay Away from This One. Not Fit for Purpose.” My wife booked Hudson for a weekend of January 26, 2007(ufortunately, without reading any reviews). We had a really bad experience for one night and then checked out and moved to Mandarin Oriental across the road. The problems were as follows:
1. Drafts everywhere in the hotel (think NASA wind tunnel). From the front door to the escalator to the front desk the wind was very stong.
2. Uneven temperature throughout the building. Some areas like the front desk (where they had to put up heaters behind the counter to keep the front desk stuff from freezing) were really cold, others were too warm.
3. Rooms are super small with about 1' of space between the endge of bed and walls and beds are REALLY small. I am 6'2"" and the so called ""king"" bed was about 1' short for me. Also, the bathroom's size was so small I can't really find the right words to describe it. I felt caged there.
4. Windows in the room were not sealed properly and as a result there was a BIG draft onto the bed (yes, we had to slip in a reverse position, it was too late to change rooms and judging from other reviews other rooms had the same problem). Actually, it was the first hotel I saw anywhere in the world where bed's head is against the window.
5. Hotel is very dark (think Medieval castle) and stuff were not very friendly. We waited about 10 min for a host to seat us for a late nite cup at around midnight, and he/she never showed up, others pretended they did not notice us. At breakfast, our waiter was more concerned with us paying the bill then good service (yes, we did pay eventually -))).
5. Ah, yes... the toilet...when I flushed it... Well, it just filled up. Being fair to the engineering stuff, they fixed that problem promptly, but it was a bit too late for us anyway. We already decided to run away.
6. At check out, the front desk gave us the bill for somebody else. With full name, address details, etc. Think identity theft.
On balance, our one nite stay was terrible. Some here say that the hotel makes you feel young. True, the night club is VIBRANT. But one does not have to stay in the hotel to enjoy nite life there. If you can't afford Mandarin Oriental (US$699 per night) there are several other moderately priced hotels in the area, which are FAR SUPERIOR to the Hunson.",Soloreux,2007-01-01,223023,2007-02-06,False,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Get over the tiny rooms - this is a cool hotel” Yes: the rooms are very very small. But anyone who did ANY research whatsoever before they blindly booked a hotel room would know this before arriving. The hotel website has the sq footage of the rooms and also a virtual tour so you can see a camera pan the room of your choice. Therefore, when I got into my room, and it was tiny, I was like ""wow - this looks just like it said on the hotel website.""
That said, this hotel is perfect for a weekend stay where you arent going to be spending that much time in the room. Truth be told, if I had been spending much time in the room it would have been way too tiny. But we were in the city to hang out with friends, shop and go out in manhattan, so why would I be sitting around my tiny room?
Other plusses: the room is really sexy. If you're going with a significant other, note that. The scene in the hotel is as described by other reviewers. Posh and you feel like a celeb. Helpful staff, great service. My heater wasnt working when I got there, they came up and fixed it in 30 seconds.
Location location location. Right near amazing shopping, and a subway stop that will get you wherever you need to go.
I would stay at this hotel for the decor, the club scene, and even the tiny weird sexy rooms if I wasnt going to be couped up in them.

"“I would never spend my own money to stay here...” I would never spend my own money to stay at the Hudson Hotel, and was pleased that on this trip I did not find out the hard way like so many of the people I heard complaining about the rooms at the reception desk.
The hotel has a great location on 58th Street and was designed by the famous designer Philippe Stark.
From the moment that you arrive you know that you are going to a hotel like no other, as there is no name to identify the place. You then travel up some very long and striking yellow light escalators and emerge into a gloomy lobby. Music is pumping away and you really cannot see very much as it is very dark. You can make out a huge long check-in desk with a massive trendy chandelier hanging above it.
As you check in you will usually hear people complaining about the size of their rooms and the staff explaining that the rooms are that size and it is not just that they have been allocated a tiny room. I did think that people were probably being a bit fussy and over dramatic, until I went to my own room. Getting to the room was another surprise as the hallways are incredibly dark as well.
The rooms are very small, around 125 square feet. If they were very cheap then this would be less of an issue. But they are not. On the positive side they are a masterpiece of clever design by squeezing so much in to such a small space.
But no matter what your view on design is, the fact is the rooms feel cramped and unpleasant to stay in. The dark wood panels making it feel oppressive. There is around 1.5 feet on either side of the low bed. The bathroom is hard to move around in as you squeeze past the toilet to get into the shower that has a glass panel into the bedroom. There is a small TV and a CD player in the room – but no real space to put luggage and much clothes. If there were 2 of you in the rooms it would be really cramped.
The restaurant in the hotel is also dark, but here the design is very stunning with the kitchen in the centre and long tables. The food is excellent. The buffet breakfast ($27) was excellent as well.
The main bar on the lobby level has glass floors with light underneath. They are very fussy about keeping the look and would not let us put our coats over the back of the chairs. There is also a “library” that is also great design and more comfortable.
The fitness room is pretty good with a fair selection of cardio machines and weight machines. The meeting rooms are very ordinary considering the rest of the hotel.
As you can imagine, I will avoid staying here. I had to stay in the hotel for 4 nights and that was too long!
You cab see from the pictures I posted on here just how small the rooma are. You could also look at a video I took of the room by copying and pasting this link to a new browser:

"“The best part about the Hudson Hotel is the bar” If you plan on staying the Hudson bring black clothes and giant sunglasses because that seems to be the uniform of the guests who stay there. When my taxi first pulled up I thought I was stepping into a nightclub. Then the escalator takes you straight up ot the lobby where the ivy covered glass ceiling is an incredible sight. The bar with its blaring club music, lighted floor and $14 drinks is a very hot see and be seen location. They also have a gigantic outdoor roof bar with seating areas - it was too cold to enjoy during my stay but during summertime it would be incredible. But then, there's the rooms...TINY! I actually laughed out loud when I opened the door. While the decor is really cool, there is less than one foot of room on each side of the bed. Plus the bathroom is so small I had to step into the hallway to blow dry my haIr. So if you're more interested in ""the scene"" than you are creature comforts, splurge and stay at the Hudson..

"“Fantastic Location” So I had read most of the reviews already posted for this hotel so I expected the small rooms etc but overall our stay was fantastic. We stayed 2 nights over a long weekend, it was perfect. Any longer, the very small room may have gotten annoying as we could hear plenty of noise from adjoining rooms and also the windows were not very well insulated as the street noise was pretty loud. The check in was effortless and the guy - Daniel was very helpful and nice. The guys at the bell hop on the other hand were awful, so slow, one guy just sat behind the desk the entire time and didnt lift a finger to help the others. After we checked out and went back later that day to pick up our bags, the guy was way too chirpy and almost laughed when we assured him we didnt need a taxi, that we were taking the subway back to the airport.
The atmosphere is definatly for younger people, very trendy and dimly lit. Saturday night it was buzzing with people. It is in a fantastic location, right next to the A train at Columbus circle which we took advantage of.

"“Perfect for two twenty-somethings!” I booked with Hotwire.com and received a 3.5 star hotel for $133/night in Midtown Manhattan, which I was very pleased with. I was even more pleased when I discovered it was the Hudson. Then when reading reviews on TripAdvisor, I became somewhat 
worried that the Hudson was not going to live up to my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised by my trip this weekend!
My husband and I love architecture and design, and the Hudson wowed us completely in every respect. The rooms are small, yes. I had no problems however with the bathroom size (no knees hitting wall when using the toilet, and my husband is 6'1""). 
The beds were very comfortable. Also our room was quiet; we never heard any other guests. We had a double bed size room, which must be the smallest room. The check-in clerk was friendly; we arrived early for check in at about 1:30 PM. We were able to leave bags with the bellhops downstairs and returned for check in at 3:00 PM, when our room was ready right away. 
I enjoyed the facade of the hotel as it is not labeled as a ""hotel"" in any way. All the desk staff we worked with were friendly, except for one time I called the concierge to find the address of a store I wanted to visit. I either misunderstood the address or was told the wrong address, but eventually found the spot. Checkout was very easy as well. 
The room was spotless each day after cleaning, and all the small details and places they found to place things in the room were very inventive. Even though it was Manhattan, prices in the vending machines on each floor were reasonable, at $1.00 - $1.25 for snacks. The minibar prices are clearly marked, so you will know how much it is when you take it. They have even explained the prices of things in the room like the iron, the pillows, etc. so you will know what they'll charge if you take it. The pillows, by the way, were excellent and very comfortable.
S
o, for two design-concious twentysomethings, the Hudson was absolutely perfect. If you are looking to spend all your time in the room, then find somewhere with larger rooms (but be prepared to pay $300-$400 and up/night depending on location!!). We had such a great time, and we really felt the hotel had been designed with people our age in mind, which is extremely cool to see for a change!
I hope if what you are looking for in a hotel is great design, fairly good value for Manhattan, and an excellent location for a weekend getaway, then you'll try to look past all the reviews from people who did not know what they were getting into with the Hudson.

I don't think any work has been carried out on the hotel and it is in need of a little touch up here and there.
I know the rooms are small but that doesn't bother me, they have everything in there you need but when 2 out of the 3 light's do not work its impossible to see anything in the bedroom. I reported it to the desk and they did try to fix one of them but it broke again the next day.
The vent in the bathroom was also a problem as this was hanging loose and as for the air con/heating, it was quite a suprise at 2am each morning to be woken up by what sounds like workmen in your room banging pipes at least it only lasted 10 mins each time.

"“The Torch burns at the Hudson...” I have read all the reviews just stayed here Jan 10th-14th. Yes it's true the rooms which are not suites or upgrades are small. Picture a twin size bed with 2ft. on either side to the wall. Bathrooms=smaller than small. Yes, I too hit my knees when on the pot. See thru shower glass door, I liked it. T.V. was 12"", room does have a nice little stereo-bring your own CD's Decor.-well..The honest truth is this hotel does cater to people of the ""alternative"" life style. If that is your style then you will most likely enjoy your stay here. I was okay with it. Spoke to a manager about the pool- not done, won't be anytime soon. So there seems to be maintenance issues. Yes-the rooms are drafty. It's either hot or cold-hard to get a happy medium. Had to use a knife blade to turn on the heat because the switch was broken. We were on the 10th fl. and could hear people talking on the street, construction, taxis, sirens, and someone kept slamming a door in the hotel-it shook our door everytime. Bed=way uncomfortable-springs in the back! And about 1ft off the floor. The night-club was a happening place to be-but I agree with one reviewer-doesn't matter if you're a guest-the line to get in was nuts. Pluses=clean, trendy, location, maid service was great, helpful staff, great library w/fireplace. Eat at the Morning Star across the street-about $22 for two. Save money-buy snacks and drinks at Duane Reade Rx. This was my 4th trip to NYC-sorry but could not and will not recommend this hotel to any friends. Only stayed here because Hotwire had a rate of $125/night and owed me $100 for another not so great hotel. It's too bad too.

No, the scene at the very cool looking bar doesn't interest me (my husband and I had our drink in the quieter library, late in the afternoon, and long before the party crowd had arrived). But it makes me feel good that I could go there if I wanted to.
It doesn't hurt that the staff was incredibly warm and helpful (far from the icy demeanour you often encounter in design hotels) -- or that the cocktails were wonderful -- or that the beds were very comfortable. Yeah, the rooms, especially the bathrooms, are tiny, but the rest of the hotel puts you in the right mindframe to work around that.
OK, so my husband and I were headed for the opera rather than the club scene (the Hudson is perfectly located for those headed to Lincoln Center), but we felt so much younger while watching it than we would have if we had stayed somewhere more sedate.
P.S. The lobby can get very busy on a Saturday night, but it was very comforting to see that the hotel staff checked for room keys before allowing anyone up in the elevators.",theresama40,2007-01-01,223023,2007-01-14,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Poorly run hotel. Bad rooms.” This is not a well run hotel. I checked in and the first room I was given was drafty. Actually, drafty is not a strong enough word. There was a full wind blowing into the room around the window and the heater did not work. I was able to exchange the room, but the front desk lady spent 5 minutes complaining to me how they can never get the engineering people to fix the rooms (sounds like they have this problem a lot). Second room I was given was hot. The thermostat read 81 degrees and the AC didn't work. It was late and I didn't want to move rooms again so I stuck with it. It was better than the freezing cold room I originally had. On top of the room being hot the door to the bathroom was broken. It was one of those sliding doors and it was crooked. I couldn't close it. Fortunately, I was the only person in the room, so I left the door open. The next day the maid came in cleaned the room and left the door as it was. They obviously saw it but no one cared enough to fix it. Terrible.

"“50/50” We stayed at the Husdon for 5 nights over Christmas as part of our honeymoon. Although I read the reviews before I went I didn't think that the rooms would be THAT small!
When we walked into our room (if you can call it that!) is was very small and not suitable for a 5 night stay. Luckily we were able to get an upgrade to a slightly larger room.
The room was cleaned daily. The bathroom was very small with my husbands' knees touching the wall when he was on the loo! And if you are a shy person then make sure you pull the curtain accross the glass wall sperating the shower from the main room!
Stay away from the mini bar, at $6.50 for a snickers bar you are best going to the 24 hour supermarket at the end of the street.
The communal areas of the hotel are great. Very stylish and uber trendy! The library was a nice place to relax, the bar was very good for people watching. The restaurant is an experience as it is an open kitchen, the food was very good.
Overall the hotel was OK. We only really used the room as a base so the size did not worry us too much. The nice communal areas were better for relaxing in than our room. 
The location is good. About 5 minutes walk to Central Park and maybe 15-20 minutes walk to Times Square.

Bathroom was large.. had a bath and loads of room so no complaints and no see through wall / shield that others had mentioned.. We had a proper door!!
Very trendy, modern bedroom, bathroom and communual areas.. Really fab!1 Drinks not too pricey.. approx £5 so not cheap but not crazy. Food ex in the kitchen too and well worth eating there.

Staff were helpful, breakfast was nice and the bar area is lovely. The only thing I will say is that there isn't any tea/coffee making facilities in the room which is a must for me.

"“Stop in, get a drink, admire the decor then move on” The Hudson Hotel is a visual feast. The decor is truly original and transports you to a fantastical land where the best designs from the ages convene. But the rooms are conducive to neither sleeping nor living. And since a hotel should excel at both, I'd agree with other reviewers who've basically likened the Hudson Hotel to a ""club with rooms.""
Two things to note:
[1] Room = Coffin
Unfortunately, the rooms (bathroom included), although well designed, reminded me of highly stylized coffins and the hallways were straight from a scary movie; long, dark and hinted at impending doom. Actually, a coffin suggests silence, but a room at the Hudson is anything but. Needless to stay, after a long day working in the city, I did not look forward to returning to my accommodations.
[2] The Bar Rocks
The bar at the Hudson Hotel is pure fantasy. The illuminated floor panels, the renaissance-like painting on the ceiling and eccentric mix of lounge furniture create an atmosphere entirely worthy of the New York scene. Also take a look at the library. Pick out a book and sink down into one of those plush leather chairs by the fireplace.
Oh, and interestingly enough,when you drive up to the entrance of the Hudson Hotel you'll notice that there is no signage indicating that you are in fact at the Hudson Hotel. (All of Ian Schrager's hotels follow this protocol.) 
Save your money. Just go for drinks and take a look around.",roguemh,2002-10-01,223023,2007-01-04,False,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Tourist Trap Hudson” The Hudson has pleasant communal areas, the rooms are tiny but stylish. My problem with the Hudson was the way they dealt with payments and charges. They put a hold on my cc for double the amount of the room - it took 3 phone calls to get it taken off. We had $45 of minibar charges - we didn't use the minibar (these were taken off when we complained), my i-pod went missing from the room - we complained they sent back a very formulaic email. valet parking was $46 per day! - the most I've ever paid in NYC. I have stayed in many NYC hotels and this totally put my back up.

"“Cute, sexy, little rooms for those who won't be in their rooms much” My boyfriend's mother gave us a night at the Hudson as a gift (along with theater tickets). We loved the place. The entrance is very cool and the lobby is impressive. We arrived at noon and had no problem getting a room despite a 3 PM check in time. The desk staff was cheerful and chatty...happy to talk about favorite pizza places and breakfast spots.
I'm a native New Yorker and knew that our room would be small. It was extremely tiny, but I liked it (maybe that's that's the little girl in me coming out...mini = cute). The bathroom is definiately interesting with the transparent wall between it and the bedroom, but that keeps the tiny room from being too clausterphobic.
There were a few nice touches: lots of lighting options, mini-shelf system with cassette and CD player (and good speakers), and full cable (not just a few channels). Perhaps we were lucky, but we never heard a peep from the other rooms. Elevators were quick, security was great (checking key cards at night to make sure the only people getting into elevators were guests or were with guests).
The only draw back would be the service in the ""yellow"" bar and the volume on the music in the bar, lobby and elevators. Definitely club style...loud and techno-ish. Our waitress at the bar was pretty stupid not to stay on top of us...we were prepared to have a few drinks and wound up leaving after one. About 30 minutes later, we went out to get drinks elsewhere and saw our empty glasses still sitting on the table by the couch were we lounged.
The Hudson's location is fantastic. Down the street from Columbus Circle, there are plenty of inexpensive food options within one block. Check out the nice Whole Foods in the bottom of the Columbus Circle mall if you want a quick bite (don't go after 5, when lines get long). Times Square is just a few blocks away. 
For great pizza, go left out the door and go down 8th Ave a few blocks to Sacco's. The atmosphere is nil, but the pizza is great. For breakfast, hit one of the Cafe Europa locations that are in the Carnegie Hall area (two blocks east of the hotel).",JeanninePC99,2006-12-01,223023,2007-01-03,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great Location, Bad Hotel!” As I preface all my reviews- I come from a hotel background and can be overly critical but even to the untrained eye this hotel needs improvement.
I due give kudos to the staff, they were very friendly, knowledgable and did not give off that NYC ""I am superior than you"" vibe. 
While I did like the motif of the hotel, I did feel as if it was a young hotel trying to impress everyone by going a little over the top. Example- the Hudson bar- I loved the lighted floor, and the ceiling was impressive but it was low, so much in fact I felt very closed in the room when I looked in it.
The room: 150 sq. ft for $400, not good. My Fiancee's knees hit the wall as he tried to use the toilet. The one redeeming quality was the open shower, where you can spice up your night by watching your loved one take a shower.
I do realize that hotel rooms in NY are tiny but as my Fiancee observed (and I shoudl say that he is a corrections officer) that the room was about the size of one of the cells at the prison he works at.
I can't say anything about the food or services as we did not eat at the hotel nor had the opportunity to receive any hotel services as they were busy getting ready for their NYE party with Christina Aguliera. While I slept fine and did not hear any noise from the party I wish I had been told about the party when I had called the hotel. I felt like an intruder when arriving back at the hotel and having to go straight to my room instaed of being able to have a drink in the bar due to the party. Not very good hospitality if you ask me, the hotel guests should at least have had the luxury of using the facilities, especially after paying so much for what in essence was a ""jail cell"".",Canynn,2006-12-01,223023,2007-01-03,False,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Very Stylish but tiny - had to use restroom downstairs” My fiance and I were initially excited about staying there - the Hudson is a cool night spot with a nice lobby and exterior. As you enter through the doors, it feels like a club, with no hotel name on the outside and a long escalator up to the lobby. The elevator walls was one of the coolest things in the hotel - a great texture.
When we got to our room, initially it looked really cool. The decor is great, only there was barely any space to put our bags down. The walls and floors are all wood too, which made the room really cold and clammy. We also coudn't find the TV at first - it's hidden inside a side cabinet. 
However, the worst was the bathroom, which looks deceptively cool and modern. It's so small that it was difficult to use the restroom or even brush your teeth. I'm 5'1"" and my knees hit the wall. My fiance had to go downstairs to comfortably use the restroom.
I don't recommend this hotel unless you don't mind staying in a small room.

"“Not good” Recently booked a room at The Hudson over the December 2nd weekend. Arrived early - 11:00 a.m. The front desk person booked us into the hotel, but explained the room was not ready and he would hold it for us during the day after it had been cleaned. He was aware that it was a special Birthday weekend trip. Shopped all day and enjoyed the city as planned. Had a special birthday dinner arranged with friends for 9:00 p.m. Returned to the hotel with plenty of time to dress, shower and get ready. Entered the room to find it completely a mess, no maid service, a big smokey ashtray in the middle of the bed, sheets thrown all over and the room filled with smoke. The hotel had screwed up the maid service for this room. - Long story short .. I have stayed at many Morgan's Hotel Group Hotels around the country. Never had tried the Hudson because I had always heard bad reviews of the hotel. Finally decided they could not be that bad because the Morgan Hotel Group of Hotels is very nice and decided to ignore the hear say. Guess what? I should have listened to the reviews. End of story is that The Hudson could not do anything to help us by putting us into another room, they could not get our room ready with any speed, or urgency. I told them to find another hotel and I moved to a much nicer room at a different hotel. Did not make it to the dinner party. The night did not go well ...

"“Miniscule rooms, fab location” Stayed here for business for two nights right after the Thanksgiving holiday. The reception staff was friendly and helpful and the restaurant (I think called Cafeteria) had great food. the location is superb and I would love to come back for a stay to go shopping/sightseeing with my husband.
The room was very small, smallest I have ever stayed in, including cruise ship rooms. But, the room was clean and efficient and did it's job. Not a hotel I would stay at for leisurely relaxation, but perfect for a couple's sightseeing trip or a business trip. If I were bringing children, I would stay elsewhere as room too small, hallways too dark, and lobby too clubby for little ones.
Two areas for improvement: Bartender in the library bar was rude beyond reason and so impossibly snooty I could not fathom his tips to be overwhelming. Left after the one drink as the treatment was unforgiveable. The other area was delivery of my suitcase by the airline was mishandled. I informed the staff upon checkin that my bag was to be delivered late that night by the airline and I needed my clothes for business meetings the next morning. They informed me I would receive a call when it arrived. I called the front desk the next morning and was told that I would have been called had it arrived so it must not have arrived. After lengthy calls to the airline and the delivery company the airline used, I was assured that the security had indeed signed for my bag several hours earlier and to check with them....of course, security had it the entire time and I had never been informed.

"“Do Not Stay Here” PLEASE DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL - IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT IT WILL RUIN YOUR STAY IN ONE OF THE WORLDS GREATEST CITIES.
writing this report is the first thing I have done since arriving home, which should give you an idea of just how bad an experience we had at the 5 star (ha ha ha ha) Hudson Hotel. If i can persuade even one person not to stay then it is a worthwhile exercise. I could list so many reasons for slaughtering this hotel but heres a few key points:
1) the rooms are SHOCKINGLY small. I am truly amazed that they have passed legal requirements. 
2) the prices of everything are INSULTING. 
3) the amenities are a bad, bad joke. We had NO free wireless in room, NO wardrobe, NO chest of drawers, NO fridge. The hi-fi was so old that the cassette deck was the main feature. The tv was cheap, old and tiny. The double bed was the smallest I have ever seen and the bathroom was no bigger than a decent sized wardrobe.
4) I like dance music, i like clubs - however I don't appreciate heavy loud techno blaring until 3 or 4 in the morning every night - just below my room.
5) you can literally touch the snobbery and arrogance. If you are not wearing Gucci you don't belong here. 
The Hudson hotel may look amazing on their website, and the entrance/terrace/public rooms are stunning, but don't be fooled as we were. We were so looking forward to experiencing NYC but our trip was scarred by utter disappointment after 4 days in the most pretentious, overrated, overpriced, insultingly small-roomed hotel I have ever had the displeasure to stay in.
However, If you are a hobbit that enjoys eating pistachios at $10 a handful and washing it down with warm mineral water at $6.50 a bottle whilst calling a landline locally at $8 a minute then you might love it.

"“We liked it!” I stayed here for a work-related meeting this past weekend and took my teen daughter. Some reviews had me worried, but since I had no choice about the location, we mentally prepared for small rooms and dark halls. Both were true, but many other negatives I read were not experienced by us.
There was plenty of shelving and closet space (both open-style; no bureau/doors) Bed was comfy, if rather low-slung. We appreciated the ice/vending directly off the elevators on each floor. The escalator from the street level to the check-in desk was no big deal. It gave us a sense of safety by having the security folks checking to make sure we were hotel guests before entering the elevators during nightclub hours. The nightclub atmosphere was REALLY loud in the main lobby, but I heard nothing in my room and I'm a light sleeper and we were very close to the elevators. The a/c unit was rather loud in a white noise sort of way.
Dear daughter was freaked out by the shower being glass all the way around so that I could see her in there while sitting on the bed. Yes, w/she used the additional curtain inside the shower, but it still gave her the creeps. Good for lovers and voyeurs, but not a teen with her mom. No frig, no coffee maker, and ice buckets are only found by the ice machine.
We found many drug stores, food markets and cheap ""eats"" within a 3 block range along 9th Ave. We loved Puccini's restaurant on 9th and 55th - only about 8 tables, BYOB, and wonderful pasta (& other food) at cheap prices and only open for dinner.",PennStater84,2007-08-01,223023,2007-08-27,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The young staff was quite aware of the shortcomings of the hotel. Also, the hotel is very difficult to find. There is no street address, no title and no markings ANYWHERE. Good luck in finding it.

"“Hip Hotel - Awesome Location” This hotel is located on 58th between 8th & 9th (Columbus Circle) and is a 1 minute walk to Central Park and an 8 minute walk to Times Square - IT IS TRUE, the rooms are not the biggest in the city, but this hotel has PERSONALITY and the BEST LOCATION! We were upgraded to what amounted to the 3rd category from the bottom (Superior Queen) and the room was quite comfortable and COZY. As I mentioned there are 2 categories of smaller rooms, so I imagine those could seem somewhat less comfortable and even more cozy. We booked through PRICELINE and paid $129 a night from Dec 17 - 20, and this place would have been worth double that to us! Our room was a VERY CLEAN corner unit with 3 windows (1 in the bathroom). The room consisted of a hallway leading to the bedroom with a closet containing a rack and hangers, 150 sq ft room and a bathroom with standup shower that was plenty big for both of us. Pictures of this hotel on the net are accurate, with a beautiful lobby which is located at the top of the escalator, as well as a nice lil outdoor sitting area with lots of furnature. The hotel transforms at night to a bit of a club, with cool bars and lounges playing hip-hop music, which are popular with the 20-40 crowd (we are in our 20's). Other things worth mentioning, the AC and the HEAT worked well in our room and it was nicely appointed. The halls are a bit dimly lit but that wasn't a problem. The mini bar was WAY OVER PRICED so you may want to stay away from that, though there are 2 drug stores 30 seconds away as well as a Starbucks, a PIZZA shop, 2 sandwich shops, a hotdog cart, and the beautiful TIME WARNER building which contains a 4 story shopping mall across the street from the hotel.

"“Sexy but expensive...” We recently stayed at the Hudson as recomended we booked a larger room which is definitely a must, especially if you can get a corner room. The hotel is stunning and all the staff are beautiful and also very helpful. At night the place is very loud as towards the end of the week it really is the place to be with a guest list to get into the hudson bar! Only negative with this is that after ten at night there is no where to go for a quiet drink as the whole place is running like a night club. We were lucky enough to visit some great places in NYC and there drinks are all cheaper than the Hudson! Make sure you stipulate exactly what you want or you will be paying for Grey Goose all week! A great place to go and feel cool and sexy if you are prepared to spend big, certainly not for the faint hearted....the new restaurant is also very cool but style certainly comes before substance with the dishes looking great but tasting very average. To sum it up if you are looking to live it large this is THE place to stay if you're not you would be better looking elsewhere and visiting for the night....",Sar-and-Nels,2007-08-01,223023,2007-08-20,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hudson = an Experience” Read carefully: The rooms are small! Please check in to the hotel knowing that the rooms are small (standard Queen room is approx 150sq ft). Although this is a trendy/chic hotel do not expect opulence and luxury. 
The good thing about the hotel is the location (across the street from Whole Foods and the Columbus Circle Shopping Center). Damo Damo Sushi bar is about 50 ft from the Hudson's doorway, and a CVS Pharmacy is diagonally across the street.
Another good thing is that the hotel common areas are really spectacular. The 15th floor sky terrace open 10am-10pm is very comfortable and quite nice. The Hudson Bar is very exclusive and is really jumpin' in the evening/late nights.
My advice to you, pay extra for the Deluxe room with a living room because it's roomier and a great size for a couple. If that is out of your budget, check out the Jumeirah Essex House or Le Parker Meridien...they might have cheaper standard accommodations and roomier rooms.

"“Strangely Considerate of Toddlers” We landed the Hudson Hotel on a Priceline whim after deciding to escape from Thanksgiving family drama. Got in for $115 including taxes - a steal, considering it was the holiday weekend.
There's decent garage parking nearby, so you don't have to pay the valet. It's kind of hard to find the front door, but once you get over your MIB-esque feeling, you still have to ride the mile-long escalator to the main lobby. The entire time we're going up, I'm thinking we're reliving Night of the Living Dead - goth, dark, creepy.
HOWEVER, (and this is the reason I'm putting them down as excellent), after a 6 hour drive with a screaming toddler, we were clearly tired and exhausted - and the front desk was well aware of our long day (I guess we looked horrid compared to all the other guests just getting the night started). They gave us a free upgrade to a corner suite, which included a nook for our son's play pen, sitting area with couch and coffee table, TV, king bed, separate bath and shower, entryway, and plenty of room to spare.
I was a little intimidated walking into this hotel with a stroller and diaper bag, but found everyone to be very helpful and keenly aware of our situation. (Maybe it's because we stuck out like a sore thumb.)

"“Not THAT bad!!” I stayed here for 3 nights with my 8 year old daughter. YES...the room is VERY small. We went on a cruise in May and the cabin was actually bigger. But for us it was Ok, because after hitting the city all day we were exhausted every night and just crashed. The bed is very comfortable. The a/c worked fine. The weird thing was the glass window around the tub with a curtain so you could watch your roomate use the shower if you wanted. WHY? And By the way, there is no sign on the outside of the hotel telling you that it is the Hudson, so thankfully I recognized it from the pictures. Also,there is NO place to put your clothes. No dresser, no drawers in nightstand. Nothing. There is a place to hang a few things-we had about 8 hangers, so we had to leave our stuff in the suitcase which is ok for a long weekend. Staff were friendly. Concierge was able to print our boarding passes for our trip home. Hailed us a cab. Loud music in lobby nightly from the club but didn't hear it in the room. We were on the 14th floor. There's ice machine and vending machines on every floor. 15th floor has the Terrace with nice scenic views and a place to relax if you get claustrophobic in your room I guess. 
Great location next to Columbus Circle subway stop. Central Park is 3 minute walk away. 15 -20 minute walk to Rockerfeller Plaza and Times Square. 24 hour CVS on the corner. Cute diner called the Flame was nice for breakfast. 
Overall, I recommend it for a short stay when you just need a place to lie your head at night. Fine for one person, with 2 you tend to trip over each other.

"“A Phillip Starck masterpiece” The hotel is in a central location and is fabulous inside with a very anonymous entrance and a neon lit escalator that takes guests up into a fabulously designed hotel lobby. 
The early 20th century brick building lends itself to the softly lit seating areas scattered around, the double height library bar, the excellent grill and fun cocktail bar. All the areas were very comfortable as well as stylish. The hotel has two ousdide courtyards: one is on the 15th storey and has wonderful city views. The hotel staff are very helpful and efficient. 
The rooms, however, are very small. You could say small but perfectly formed as the decoration, fittings and bedlinen are all of a high standard. But not for the claustrophobic or tall/ large guest. The rest of the hotal though is so good that I would want to be in the public areas rather than the room! my advice about the room is to chose one that overlooks the inner courtyard as they are quieter - the hotel is close to Columbus Circle and therefore busy roads.

The Hotel is very modern and clean, yeh the rooms are small but how much time do you spend in your room when your in a city like New York!!!!!!!!. We had to wait only five minutes to check in and because of the tiny wait we had they immediately upgraded our room without us even mentioning the wait, and then proceeded to give us a free breakfast the next morning which was delicious. All the staff were most helpfull, and on hand to help at all times. We didn't get to sample the bar as there was so much to do but the music and decor looked really funky.

"“STAY AWAY -- Not worth a fraction of the price” Got cheated out of a proper holiday this year so spent for three nights at the Hudson what we'd normally spend on a week. Great weekend but the Hudson was AWFUL -- the biggest disappointment in a very rich travel life. For almost $500 per night, we got a tiny room with no bathtub and a dark non-view of the courtyard. 
A former New Yorker had recommended the Hudson based on the chic lobby and bar, which is all you should bother seeing. For all the vaunted design touches, they all-too-often fail in the function department. 
The funky lamps in our room were too dim to illuminate a space only four feet wider than the bed. In the equally dim elevators, the floor numbers are brass on brass and people had to get down and squint to see which button to push. Our room had no dresser -- just an inconveniently high cubby hole from which you had to pull down all the items to find the one you wanted. 
Also, the air in our room was painfully dry -- like being on an airplane -- so much so that my upper lip swelled up!
My sister spent similar cash at the Tribeca Grand this fall and her experience was much, much better. Go to the Hudson to look around the eye-catching lobby, buy an over-priced cocktail in the bar so you can scan for stars, then go somewhere with value for money to rest your head for the night.
Only the location was good.
p.s. Not to cast aspersions, but I find the raves about this hotel highly suspect, unless the posters are rich and can afford a bigger room.",davefromtoronto,2006-11-01,223023,2006-12-12,False,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.3,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“NHbTS: Nice Hotel but Terrible Service” In Hudson I had my worst experience of staying in a hotel. The hotel (public areas, room, etc) was just fine, beautiful design especially the private park, but it was the service that was BAD. 
Let me explain! We arrived at the hotel (at 20:00) after a 24 hours flight and planes changes when the reception just told us that our VISAs (three of them) were declined. We were very tired and started to be worried. We could not contact our bank because in our country (due to time difference) everything was closed. But we used our credict cards on the airport, the mini bus transfer, some shops and they were just fine. So, we did not sleep that night and at 02:00 we went back to the reception, contacted our bank (it opened by that time) and assured us that there was not any problem with them. So, we asked them to try them again, but they could not use them since they were declined and we had to wait for the next day. We still was tired and nervous. We went again back to the reception at 07:00 in the morning and our credit cards were declined again. We were desperated. We could use them all over New York but not in the Hotel. We contacted our bank again to tell us once more that our cards are OK and there is a problem with the hotel system which did not sent them enough information. So, we then tried to find ATM to get some cash, cancelled our fisrt day programme in the city and when we came to the reception with the cash, they just wanted 150 dollars per night for incidental charges (mini bar, telephone, etc), that is 8 nights X 150 = 1200 dollars. A BIG AMOUNT. In no other hotel I was asked to do this. Anyway, we gave only 150 after a long discussion because simply we did not have any more.
After we settled down our accomodation we had a great week in NYC, we calmed down. And... at the check-out, 03:30 in the morning we went again to the reception to ask for the 150 dollars back and the lady there simply told us that she could not give them because there was a problem (?) with their system. And our taxi was waiting to get us to the airport. By that time I got very nervous and started to complain for everything and after 10 minutes she just gave us our money back.
I do not know, but all this experience was very stressfull and we could not expect it to happen in a hotel. I do not know who the fault really is but since we could use our credit cards in the city, I come to the conclusion that the hotel's system is not compatible with credit cards from all the countries, something they should have taken care of. Finally, even if we liked the hotel, we will not stay there again because now we know they do not accept out credit cards !!!",GEOMELIN,2007-08-01,223023,2007-08-12,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Like a club with a sleeping room” People are very confused about this place! Here's what it is all about: the entire lobby, bars and restaurants turn in to a gigantic, dark club at night. It's an amazing transformation. You can find a place to talk softly, or get very involved in some more lively activity. It differs very little from paying $20 to get in any other hip sort of club downtown. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you are already going to enjoy this hotel. The fact that it has sleeping rooms is almost a bonus! When you're tired of the club scene, or just want to refresh, you go to your room, and it is quiet. Let me talk about the rooms. Yes, they are small, but they are very nice and cozy, in a smart, artful way. The only thing that detracts from this hip sort of environment is the dirt-cheap electronics....an tiny, aged tv and a Walmart clock. Everything else is great. The rooms are small, I must emphasize, but that's not the point. The point is that they are quite smartly designed, really different. Now, about price: here's my best tip: go to Hotwire. This is the only upper west hotel that has 3.5 stars. So, if it is available, you'll probably pay $200, not $500. This hotel is not worth 4 or 500. I hope I've helped. If you like this sort of place, you'll love the hudson. If you are not in to a downtown kind of intimate, dark style, you will hate it.",glazen,2006-12-01,223023,2006-12-08,False,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Super Stylish BUT .....” Fantastic Hotel in terms of Interior Decor BUT .... we got there exhausted from an early start in London, flight etc and the girl on the desk didn't even direct us to the lifts after we had checked in!? The main reception area is just amazing but BEWARE! They swiped my boyfriends Credit card ( although room was pre paid) for $900, in case of incidentals. Concierge guys were v. helpful and friendly. Prices in the bar EXTORTIONATE! Mediocre cocktails. We sat there watching people walk into the bar and then walk out again after they had a)seen the prices and b) the precious atmosphere put them off. We had 4 cocktails for $68.... we only convinced ourselves to go there because of the GBP / dollar exchange rate. The bar looks really cool but it had an atmosphere of trying to be cool .... with the most uncool crowd I have ever seen. Have been to Soho House and its not this expensive!! LOVED the room! No space to swing a cat but clean with a great shower. Avoid the minibar at your peril unless you want to pay $9 for a packet of gummi bears ( there is a 24 hour pharmacy selling them for $1 if you fancy some, less that 1 minute walk from the foyer. Didn't bother with breakfast as there is a diner on the corner (opposite pharmacy) ... avoid the Saffee cafe on same road as hotel - they didn't speak english and the order was all wrong- plastic cutelry and no coffee refills. There is a st*rbucks down the road too :0) Fabulous location ( 4 minutes to the park and all the main shops - Bergdorf, Tiffany etc (SIGH!)

"“Not overly keen” Bits of the hotel were great. The staff were nice, and the bar(s) and eating area were great (the included breakfasts filled me up nicely). However I was disappointed by the room. 
I didn't like the decorations, it seemed rather moody and miserable. The room wasn't huge, but I don't mind that too much, and the beds were quite comfortable. The bathroom was a bit lame - It was all there but didn't impress.

"“Hmmmmm” We arrived at midnight to find our room was unavailable as people had stayed on for an extra night! Instead we got put into a room that gave a new dimension to teeny tiny and could hear less tired people partying in the bar. The following night we got a less tiny room. To be honest, the Husdon has a lovely bar (although expensive) and as a crash pad it ticks all the boxes. Comfy bed, good shower, cable TV and clean. The location is good and the staff I dealt with seemed pleasant enough! If you're an early bird, make sure you get a room above the 7th Floor as you'll probably be able to hear the music from the bar.

"“The Best Hotel Experience Ever” I'm just back from my first visit to NYC, and our experience of ths Hudson was fantastic! We researched everything before travelling, including reading nearly ever review on TripAdvisor. A lot of the feedback was negative, but we took the gamble. It was worth it!
We booked directly with the Hudson, who also arranged for pick up at JFK. 
Every member of staff inclduing the door staff, front desk, concierge, bar staff, lift staff and cleaners were all the example of customer service excellence. They were helpful, friendly, informative and made our experience extra special.
The hotel design is modern, contemporary, very typical of Starck. I particularly liked the garden area. We opted for a slightly larger room, which was plenty big enough if not slightly lacking in clothes storage. We did have a slight problem with hot water, it took around 5 minutes to warm up, but certainly never effected us!
The bars were always great for socialising, and definitely the place to be seen.

"“Loved the Hudson, great value” What can we say, but a great hotel for the price. Got off the subway at 59th Street by Central Park - a straight single ride for $2 from JFK plus $5 for the Skyride at JFK - and only an 800 yard walk to 58th Street/8th Avenue and the Hudson. From there it is a 10 minute walk down 8th Avenue to Times Square and 15 minutes to the Empire State buiding. Room is small but by no means tiny as we have been in many smaller room and in New York all you need is a good, clean room and the Hudson certainly is both of these. If you take loads of luggage you will find hanging space a problem, but few people go to New York with ball gowns. Bathroms are very different with excellent fittings and beds are huge. We found the staff very helpful and not at all brusque as some others have said. Didn't eat or drink there as the prices are sky high, but there is a great diner - The Flame Restaurant - which serves great food at excellent prices just around the corner and a great deli - the Bread Factory Cafe - on 8th Avenue serving great deli food. There are also supermarkets around to buy cheap booze so you will not go dry. We would fully recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a hotel that is easily accessible by subway, near Central Park and within reach of all the sites.

There are no drawers or wardrobes, nowhere to put your clothes etc, there is hanging space but who hangs their knickers up? We ordered room service on arrival, the food was fantasic but ridiculously overpriced.

"“Claustrophobic rooms but cool hotel” The Hotel Hudson is a sleek, hip hotel in a great location near Columbus Circle. The hotel is so hip that there is no sign on the front of it (or even a building number) - you just have to ""know"" that you have arrived. The lobby and bar feel like a trendy nightclub, with ultra-cool decor and 24-hour lounge music. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are modern and Zen feeling, but VERY, VERY SMALL, even by New York standards. Our room felt like a closet - there was only enough space for a double bed with two feet of floor on either side of it. There wasn't even enough space to lay our suitcases on the floor to unpack them. There was a tiny TV and one tiny desk to put our belongings. The bathroom was so small that my knees hit the wall when I sat on the toilet (I am average height). I would not recommend staying here if you are claustrophobic.

"“Avoid the Hudson!!!” Hudson looks cool but that's where it ends. The concierges are fine but the rest of the staff did not impress me. Restaurants are outrageously expensive and there is no padded seating except the outdoor bar, where you cannot order snacks. Hallways have no carpet and are so loud that I couldn't sleep--housekeeping staff gabbed loudly day and night at the far end of the hall, and slammed doors constantly. Rooms are super-small and look clinical, all white with one aluminum chair that was freezing cold. Could not change the temp in the room. When I pulled the cord to turn the light on over the bed, the cord broke, so no light. Bathroom shower is nice but the room itself is so small that, like others on this forum have said, you have to climb over the toilet to get to the shower, and every surface is splashed with water from the shower--it's like taking a shower in an RV where the toilet is right in there with you! To top off my two sleepless nights at the Hudson, for which I paid $285/night + tax, I left a pair of brand new $300 shoes there, and when I called as soon as I got home, they said none had been turned in. In fact, they denied that their housekeeping staff could possibly have stolen them. Well, they DID steal them--who else would have gone into the room after I left???--so I am out another $300.

"“Looking for Unique, Cool & Hip?” I stayed at the Hudson Hotel when I took my 12-year-old daughter to NYC for the weekend. I took my chances with a hotel using Hotwire.com, not knowing what I would end up with. We were pleasantly surprised. GREAT LOCATION! The hotel is unlike any other I've experienced. The ambience is created with warm woods and low lighting. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Yes, the room was on the small side but I was very impressed with the design. The bathroom was not the smallest I've been in either, also finished with good design. The only caution about the room would be that it really wouldn't have been able to accommodate more than one large bag. 2 small bags, OK. On Saturday night, the main level of the hotel turns into a nightclub and is quite the Scene. It did not interfere with the room's privacy at all though. The staff were so friendly that when I was checking out, the clerk thanked me when I knew where to go in the hotel to leave my bags for the day. I would not hesitate to stay there again.

The bathroom is also small - When I sat down my knees almost touched the wall. But to be honest with you everything was there that you needed for a short break. I was there for a weekend so it was fine. I had never been to NY before and the Hudson was just a place to shower and sleep while I exlored during the day.

"“Beauty is only skin deep” The charm of this property ends with the decor, which is lovely but not enough to outweigh the minuses. 
The bathroom is so small I couldn't sit down on the toilet. I had to step over the toilet to get out of the shower. The door to the room sticks open so I slept my first night with my door open, then had to bodyslam it to get it to shut thereafter. There's an iron but only a table top ironing board and not enough outlets. You can't keep your laptop and your iron plugged in at the same time. Got a Blackberry to charge too? Fuhgedaboudit. Ladies, don't bring dresses or a coat because once you put your suitcase in the ""closet"" (the only place it fits) there's no room for long hang anything.
The desk chair in the room is made of aluminum so dress warm to work there. If you get tired of working in your room (or perhaps claustrophobic), don't go to the lobby, restaurant or bar. The ever-present techno soundtrack is so loud you can't hear the person you're talking to on the phone even with the earpiece in. Besides, the restaurant food is mediocre anyway.

"“never again” I have literally just got back from a stay in New York at the Hudson. I was there for 6 unwelcoming, uncomfortable and noisy nights. I had trouble booking a hotel for this trip, as New York is getting busy with Christmas shoppers, there was the marathon and also Veterans Day – so the Hudson was a last resort.
I have stayed there before for a two night weekend break and it was “ok”. This time it was close to purgatory. I arrived at 2pm to be told my room wasn’t ready and was met with a “no there is no possibility to have another room that is already ready, we are fully booked.” The room or should I say cupboard was tiny and also on the 8th floor like a reviewer before. The window was so small it didn’t bring any light into the room and the shower room (no baths here) so small I had to sit on the loo sideways as my legs didn’t fit! (and I’m only 5” 5)
Issues:
•I only had two hangers on the rail that sufficed for a wardrobe – I asked for more but it took over 2 hours. 
•The water was cold in the shower and wouldn’t warm up so they had to come and fix it.
•The air con was noisy and howling – so they came to fix it. Afterward only icy cold would work so they came again. In the end I had 3 visits about the air conditioning.
•My room phone didn’t work – this took me going down to reception twice before it was fixed.
Every time I spoke to reception about the above they barely acknowledged me. I was not rude or impolite but the front desk staff made me feel like I was asking too much to have it sorted out and unreasonable to ask for it to be done quickly.
The 8th floor is too close to the bar and the street noise – so I used ear plugs every night. 
The bar is good if you’re with a group friends and like to shout to be heard over the loud music. The Canteen is fine – food is good but its communal dining.
There are so many better places to stay than at the Hudson. If I could have moved hotels I would have.",Peagreen98,2006-11-01,223023,2006-11-17,False,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Probably better off staying at the Y” I had to stay at the Hudson because my trip was at short notice, and there seemed to be hardly any rooms at all in the city. The Hudson looked cool, so the agent booked it - more than $500/night.
When I checked in (at 3pm) I had to go straight to a meeting, so asked for my bags (quite a few) to be taken to my room. They refused, and said I needed to carry them downstairs myself to hand them to the doorman who would deliver them to my room when I returned, which seemed unhelpful and an unnecessary hassle.
An important (but unexpected) fax arrived before I checked in, but I wasn't told about this when I checked in, it wasn't delivered to my room, and there was no message left for me on my phone. Perhaps I was supposed to guess that I had a fax waiting for me. When I discovered it was there (2 days later) they refused to bring it to my room and I had to come to the lobby to get it myself. This seemed unhelful and an unnecessary hassle (again).
There is no coffee machine in the room (there is very little of anything in the room) which would matter less if the hotel offered 24 hour room service, but it doesn't. With international travellers suffering from jet lag, it would seem a small thing to add (but given the size of the rooms, they may have to sacrifice the bathroom). The ironing board looked like something out of a childs toy cupboard. Given the small size of work spaces (covered by other posters) it is a real challenge to find a surace large and stable enough to balance it on. Incidentally, every single thing that is not nailed down has a helpful little tag attached to it cheerfully reminding all guests that if they like it enough to take it with them they will be charged the GDP of a sizeable european country. I appreciate the assumption that all guests are kleptomaniacs - puts a guest firmly in his/her place early on.
There is no bathrobe (remember the price of the room), it is virtually impossible to find anything if it falls on the floor because of the poor lighting. The fixtures and fitting may look pretty, but are flimsy and not designed for 'industrial' use - the shower came away in my hand. The water pressure is poor, the beds are small, the TV reception is terrible on most channels, there's hardly anywhere to keep anything if you want to unpack your bags, there's no fridge, and a bottle of water is $6.50.
For the size of the room, quality of the fixtures & fittings, the standard of bathroom, and the lack of sound proofing, you might be better staying in the YMCA. Certainly a lot cheaper. And the staff are likely to be better and friendlier.

"“Only go if you are a trendo-zog from the Planet Black Suit” My relationship with this hotel got off to a bad start when the car I had booked through them failed to appear at JFK, the hotel proved difficult to raise on the phone and, finally, when spoken to, couldn't locate the driver. They also failed to call me back...but this turned out to be because the concierge did not know how to dial the UK phone number I had given her!
I should have read the signs, but I ploughed on naively.
I arrived at the hotel at about 8pm and ascended the escalators at the entrance to the lobby which was reveberating to achingly trendy, tub-thumping music. It appeared they couldn't decide whether to be a hotel or a nightclub.
I got my room key and,since it was now nearly 1.30am UK time I staggered to my room. It turned out to be sited at the end of a five minute walk along three corridoors to the nether depths of the eighth floor.
The door was part of several sited on a corner next to each other, which was not promising.
The room turned out to be so small it did not seem possible to have put the bed in without assembling it in the room. It had two single windows, neither of which faced the bed. This faced a wall on which had been placed a curtain to disguise the fact the otherwise the room would appear to be a prison cell.
The main function of the windows appeared to be to let in the disastrous traffic noise from the street outside.
In despair I called reception and asked if I could be moved to a quieter room on a higher floor. I even promised them filthy lucre.
They were 'fully booked, sir'. 'Are you facing the street sir?' [don't they know their hotel rooms?] 'yes, that is noisy. We could move you tomorrow to a room facing the atrium. There's a bar at the bottom but it closes at 1130 and at this time of year people don't hang around outside'. [ok, not filling me with confidence] 'oh, and ,sir...' [what now?] '...we can only move you if you make sure all your things are packed when you leave tomorrow. Otherwise, you'll lose your room' [Blimey, this IS a prison. It even has rules for the inmates].
In desperation I called another hotel and asked if they had any cancellations. They had a room. I booked it (the rate was offensive, but I was now ready to book any rate if I had to) and rushed down in a cab. The room was (a) large, (b) on a high floor and (c) they were really nice. The woman on the desk was a bit terrified when I told her I wanted to hug her, but she just figured it was jet lag.
My plans to be in bed early and stay on UK time were in a mess. But, finally, I was in a decent hotel room (at vast expense no doubt) in a hotel where they give a [--] about their guests.
Only go to the Hudson if your interest in hip-ness so outweighs all of your own human needs that you are prepared to pretend you are enjoying being treated like the pointless excreta of the human race.

Luckily my husband & I are relatively small people, or else we wouldn't have fit in the bathroom.

"“Style over substance” Firstly, lets do the good points... The Hudson has a great bar, (but that in itself attracts locals and tourists from other hotels, thereby making the hotel lobby busy and you have to reach your room before you can relax). Also, its undoubtedly a very stylish hotel. Classy decoration all round.
Now the negative points. The rooms are horrendously small. I stayed there by myself on business and I could get by, but I'd never return as a couple. I'm 5'10"" and could touch both the side walls of the room at once! The view from the bed was through a glass wall into the bathroom - classy! The bathroom barely had enough room to turn around in, and there was no wardrobe to speak of. Or any drawers.
My air-con was noisy, and dripped when turned off. The TV was tiny, and generally it wasn't a room that I wanted to stay in for longer than I had to.
The whole building seems to have been designed to favour vampires or those who enjoy dark confined spaces. Its impossible to see down the corridors and people continually bump into each other in the darkened lobbies.
Staff are generally helpful and courteous which is nice.
One of my main gripes though came after I'd checked out, which was when I found an extra $50 thrown on to my credit card. It seems that this is common practice based on the experience of my work colleagues that have stayed there. When I called to question the amount I was told it was to cover an item in the mini-bar, which I hadn't even broken the seal on. They quickly refunded the amount in a 'win some, lose some' manner.
I won't be keen to return.",CitySlicker123,2006-10-01,223023,2006-10-25,False,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.7,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Style (or so they seem to think) over any substance” Was in New York for a long weekend with my mother and my sister and were looking for somewhere central and a bit different. While we had taken note of the fact that the rooms were small, we figured since we only wanted somewhere to sleep and shower, we'd be ok. As others have mentioned, the common areas of the hotel are so dimly lit as to be uncomfortable, and have sufficiently loud music in the evenings as to render comfortable conversation impossible. The bathrooms are so small as to be almost dangerous. The water out of basins in some bedrooms comes out brown (my sister complained and was told that this was a hotel-wide problem so there was no point in switching rooms - the problem did clear up the following day). On three out of the four days I was there, the shower was tepid despite running it for a while. The bottled water in the room costs $6.50!! Thank goodness for the CVS across the street where you can buy it for $1.57. 
All of these problems were irritating but liveable with. The REAL annoyance however, are the staff. It seems to be a condition of employment that you think you are are astonishingly rude. Once I found the concierge to be helpful but otherwise, the service was extremely irritating. For instance, I asked for something small to be mailed within Manhattan and was told that as the packaging clerk didn't come in until 10am my only option was Fedex. No flexibility and no customer service. And whatever you do, don't leave anything at the hotel. Trying to get it back is almost impossible! I do a lot of travelling and have stayed in a lot of hotels over Europe & the US. I will not be going back to the Hudson.

"“Gimmicky and overpriced” I stayed at this hotel in the fall of 2005 two separate times when I was in town on business. While the hotel bills itself as a boutique hotel, the rooms themselves resemble tacky/gimmicky dormitory rooms. One of my rooms barely fit a double bed, and the other had the bed pushed against the wall, with barely enough room to squeeze my suitcase standing up! I ordered room service in the room and ended up eating it on my bed, as there was no where else to sit/eat. Also, both rooms have bathrooms that are overly designed, difficult to use, and bare wood floors that have seen better days.
The lobby/bar area, however, is still pretty happening, even though the hotel itself has seen better days and the celebrities have stopped coming (or so I hear from a friend who used to bellboy there).

I am very easy to accommodate and realize that running hotels can be a challenge. Overall, I'm a pretty flexible guy and simply enjoy different hotel experiences.....until now.

I would just encourage you to read the other descriptions in this section and beware that they are so small you literally cannot take 2 steps in any direction without hitting a wall (I'm truly not joking). Above all, the service is arrogant, pretentious and borders on offensive with social wannabe's in thier 20's pretending to be so cool that you and your $300+++ room rate are not worthy of their time.

"“Hated the Hudson” We should have listened to tripadvisor.com! 
My wife and I went to New York for a romantic weekend and we nearly wound-up having to stay in two double beds. I reconfirmed the reservation the day of our arrival and everything sounded good. I had upgraded our room to a loft so we would have extra space in this notoriously small hotel. When we arrived at 9pm we were told that the guests before us hadn't checked-out so we would be ""downgraded"" several categories and a room with two double beds was all that was available. The desk clerk offered us drink coupons and free breakfast as an apology. After 30 minutes of frustration with an unsympathetic manager named Kye they ""found"" a room with a queen bed. When we went upstairs and opened the door we found two blowers in the room and the housekeeper informed us it had been painted that day. The front desk informed us that was the best they could do. Nothing like sleeping surrounded by paint fumes. 
We woke up with headaches but tried to make the best of it. After an afternoon of shopping we called downstairs and the desk clerk said a bellman would be right up to get our luggage and move us into our originally reserved room. Thirty minutes went by and no one came. I went downstairs, cut to the front of the line and demanded keys to the new room. 
After complaining again the next morning, we were given a significant discount to our first night's room rate. A few days later a call to the general manager's office was returned with an offer of a free stay the next time we were in New York. A nice offer. But we will not be staying at the Hudson again.",advtravel,2006-10-01,223023,2006-10-15,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Small Rooms in a Big city....” We stayed in the Hudson from Friday Oct 6th - Wednesday Oct 11th. We did some homework on this hotel so we knew what to expect. Decor wise it lived up to its expectations. The main problems we encountered were the lack of co-ordination and management of the check in area. There always appeared to be a large number of people waiting. The people behind the desk, were mostly friendly but stretched and stressed and there didnt appear to be anyone in charge who could co-ordinate what needed to be done. Over all from the door-man to the cleaning staff most people we encountered were friendly and polite. 
Now I turn to our ""box"" for a room! Ok, I have stayed in many hotels around the world and a hotel in Amsterdam was holding our record for being small but the Hudson takes the award by a mile! It was tiny! Now again we did look into the hotel before booking it so we knew it would be small but you really dont get a feel for the size of the room until you get in there. It is a room ""not"" to stay in for any lenght of time, just to sleep, shower and store your bags nothing else. The interesting and unusual ""window"" beside the bath/shower looking onto the bed took a bit of getting use to. If your'e into exhibitionism then by all means keep the curtain open so your partner can see you shower as they relax on the bed! The space provided for the TV, CD player, safe etc does what its supposed to ""store out of sight"". Dont go near the sweets or water left for you as even the small bottle of water left on the table was $6. There are plenty of stores near by so go out and buy your own bottled water and candy if you so wish. Overall this hotel served its purpose, sleep and shower nothing else.

"“Stylish, but not for everyone” I had fun staying at the Hudson, but probably won't go back. The property is gorgeous; the highlight is the high-design public spaces with all kinds of interesting touches. The rooms are beautiful and stylish. The staff is friendly, although a little disorganized (checking out took me nearly half an hour). The hotel is incredibly convenient to just about anything you might need.
That said, while the hotel is stylish, it's not very comfortable. The rooms are very dimly lit and have few available surfaces; I had to move the (overpriced) bottled water just in order to have enough space to put my laptop on the desk. The rooms are tiny; I was fine staying solo, but when a friend arrived it was awkward space-wise. The public spaces are loud and crowded in the evenings. Also, when you arrive, there's no sign outside-- so if you don't know exactly what you're looking for you won't necessarily know you're at the Hudson.
If you want to stay someplace with beautiful public spaces that's conveniently located, the Hudson is fine.

"“Loved the Hudson in NYC” Friends and I were in NYC (some) for the first time. By glowing recommendations we booked our stay at the Hudson for 3 nights/four people sharing one double room. We booked directly through the hotel and they were very friendly and efficient. The rooms were exactly as described to us, average size for NY, a remarkable good use of space, a sharp design and amenities that met all of our needs.
 If you blink you will miss this hotel, it is a 5 minute walk to Columbus Circle itself and the CC subway stop. Keep walking and find the south end of Central Park, Times Square and the Met. Right outside the door is a great little deli with everything from soup to nuts. This came in handy as there is no food/coffee served in the hotel except for premium items ordered though room service.
As my friend put it, ""at night, this hotel turns int o a nightclub"" . It does. The entryway off 58th St is only recognizable by a bright stream of neon green light that spills onto the sidewalk. Go up the escalator and your greeted by a vine covered ,glass atrium & sprawling, wood planked front desk. Here, you can check in and/or take your pick of places to enjoy a cocktail.
Choices are plenty here. Tucked away is the sophistcated but swank Library Bar for a drink and a game of pool, the brightly lit ""main"" bar if you want to be seen (or see), one of a dozen private nooks for closeness or a lovely outdoor casbah- type garden (weather permitting) if you want an experience that falls somewhere in the middle of all three.
The hallways of the hotel are a tad intimidating as they are gunmetal grey and resemble those of a cruise ship and don't seem to fit with the rest of the hotel , but maybe that's the point...The rooms would be considered "" tight"" but as I said expertly designed. So much so that four girls had ample room for all of our ""stuff"". The bathroom is made spacious by use of modular/multipurpose furniture and smart fixtures. The mattresses/pillows were extremely comfortable and the linens were an above average thread count. 
 As far as service is concerned, in the morning we discovered that our shower drain was clogged so on our way out we let the staff know & not only did they seem embarrased but they promply apologized and the drain was fixed by the time they promised.

Booked thru Priceline for $145 a night at very short notice, we got a queen room (458) that was a bit larger than expected, perhaps because it was a corner room. The main body of the room was L-shaped, with a little hallway leading into the main room with the bed facing the bathroom, or more appropriately, the bathroom wall. No glass door here; there was actually a sliding door that shut the bathroom off completely. There was a 13-inch TV, a small stereo and three windows that let in a ton of sunlight. The bathroom wasn't sizable but it wasn't as tight as I was led to believe.
We didn't partake of the club or restaurant but I did do some exploring and loved the public areas. Service was friendly and it's very close to the Columbus Circle subway station, although it is closer to 9th Av than 8th Av.",jas044,2006-09-01,223023,2006-10-10,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Great Place” The Hudson Hotel is well located among New York's finest attractions. My wife and I stayed there for 7 nights for our honeymoon and really enjoyed the services that the hotel had to offer. Ok, so the staff have a little attitude problem and the rooms are small (but cosy), but it's New York, it's what you'd expect!! The rooms are very clean and nicely presented. There isn't much room to move around, but seriously, you don't go to New York to be stuck in a hotel room all holiday. The services that the hotel has to offer are great, cool bars and much more. If you are a business traveller i wouldn't recommend it, but honeymoon or getaways for sure.

"“great fun with a toddler” Really enjoyed the night I stayed at the Hudson and would recommend it for travelling with very small children (mine is 2.5) We got upgraded to an enormous room with two queen sized beds and a cot, and a little lobby for the buggy to be parked and an ensuite bathroom. Lovely views over Manhattan. Staff were gorgeous and everyone was incredibly helpful and sympathetic towards me (single mother), although they are a tad disorganised. Food was delicious and not unreasonably priced, cocktails on the sky terrace a bit ho hum, children not allowed in the gym swimming pool which you can get membership to (it's across the street), which was not what I'd been told, and there were various muddles like that. It's an immense skyscraper and the corridors are a bit spooky - at times I think the design crosses the line between cool postmodern and weird sinister but generally I had a blast here and would happily go again.",florencereally,2006-10-01,223023,2006-10-08,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“No one over 6 feet welcome!” If you booked this hotel thru Priceline (which I should've done), then for a night or two, it's fine for $150., where else in the city can you stay for that price? UNFORTUNATELY, we booked it directly thru the hotel for over $ 319. per night. We had a deluxe junior suite, which was quite small. An uncomfortable metal chair and a sofa makes this a suite. The bathroom is SO tiny, if you are over 150 lbs., (which I am not!), you won't be able to sit on the toilet (I don't sit on the seats anyway!!!). My husband is 6'5"" and honestly, could not squeeze into this tiny shower and bathroom. What a joke. There were no dressers to put your clothing, only a closet, so you live out of your suitcase. TV was tiny. Hallways are DARK and my husband's head hit the EXIT signs in the hall, no lie. If you are in your 20's this could be a fun place to stay and hang your hat. The restaurant was really fun, cafeteria style, great macaroni and cheese w/ truffle oil roast chicken. DELISH. Fresh tuna was excellent and good cocktails. The library and rooftop deck (though it was too cold to enjoy in the winter) is gorgeous. The hotel is aesthetically pleasing. Sharp, contemporary art and very funky. A good place to have a drink. Concierge and front desk were kids who could care less about their guests. Too many excellent boutique and chain hotels in the city for my $300+ per night that I would rather stay at.

"“Pretentious hotel, rude staff.” The Hudson Hotel is one of the most pretentious hotels that I have ever stayed in. Quite apart from the fact that is horrendously expensive and everywhere you go you're subjected to obtrusive just-a-little-too-loud trip-hop or world music, the staff are snooty, rude and unhelpful and I could almost touch all four walls of my room if I stood in the middle of it. It was clean, but smaller than some of the cupboards in hotels I've stayed in elsewhere. 
I'm a 28 year old that works in the music business, so I'm used to rude people, bad hotels and terrible music.

"“Hip Hotel for the Price, Tiny Rooms, Shabby Service, Killer Bar” I stay at the Hudson quite a lot for business. It's to my mind the only option on a certain budget if (like me) you hate Sheratons, Hiltons, et al. Room rates vary a great deal depending on length of stay and time of year, but when it's a sub $300 hotel- it's worth it.
The rooms are itty-bitty- ""have to leave the room to change your mind"" kinda thing. But they are nicely outfitted and the heating/cooling works. 
The cleaning staff are sweet and thorough. There are vending/snack bars with hangout areas on every floor. Room service is good food with awful service, and that's pretty much the general service level of the hotel. It's a very familiar experience, one which I call ""Ian Schrager Incompetence"". 
The bar is rocking as is the restaurant and guests get in, which gives you a place to go if you don't have/make other plans. It is no longer hipster central but it's certainly the fine.

"“Opinion from a trendy 26 year old” My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hudson on September 28th. I won the room on Priceline for $140/night so I was assigned to the standard room. I read the earlier reviews both positive and negative so I was curious to see what it was really like. I consider myself to be trendy and hip so I was looking forward to the atmosphere. The outside of the hotel, neon-lit elevator leading up to the lobby, the lobby and all of the other common areas are ultra-chic and impressive. The rooms on the other hand are very tiny as many other reviews have stated. My boyfriend and I thought it was hilarious, but we instantly felt sorry for anyone paying full price for this room ($289/night). We weren't even sure if we got our money's worth! The bathroom is minute and there is no way for two people to fit inside comfortably. I would definitely not recommend sharing this room with anyone that is not a significant other as it would be rather awkward. As I stated above, my boyfriend and I got a kick out of this room, until it was time to iron our clothes. The room had a mini-ironing board which made it hard to iron a dress and a long-sleeve short. Therefore, please do not stay here on business. The room was clean, but did show some wear and tear. I expected a room this small to be free of any imperfections. There were a few-pluses. The staff was friendly. When we checked out after a day they even joked about us leaving because the rooms were too big. All of the bar areas are busy all day and turn into a club atmosphere late night. This was definitely a plus because we were able to party and go straight upstairs to our room. Drinks are expensive, but we had a wonderful waitress. Bottom line: 1) Never pay full price for this hotel 2) Preferably, stay here alone, not on business, or for more than one night, or with alot of stuff to iron 3) If you want a cool party-hotel this is definitely the place 4) not for families",SDot1980,2006-09-01,223023,2006-10-02,False,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Walmart Quality, Ritz Priced” I was very excited to stay in the Hudson because of it's web site. It offered a modern, comfortable guest room that ended up being a cheaply decorated box with lousy service. The room was fitted with a full bed and low quality furnishings. The bathroom was rusty and although recently updated, not well maintained. I ordered a cot so I would not have to be squished in a full bed with my sister and had a horrible nights sleep because springs were poking me throughout the night. The worst part of the hotel was the unhelpful staff who were rude and condescending. We ordered a bottle of wine to the room and found out the next day the cash tip we offered in place of a charged tip was just an additional ten dollars for the deceitful bellboy. We were chraged an additonal 16 dollars for his tip and a delivery charge, neither of which was discolsed to us when signing the bill. When I inquiried about the bill the next morning the front desk woman replied impatient ly and was unwilling to help until I came to the front desk.

The whole ""understated"" exterior as someone said ""You don't even realize you are going into a hotel and then it just hits you"" is garbage.

"“We thought Hudson was great!” My boyfriend and I stayed here with some friends for a weekend of partying and shopping. For our purposes, it was great! If you are a business traveler needing ample workspace or a family with children, I would not stay here. This hotel is for the young and hip looking to have a good time. Yes, the rooms are small....but aren't we in NYC? I have stayed in smaller places. I guess everyone is different, but I don't mind a small room as long as it is clean and well organized. Our room was VERY clean and the bed was so comfy. We were only there to sleep and take showers. One other warning....If you are staying there with someone you might not feel super-comfortable with, you might want to choose another hotel. There is only a glass wall in between the bathroom and bedroom with a sheer cloth over the glass. For friends, or very close relationships, it is fine. If you have been dating 1 month....maybe not! Also, there is a great sandwich shop....if you take a left out of the hotel and walk to the corner and make a left you will see a sandwich shop with a yellow sign just a couple of doors down on your left. They make the yummiest, freshest sandwiches and soups....it is a hole-in-the wall, but great. We ate there twice.

"“highlight of our trip” I cant believe all the bad reviews this hotel has received! I stayed there for 3 days in september and it was one of the highlights of our vacation, all of these people writing complaining are so focused on the small rooms, but all the hotels in Manhatten are small unless you want to spend a fortune, and who goes to NYC to sit in your room. The whole point of NYC is to be out and about enjoying the enormous anount of activities then you go back to your hotel to change or sleep, and it was in the perfect location for that. I woke up and took a jog in central park, its right near the subway and its just uptown enough to be out of the real crazy busy area just downtown, which is fun of course but its nice to go back to your hotel and be just outside the madness yet still in a great location near the upper east side. Now to the hotel itself, its facade is so understated which is refreshing, it knows its good so it doestn have to boast by putting up a huge fake front, but when you go in and take the unassuming escalator up you are warmly greeted by such a nice foyer area, nice wood floors, cool lighting, chic, im so sick of these oversized marble pompous entryways of other hotels. The staff was so friendly, we were able to check in early, and why call the room small like ive read here, cozy would suit me better, my girlfriend and i were so excited to know that when we came back after a loud bright night in the city we would return to this charming, wood floored, wood walled(cozy)room, we slept so well in this space. The library room was very charming, nobody mentioned relaxing on a nice leather couch in front of the fireplace, we played a few games of pool on the billiards table, very relaxing, they had table with chess boards set up, books to read, come on people loosen up a bit and enjoy. The whole property is very modern and interesting, and yes a bit dark which is perfect for how the atmosphere of the place is, plenty of candles lit and many seating area to relax. Did anyone mention the bar of this place, the elevators open and the music hits you, wow this place is alive at night, classy but still fun, dancefloor always full and a generaly nice goodlooking crowd. I have to be truthfull and admit that the only downside of this hotel is some of the extra prices, if you want to get a good laugh look at the prices of roomservice, breakfast is a joke, i could not even imagine dinner prices, great comedy, but hey your in NYC so go eat out thats the whole point of going there, and let the someone else get ripped off at their food prices, but other than that it is truly a unique place.",aquamanfla,2006-09-01,223023,2006-09-25,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Small, but Great Property” I stayed at the Hudson for five nights, in part for a work function and staying on a few additional nights to run around NY and have fun. While the rooms are indeed tiny, most rooms in NY are small. There is a decent closet with good storage, and in general a place to put everything so you aren't tripping over your stuff. The bathroom is very tiny though and might be uncomfortable for tall or overweight people. Again, how much time do you really spend there?
The room was clean, and the staff at the hotel were incredibly accomodating. They do charge you a bundle for any extras though, so if you need a toothbrush or anything like that, run to the drug store across the street. Again, very common for NY. 
Great location, interesting people watching, and a gorgeous patio off the check-in area. While a scene at night, it's pretty empty during the day and is a good place to hang out and maybe even do some work (if you must).

The location is right by the park, midtown and several subway stops so its easy to get to and from no matter where you want to go. Negatives: The rooms are tiny. And I mean tiny. no chairs, dressers etc. barely room to walk around a double bed and that's it. That said, they are very clean, sleek and modern, had funky cool bedside lamps, wood panelling, etc. Bottom line, a great choice for a night or two where you don't plan to spend much time in hotel, for a longer stay would be severly cramped.

"“Loved the Hudson - would definitely return.” Booked the Hudson with Priceline for $115 for four nights over Labour Day weekend. After the quite poor reviews I read, I was a little worried. But for $115 I figured I couldn't go wrong. I wasn't disappointed.
Great location. Close to two metro stops. Two minutes from Central Park.
Some reviews mention a ""smell"" - - never experienced that. 
Lobby and common rooms quite impressive. 
Yes, room size is definitely small. But we had no problem hanging some clothing up, storing two carry-ons and one large suitcase in the room. TV is small but has lots of channels. 
Was never bothered by the ""noisy air conditioner"", the air worked very well and easily adjustable. The room was VERY CLEAN and housekeeping was done everyday, fresh towels etc. Bathroom was clean and yes, compact, but again, was not an issue.
Wasn't really able to make good use of the facilities (roof top patio, library, bar etc.) but they looked great and the garden courtyard was a very nice spot to relax. 
Didn't have to deal with the staff too much but when we did they were polite and helpful.

The rooms are neatly decorated and the hotel is modern and hip. The rooms are plenty big if you get an upgrade to two double beds, deluxe. Very nice bathrooms. 
The restaurant in the hotel was good and we saw a celebrity (well, sort of, the first winner of ""America's Top Model"" who now is married to ""Peter Brady."" ). Supposedly Paris Hilton was also staying there. 
The nightclub is fun and there is no cover for guests (at least on Thursday nights). Although the drinks were expensive, they were strong and well-made!
Also, the front desk staff was professional, friendly, and helpful. One member of our party was new to the city and did not want to walk around all afternoon. Even though checkout is noon, the hotel extended ours until 5 p.m. with a small fee. It really helped us out! 
The Sky Terrace (or whatever they called it- on the 15th floor) is also a nice amenity. A great place to relax and enjoy summer.
This hotel was well worth the money (via Priceline) and made our experience in the city enjoyable. Be careful, though, if you get a regular small room, they are quite small!

If I wanted a room with two double beds, it would be an extra $90 per night!! The hotel was not at all flexible on this, and Priceline says that a room with one double bed is suitable for two people.

"“very disappointed in the people and service” I was with a group of seven people staying as we were participating in the jewelry show at the Javits Center.
The rooms are very small, but nicely done. We had dinner in the 
hotel restaurant, the service was very slow and we had some problem with our orders and they were not very accomodating. We also order something from room service. After waiting about and hour, we gave up nothing came. 
Our group wanted to go to the bar and two of our group went there ahead to get one of the couches The people who went ahead were told that they could not hold the seating even though they advised the staff that there were seven of them staying at the hotel, so our group went to another hotel bar. 
THe head of our party was told when he booked the room that breakfast was included on Sunday. After our group ordered off the menu and ate breakfast (our breakfast was cheaper than the buffett) when he went to settle the bill they told him that we could not have breakfast off the regular menu it had to be the buffett. He was never told this by anyone, and our breakfast bill was cheaper. The girl at the desk was not very nice and we asked her several times she said she could not do anything. We then asked to see a manger, which the girl would never let us talk to she just went back and talked to her herself, and still said no to the breakfast. He had also been told that parking was included, however, because we were checking out at 10:00 we had to pay for parking for Sunday. We were an hour late to get the free parking, again he was never told about a parking deadline. 
This hotel is not cheap. He paid to have seven people stay there. I felt that the staff definitely had a NYC attitude, and really did not care about us the customer ever coming back.

"“Be careful of the 'mini-bar charge'!! Rip off!!” I stayed in Hudson Hotel in New york for one night in July. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, real masterpiece and definitively worth seeing. However, I had a very negative experience with the staff. Worst of all, I was charged for the 'mini bar', first $30.00, than after I went to complain, that was taken off with explanation that is was a charge that remained from the previous guest!!! Than, upon checking out another attempt was made to charge me, this time $21, again allegedly for the 'mini-bar'. When (again) I complained and I said that I did not used anything from there, the charge was taken off, again with explanation that it was from the previous guest!!!! Sure enough, even though I never signed or agreed to that charge, my credit card was charged again (got the statement yesterday). I am now disputing it through my credit card company and will keep you posted. I must say that I am a very frequent traveller and had stayed in many, many hotels all around the world and I never, ever had any problems of this nature even in hotels that were rated lower than this one.
There were other problems with the staff as well. First, on check in I was promised a room with a view (because, I was told many are available) but never actually got it. Than, I went down to try and get a coffee and was told to wait in the garden. After waiting for 1/2 hour, I got a terrible cappuccino and never got the mineral water that I ordered.",liljana,2006-07-01,223023,2006-08-13,False,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The service was great at the front and concierge desks. They were able to help me find just the dinner spot I was looking for. My room was clean and comfortable. 
I certainly agree that you don't need a huge hotel room in NY- you shouldn't be there that much. The bars at the Hudson were hopping. They were a little ""too cool for school"" for this gal. I was on the 6th floor of the hotel and didn't hear any noise during the night.
It was very convienent to the Time Warner Center which was where I was working, so that was an added benefit.

“Hudson experience good” Stayed at the Hudson in early August. The rooms are indeed tiny...but I had already been warned (thanks trip advisor). My wife and I thought the hotel was great. Very hip and interesting design. The employees were always super helpful and friendly. Great hang out area on the 15th floor...although drinks at 10 bucks a pop seems a bit much. Bed was probably the most comfortable I've ever slept on...and very quiet...maybe try for higher floors?

"“Dressing-up the bride: hip but not worth the hype” Nice entrance, bar and restaurant - plan on spending an evening in the hotel or at least take an after-dinner drink. 
Rooms are tiny. The renovation did not include the air conditioning. Mostly, walls were painted in dark colors or wooden panels were put in. I do not want to imagine how all the nice white accessories will look like after two years... 
Do not accept a room on the lower floors since they are quite noisy (air conditioners in front of your window).

Although the rooms were extremely small for two people (maybe perfect for one), we requested for a free upgarde to the next room class and got it. Common areas are very spacious. Check out their bar, library and their roof deck. Expect a very modern feel to the hotel.

"“Mixed Bag” This hotel is hard to rate simply, as it really has many positives & negatives. It depends on what you're looking for. Positives: the excellent location on W. 58th St. is 1 block from Colombus Circle @ Central Park. The hotel has a unique design throughout, including the trendy velvet roped bar that you have access to as a guest. It also has an indoor & outdoor restaurant which is very pleasant, a rooftop terrace (w/ a bar) for sunning is wonderful, lots of comfy chairs & couches placed around the ""library"" lounge (along w/ a pool table) & an outdoor patioThe staff is polite & helpful beyond belief. Here are the negatives: The rooms are the smallest ones I have ever seen & there are no drawers for any clothes, just hangers. Tiny(again uniquely designed)bathroom. My friend who has travelled all over the world (and who lives in NYC) visited & gasped that it was the smallest hotel room she'd ever seen. There was about 18 inches on each side of the queen bed. I got used to it & it really didn't bother me, except, if I went back, I would try to get this hotel on priceline & wouldn't pay over $125 for a room. I paid $169 as a special deal & would not pay it again. The other negative is the cost of everything & I do mean everything. They charge you for everything & charge a lot. Two drinks on the rooftop terrace (a gin & tonic & a glass of rose wine) was $25. However, I met 1 very happy repeat customer (a business traveler) who loved the place ""even though the martinis were $15,"" she told me. Now, it's not THE most expensive place in NY, but it's up there. The breakfast buffet was $27 & not bad, but you could certainly get cheaper. My pet peeve was that the ""assorted cheeses"" turned out to be 3 slices of white & yellow American cheese. Now, I know it's not France, but JEEZ, but for NYC & NYC prices, I expected at least gouda! All in all, I'd go again for a cheaper price & just not eat or drink there much, which is sad because the restaurant, bars & lounges are lovely.",chatnoir,2006-06-01,223023,2006-07-26,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

If I would have paid the $290-350 average price I would NOT have been a happy camper!

"“Disappointing stay in Hudson Hotel in New York” My wife and I stayed in Hudson Hotel New York between 10 - 17 July 06. We enjoyed New York but were not overly impressed with the hotel. The Hudson is more image than substance. If only it lived up to its tidy website. The library is for example stocked with 'painted books'. However our main complaint was with the size of the standard double room which was impractically and uncomfortably small and rather betrayed the hotels buildings YMCA origins, despite the tasteful makeover of public areas.

The Hudson is not that. It is a unique, stylish, and hip place. The rooms are small, but who cares. You're not going to spend that much time in there anyways. The decor is very modern and cool, and frankly, that's a big part of why I went there. The staff was very polite and surprisingly unpretentious. Overall I was very happy with the place.

"“Stay at the best western if....” Let me first warn you, if you are a traveler (not a tourist) and don't consider your hotel stay part of your vacation experience, then don't stay here...stay at the Best Western. If, however, you want to stay in a swanky, trendy hotel and don't plan to walk around in a ratty robe, and look forward to actually ""hanging out"" at your hotel where you can actually mingle with REAL New Yorkers, then this place is for you. Yes, this hotel is expensive... yes, the rooms are small (definitely ask for an upgrade), but in exchange, the staff is WONDERFUL. Daniel (front desk) and Mark (bell staff) treated us like friends and not sources of income...refreshing.

By the way, if you are going to New York city and don't know that it is expensive, then go to someplace like Missouri or Arkansas and go to Times Square with the rest of the tourists.

"“What a disaster!” I stayed here on business, and was astounded by the poor quality of the service and facilities. The only thing this place had going for it was the location.
I sent a letter to the hotel detailing my complaints (via email & USPS) and to date have received no reply. Below is a detailed description of my experience. I would just add that my fellow business colleagues staying in the same hotel were equally appalled and we all have no plans to ever return.
1.On the evening of the first night of my stay, I invited a few friends to my room. In person, I asked the concierge to arrange for six glasses to be brought to the room. When the glasses had not arrived 30 minutes later, and a call to room-service had gone unanswered, I went back down to the reception desk. The receptionist said the concierge had left for the evening but that he would take care of the matter himself. Twenty more minutes passed and still no glasses arrived so I again went to the same person at the reception desk to inquire. This person’s reaction was to inform me that he had already called housekeeping to ask for the glasses (rather than, say, apologizing for the delay and working to rectify the matter). When I told him that despite his call no glasses had arrived, so perhaps he should do something further, he promised to call again. When the glasses had not arrived 20 minutes later (yes, this is now over an hour after my first request), I went to the library bar and fetched some glasses myself. The glasses from housekeeping never arrived. 
2.Later the same night, a security guard knocked on the door and informed me of “numerous noise complaints” related to my gathering. In a rather aggressive manner—and prior to giving me a chance to respond—he proceeded to outline the dire consequences should the noise level not go down. First, I pity those who had to launch “numerous complaints” before I was informed of the problem—from their point of view, that can not seem to have been responsive. Second, I had no intention of disturbing anyone and indeed there was no threatened second visit (although, given the apparent dysfunction of the hotel, that may have been for other reasons!).
3.Neither our guests that night, nor I, were particularly impressed with the interior of the room where, for example, the floorboards were literally coming apart at the seams and some were even lifted from the floor. The shelves in the bathroom were coming out of the wall and had to be pushed back in, and in addition the room fan was quite loud. 
4.I had two computers, one personal and one for business, so I called the desk to ask if the charge for Internet service was per room or per computer and were told it was per room. The next day when I needed to use the two computers, I found this information was incorrect. The receptionist said she would put a note in our account such that we would only be charged once for that day. Despite this promise, upon checkout there were two charges which I then had to spend time at the front desk correcting.
5.Upon checkout, I arranged for late departure for my husband who was travelling with me. Despite this, and in contravention to a “do not disturb” sign, someone knocked on the door at around 10 am and kept at it until it was answered. When my husband pointed out that late departure had been arranged, that regular checkout time had not come, and there was a no disturbance request on the door, the woman who knocked responded that guests sometimes forgot to remove the sign upon leaving. It did not seem to dawn on the person that an apology was in order. 
6.On the day I arrived I left a message for a colleague with the concierge. She verified that the guest was in the hotel, and took the written message (in an envelope with his name on the front) from me. My colleague received this message upon checkout 2 days later! This is simply unacceptable.
7.It seemed sadly consistent with my experience at the hotel that the vending machines on my floor were out of order when I arrived and remained so for the duration of my stay.
In sum, the hotel seems to be in a state of disrepair with little communication between the employees and even less commitment to making guests feel comfortable. Both as a business traveler and as a frequent traveler, I know that I will not stay at that hotel again or recommend it to anyone else or to others at my company.",atteoj,2006-03-01,223023,2006-07-10,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“A night at the Hudson Hotel in NYC” My husband and I stayed one Saturday night at the Hudson and thought it was terrific! Although we were upgraded from a regular room to a superior room (20 square feet larger), our room was quite small, but absolutely beautiful! The bed linens were fabulous! 
The people working in the hotel couldn't have been nicer.
When we got to our room close to 1 am, the lobby was flooded with people and there was loud music playing in the bar. Yet, in our room on the 4th floor, we couldn't hear a thing. 
We found out about the hotel from Travel Zoo. We paid $169 + taxes, which is $100 less than the usual rate. We met 2 other guests who said they paid $100 for the night from Priceline, but if they stayed more than the one Saturday night, the rate would have gone up substantially.

"“A Bad Acid Trip” The decorators must have been on a bad acid trip when they did the interior design of this hotel. It is trendy to the point of bizarre. I suppose the hotel appeals to a certain demographic---and I am not it. 
As reported in other reviews, the rooms are tiny. You would not want to be in the room with anyone else, unless you are extremely intimate with them. 
My non-smoking room smelled of smoke. I did not have much interaction with the staff, but they seemed pleasant to the extent I did interact with them.

“Pleasantly Suprised” I stayed at the Hudson Hotel apprehensively after reading posting from other travelers. I was pleasantly surprised. The room was incredible clean with wood floors. While the room was small I did not find it uncomfortable. In fact I thought the size and the layout were out of the ordinary and quite frankly it was a great change from the same old room set up.

"“Unique, positive experience” Just returned from a one night stay at the Hudson. I won this nights stay on a popular auction site for $125 (the Hudson is very frequently available on that site for around that price). When I saw that my bid had won the Hudon--I was very dissapointed and dreading staying there because of all the negative reviews on this and other sites and the fact that I am very particular.
I found the hotel to be clean, unique and very, very well located. The rooms were inventively laid out and quiet(small-but I've had smaller!) At the above referenced price it was also a tremendous bargain. The staff was young,attractive, and friendly and helpful.
If you are going to be spending a lot of time in your room or can't bear the thought of not having a drawer to stash your socks and undies--you probably shouldn't stay here. Otherwise it's a great place!
FYI- I'm 55 and from the Midwest- a stereotypical ""Jethro"". While I didn't attempt to ""hang"" with the beautiful people, neither did I feel ""offput"" or out of place at any time. Many of the patrons seemed similar to my circumstance.
There are many reviews dating back to 2002 on this site (and other review sites) that accurately describe the size of the rooms and the somewhat dark overall motif.

we were greeted by friendly staff and given our room keycard and pass to bar / club - we didnt use the bar / club, there are so many other places to go,, and whenever we passed by it we knew the place wasn't our sort of thing..we had a queen room with air con.. window that opened.. shower and bath and yes its small but its a bathroom!!.. our bed was totally comfy and was made up for us each day.. yes the room is fairly small but it is a bedroom!!.. a hotel is a hotel is a hotel.. its a place to rest your head and wash away the day..come on..its a hotel!!!....... we had a great stay, no problems, flame diner over the road is open 24/7 go over there and eat or get take out and eat in your room.. the mini-bar is pricey.. but whooooo uses one in any hotel they are always pricey!!...the staff, yes some of them are wannabees but do i really care...NO..im happy in my world!!

"“Location is fine - rooms are VERY small” Just returned (today) from a weekend stay in the Hudson Hotel. The rack prices (~$299) are too high for this hotel, but it was fine for the $115/day price I received on Priceline. The hotel is located in Columbus Circle just southwest of Central Park so the location is excellent. Easy walking distance to the theater district, Times Square, Rockefeller, etc. The biggest complaint would be the room size. There was barely enough room for the queen size bed. The bathroom on the cruise I recently took was actually the same size of that in the Hudson Hotel. The total square footage of a room for 2 is ~120 square feet. This is smaller then you might think!!! This hotel is very trendy with lots of locals hanging out at the very ""modern"" bars.

“Disaster” I stayed at the Hudson in June 2006 and really hated it. The Hotel common spaces are beautiful to look at but that is really where the positives end. The rooms are amazingly small and noisy - the service is non-existent - and there are absolutely NO creature comforts to be found at this place.

"“Everything was tiny, except the price” I have no idea why this hotel gets any business at all. It is self-consciously hip, all flash and no function. I paid (or should I say, fortunately, my company paid) $389 per night for a tiny, tiny room. The desk clerk claimed to have upgraded me, but if so, I can only offer my sympathy to anyone who did not get upgraded. 
The room had a tiny table, mostly filled by two bottles of absurdly expensive water (priced at about $24 a gallon) and a sealed music CD, also for sale at an inflated price. The tiny shelves in the corner held a CD player, a 13"" TV, a mini-bar, a basket of more things to buy, and a digital safe. There was no DVD player in the room, in spite of what the fact sheet on the Web site says.The room had price tags on some items (e.g. the iron), and a price sheet for just about every item in there, plus some that were not actually there, such as an umbrella, a basic courtesy in other NY hotels.
There was a nice bed, but no reading light (apparently it would have interfered with the artistic mood lighting). No drawers for clothes storage, although there were about ten high-quality hangers in the ""closet."" With some judicious rearrangement, I was able to clear off one shelf under the mini-bar so I had someplace to put my socks.
The bathroom was just as bad as others here have described. Its cramped design definitely would have violated building codes here in Los Angeles, but perhaps the rules are more lax in NY. And somehow the advantage of being able to sit on the bed, see through the shower, and view the toilet was missed on me.

The huge Garden Terrace is beautiful, comfy, and you can read the Times without being hassled by waiters to order a cocktail or lunch. And the sky terrace is off the freakin' hook!

"“Stay Away!” I've stayed at this hotel a few times accidentally (ended up with it through Priceline), and last weekend was the worst. I will not stay there again. 
The rooms are tiny. Like one person said, there's a queen bed, and there's maybe two feet around all sides. I've only stayed for one night at a time; I have no idea how anyone could fit actual luggage in there. The rooms are even smaller than in budget hotels in Europe, which are notoriously tiny. The bathroom door wouldn't open all the way, because it hit the sink, and to sit on the toilet, I had to have my legs sprawled wide open to keep my knees from mashing painfully into the wall (I'm tall, but I'm not THAT tall). There are no bathtubs, either, just slightly-larger-than-normal shower stalls. I don't care if Philippe Starck PERSONALLY painted the walls; this hotel is NOT worth the price.
On my most recent stay I decided I wanted a more energetic scene than the Library bar (where an imported beer is $10, but at least the pool table is free). So I went to the Hudson bar. They wouldn't let me in. The guy at the door, and then the bar manager, claimed that it was because of my shoes. The manager called my Birkenstocks -- not even the slip-on kind, but the kind with the ankle straps -- ""flip-flops,"" and claimed that if there was broken glass they didn't want me to get hurt. Yet there were tons of girls in there in flimsy little Manolo-type shoes with a sole the thickness of a sheet of paper. The real reason they didn't want me in, I believe, is because I'm not one of the anorexic blond ""beautiful people"" they want everyone to think goes there. Perhaps if I had walked in off the street this selectivity might be understandable, but I was a guest of the hotel! To not let me in its bar is UNACCEPTABLE. And everyone had such a snotty attitude. 
As a postscript, I snuck in the bar anyway. And it was lame. All that attitude for ... not much of anything. After the way they treated me, if I ""accidentally"" got a room here through Priceline, I'd pay for another room in a different hotel for the same night, to avoid staying here.",LeMonde,2006-05-01,223023,2006-05-23,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Too Small and Bad Practices” The lobby and bar are the only benefits to staying at this hotel. The rooms are too small for any reasonable size adult person and the service is marginal. But beware of questionable practices…the hotel group that owns the Hudson initially authorizes your credit card for four times the room rate and then takes their time correcting the charges.

"“Thoughts on the Hudson...” We got a good deal on this hotel $199 for a junior suite - I got this rate through my work.
When we arrived the front desk said that as the hotel was so busy our upgraded room wasnt ready until the following night. We were fine with this. Thank god we moved rooms because the standard rooms are SMALL! Tiny TV, tiny bathroom. I would not have paid to stay in a room that size. However the hotel was magnificent, the lobby was grand and the staff VERY helpful and sweet. We didnt drink in the bar or eat in the restaurant but we did get some complimentary english breakfast tea when we asked one morning. Room service is EXPENSIVE as with all hotels and food delivered to the room isnt as hot or delicious as you would think or expect.

"“Very trendy at a price!!” We stayed there on our honeymoon; we wanted something a bit different and contemporary and we thought that this Philip Starck hotel was the perfect place!
Location was a plus as it was near Central Park. As soon as you arrive the lobby is very impressive but everything it's a bit too dark even on a sunny day it doesn't seem to get much light inside...the lobby was constantly busy with people coming and going not matter what time of the day was- one of the busiest hotels i've ever been to. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The rooms are small and i can imagine that if you live in a big house/apartment you will feel claustrophobic inside- My husband and I live in a very small apartment in London and we are quite petite so it was nice and cosy enough for us. We never had any food at the hotel cause it was very expensive but we decided to have some drinks on a saturday evening ...in the main bar we were sat in the middle and we were asked to move because they had to leave those tables for those who wanted to buy champagne or be prepared to spend a min of $300...we left straight away but we thought it was quite rude to do so, specially when were guests at the Hotel. We moved to the Library Bar which i think it's much nicer- the other bar is more for people to look and be looked at and you feel too overexposed! At the Libray bar we had 6 cocktails in total at $22 each one plus tips- iI think we must have spent around £120 or more throughout the evening- we never went back although the experience was good. In general we would recommend this hotel as a one off experience if you like trendy boutique types but i think for that price you could find something with a better balance of all you want whilst you stay in a hotel. New York is so amazing that the Hotel was never a concern- great food at Flame- diner opposite the hotel, huge breakfasts.

"“pea sized rooms and staff with pea sized brains to match” I stayed at the Hudson for two weeks for work at the end of October and beginning of November in 2004. In two weeks anyone is sure to have their share of bumps along the way, but this hotel experience was absolutely horrific.
First of all, the rooms are tiny. The one I was in pretty much fit a queen size bed with about a foot of walking space around it and then about 5 feet from the end of the bed to the two doors that led to the bathroom (also miniscule) and a walk in closet. Now someone should explain to me why they wasted so much room on a walk in closet when the bathroom was so small I couldn't even blow dry my hair.
Now, the insanely small size of the room explains why there was no sort of refrigeration device in the room, however, I take medication that requires refrigeration. So I asked for a refrigerator to be brought up to the room. 
The front desk informaed me that I would be charged $20/day for the refrigerator, which over 2 weeks adds up to almost $300. I asked to speak to a manager at which point the gave me an assistant manager who told me the same thing. Once I had finally spoken to the manager, he approved my fridge for no charge.
About half way through my trip, I got food poisoning (from their restaurant no less) and ended up in the emergency room until 5 am. When I got back to the hotel all I wanted to do was sleep so I put the do not disturb sign on my room. Well, they were renovating the floor right above me and ripping out carpet. On top of that housekeeping knocked on my door (despite the do not disturb sign) not once, not twice, but five times throughout that day. When I didn't answer any of those times, the front desk called my room. At which point I lost it. 
Management comped me the room rate for that day but offered no apologies for anything. I am NEVER going back.
The hotel and the people may be beautiful but they are complete morons with no idea what service actually means.

"“Great- not perfect, but great!” My sister and I stayed here in April 2006- the hotel is beautifully designed and the staff is efficient and courteous. There was some weird sulphurous smell in the front lobby to the street, the escalators and elevators, but it never seemed to make it to the room. The room and bathroom are beautiful but microscopic. It wasn't a problem because who goes to NYC to spend all day in the hotel? Might be awkward if you're staying with someone other than a VERY close friend, sibling, partner, etc- just because maneuvering is difficult in such an enclosed space. The AC worked great, but if your'e a smoker, be warned- there's little air ventilation/circulation (no fan) so if you try to smoke in your room, it just hangs in the air like a cloud. 
Still, it's a great deal for the price (which would be high for anywhere else, but for midtown manhattan, is very reasonable.)

"“Dont do it!” Stayed at the Hudson in Sept 2004 for a birthday treat and must admit was very, very dissapointed! It was expensive and just not worth it at all and I have stayed in some expensive places. As soon as we arrived the staff were very unhelpful and when we were shown to our room we couldnt believe how small it was. It was soo tiny, I would recommed only one person to stay in this room, there is no room for suitcase and after 6 days of shopping hard it was hard to breathe in the place!

"“Disappointing” We had been looking forward to spending New Year in New York for months and particularly chose the Hudson as we knew it had a good bar.
Although the communal areas are undeniably impressive, I think we would've been better off just visiting them and staying somewhere else. 
Our bedrooms were extremely small, not even big enough to get a full length view of your elf in a mirror (as you can't move far enough back without bumping into some furniture!) and not enough storage space. Also, for our whole 5 night stay our toilet was constantly flushing, despite us mentioning it to staff on many occasions.
The piece de resistance though was New Year's Eve. We had intended to at least have a few drinks in the Hudson Bar, if not bring in New Year in there, however we were disgusted to find out that there was to be a private party in ALL of the communal areas. The cost to get into this party was going to be over £180 for both of us. We could not believe that the Hudson did not even have one bar area for their paying guests. 
On the night itself, guests were made to feel most unwelcome and they even had bouncers checking your keys at the lifts. You really felt as though you should not be there.
Incidentally, we spent NYE at the W Hotel on Lexington Avenue, a hotel we had stayed in on our previous trip to NYC. THe W charged $10 entrance fee, which included access to their separate bar and their large hotel bar. The atmosphere was great and at midnight they came round and gave everyone a free glass of champagne, irrespective of whether you were staying there or not. The difference between the 2 hotels could really not have been greater and, unlike the Hudson, W were definitely not trying to rip you off.

"“Swish and Stylish” My partner and I stayed at the Hudson in late March for four nights. 
Upon arriving quite late, 11pm (without luggage that AA lost), we were advised by the check-in staff that only a single room was available for the night. But was offerred a free breakfast for our trouble and promised an upgrade for the remainder of our stay. After travelling directly from Melb, Australia to NYC, it doesn't matter how small the room is, all we were after was a clean bathroom and a comfortable and clean bed. The Hudson delivered.
Our initial upgraded suite was great, but had a consistant banging noise coming from the roof. We contacted reception, who were more than happy to change our room. 
The Hudson is a fantastic hotel, with a fabulous bar and library. We found the hotel staff really accommodating and friendly. The front desk staff and bell boys were always accommodating to our requests and ultra courtieous and professional.
The bar is awsome to have a drink and chill out to the sounds. If your hungry, I recommend the Flame diner on the corner, across from the Hudson - it was 24 hours and was perfect for the late night snack and breakfast.

I was also there Easter weekend and did not smell any horrible odors. The air conditiong was certainly not powerful but then again, the outside temperature did not require much. The room size was hilarious and sharing it with another person was dauntingly funny. I found the service to be perfectly fine, some incredibly helpful and others clueless but they're all in black and downright good looking. The library bar is elegant and tons of fun. The outdoor patio is hyperbolically hip with guests from around the world striking poses and throwing out euro attitude that is truly a joy to watch. 
 My hot water spewed out within seconds, the sheets were crisp yet soft, the view was nice, and the whole experience a lot of fun. To whom would I recommend the hotel?

"“Not bad, BUT.” I am determined to be upbeat here but one cannot deny the deficiencies of this hotel. Yes the rooms are very small and we knew this as we'd stayed before in 2002. What we didn't know was that a ""superior"" queen room was barely bigger than a standard. Still, as some of the other reviewers have said this is a boutique hotel and you don't go to NY to spend hours in your hotel room.That said, the rooms are not intelligently designed and space is wasted. The air-con is indeed noisy, it wasn't a massive problem to us but light sleepers beware! 
On to the public spaces. Very impressive, but remember you don't need to be staying at the hotel to enjoy them and you may feel as a guest that you are largely paying to maintain these spaces for the benefit of all. 
The cashing of travellers cheques seems to be a real issue for the Hudson. We found they were unwilling to deal with more than $200 at any time. Even worse, at 7.45pm on the Saturday night of our stay we were told they had no facility to cash us $100. We actually had to complain and make a nuisance of ourselves in order to make it happen and it eventually did happen. This tells me that it wasn't a case of ""can't"", it was a case of ""can't be bothered"". This is a standard hotel service the world over, you shouldn't be forced to demand it. I don't blame the reception staff for this as it appeared to be a management failing (or possibly hotel policy?).

"“Hurray for the Hudson” While I understand that everyone has a different experience, I just don't understand the one-star reviews of the Hudson. One-star?? The place has style coming out of its orifices, from the bronze-cast elevator walls to the sumptuously ivied lobby, and this diversion from typical chintzy hotel decor alone earns it a couple of pips as far as I am concerned.
But the Hudson is better than that. People complain about the size of the rooms. Why? When we booked online we were told that our room was 150 sq. ft. (that's a standard room with queen size bed, a few dollars a night more expensive than the smallest option, 144 sq. ft.). That's 15 ft x 10 ft, which is plenty big, and we used our room a lot during our stay without ever feeling crushed or crowded. Indeed, the room was an archetype of excellent design, by which I don't just mean the stylish details (though they were nice) but also the ability to make the most of the space. Four bedside tables, a writing desk and chair, open clothes hanger and shelf behind the dividing curtain you see in my photos (the ensuite is back there too), and a concealed cupboard with safe, mini-bar, shelves for personal items, TV and stereo seem an almost miraculous achievement.
The staff were helpful and friendly with only a couple of exceptions - on our last morning, the housekeeper knocked on our door twice to ask us if we had checked out yet, which felt like pressure on us to get moving before the allowed time, and the desk clerk on checkout seemed less than pleased by our desire to split payment of the account between cash and cards. But these were minor matters: otherwise everyone was wonderfully polite, friendly and helpful. On arrival, the doorman had our cases out of the trunk almost before we were out of the cab, and when we left for the evening, they had a cab with us instantly; room service were wonderful on the phone and in person, and the desk staff were helpful with directions and local advice. And if much of this charm was brought on by the desire for a tip, then that doesn't set them apart from any other service professionals in New York. And if it's a deal-maker, you may be pleased to know also that the staff, male and female, seem exclusively recruited from the ranks of retired Abercrombie and Fitch models.
Our one major disappointment with the Hudson was that the much-vaunted Sky Terrace on the 15th floor is currently closed for renovations. This isn't mentioned on the website or in their room welcome pack, and indeed I see the tripadvisor pic for the Hudson shows the terrace: so don't get your hopes up. This was disappointing particularly because the hotel otherwise is such an all-encompassing experience - from the luxurious library with pool table, through the private park on the second floor to the ultra-hip bar where the beautiful people gather each night - that we found ourselves using the hotel as much more than just a crash-pad at night.
All in all, the Hudson is a superb choice for young(ish) visitors who like a bit of style where they're staying. Its location adjacent to Central Park is superb, and if you don't fancy paying for room service, there's a Starbucks on W 58th Street (turn right out of the hotel entrance), and a wonderful Whole Foods Market in the basement of the Time Warner Centre at the end of the street. Having said that, the room service food is better than any I have tasted, and the 'Cafeteria' restaurant within the hotel is pricey but superb.",JohnSelf,2006-04-01,223023,2006-04-20,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“The Hudson ain't no HoJo” So, if you expect HoJo - go to one! Spent Easter weekend at the Hudson with my best friend for my first visit to NYC. For us, it was IDEAL. Clean, friendly, prompt staff, modern and funky. 
Our room was impeccable and yes, SMALL. But all we needed at the end of the day was a place to crash. I've read some complaining about the in-room snacks, etc. There is a CVS drugstore across the street and a WHOLE FOODS in the Time Warner bldg across the street as well...easy to get your own room snacks. We never ate there with so much nearby. Just a couple of martinis in the bar ($14 each).
As far as the soundproofing goes - the a/c unit actually acted as white noise (and was not clunky as some ppl have mentioned)
and we slept just fine. No issues with hot water. it was always there.
The bathroom is tiny (I really do agree with ppl who said it would be difficult to use if you were tall and/or very obese) and there is a glass partion (which u can seal off visually w/ the shower curtain) btwn the bathroom and bed. But - it's white, so you can still see vague shadows, if you're squishy about those kinda things.
The smell everyone keeps talking about? YES. It exists. On one of the lower floors (not room floors...a reception hall area or something that is not high-traffic or used by guests). Our elevator opened on this floor accidentally and we got a big ol' whiff of sewer. Mm mm good. Fortunately, it wasn't in our room or the lobby or anywhere else. Just be forewarned: there is a sewer floor. hah!
The bar is fun (80s/90s music) and a hangout for local New Yorkers as well. So, if you're looking for nightlife...it's downstairs!
We actually got our room for $50/night due to a system error on their website. So, we had 3 nights in NYC for $180 total cuz someone on the website screwed up. Maybe if we had paid regular fare, we wouldn't be so forgiving. STILL...what we needed was there.
This place is not for kids and not for middle age, quiet types who want in-room snacks and a big ol' TV. You're in New York! Plenty is at your fingertips. It's small, clean, modern facility. The staff are accomodating, the location is outstanding.

"“Just OK” Stayed for two nights. Would definitely not stay any longer. Yes the rooms are TINY (cruise ship tiny) and this hotel is way overpriced. Had I not needed to stay in that part of the city, I would have left. Most of the employees are friendly and room service coffee was right on time. But why isn't there a coffee maker in the $300-a-night room? They pride themselves on being so trendy but I'm sure I can do better next time.

"“Tiny roomes even by Manhattan standards” This hotel while admittedly stylish has some of the smallest rooms this side of a Japanese cube hotel.
Despite the high price, there are no luxuries that live up to the appearance, bottled water in your room is 6.50. No tea or coffe makers. Bathrooms are similar size to airplane toilets. Overpriced breakfasts ($27) are the same old buffet crap - so much for the fusion restaurant.
For those who think that this is to be expected as it is New York, no - its not. There are many hotels in this price range (when booked online) that offer much better facilities and you wont get nickel and dimed to the same extent. You will be hard pushed to find smaller rooms except at perhaps another Morgan group hotel.
The bar is very overhyped - $18 for a glass of mediocre wine and overall it tries to hard to declare its trendiness. 
There is a second more relaxing bar with a pool table which seemed interesting but was closed off for a private party.

"“1 person per room is a must-” I can't say I had the best experience here but it was not horrid. 
It is a one person room (or two people only if happily dating or married). Put another way, if you are going to stay there with someone make damn sure that you are okay with them seeing you in all kinds of awkward positions. 
The rooms are very small. 
My room had a window from the bathroom into the rest of the room. Yes it had a curtain but it wasn't a thick one. So you see why I say make sure you are either alone or staying with someone you are very comfortable with. There is about 1 foot and a half of space between the double bed and the walls. 
The hotel is darkly lit, that is true, and the 12 inch tvs are weird. The in hotel restaurant was overpriced, but the food was decent, I'd skip it and venture out the next time.

"“Fun and trendy but poor lighting” I stayed at the hotel for one night on business and thought it was good but not fabulous. In an effort to be hip and trendy the hotel's decorators decided to go for minimalist lighting. This is less than ideal when you are applying makeup, reading, or walking down a darkly painted and dimly lit hallway late at night in the big city- I did not feel totally safe. The rooms are tiny, which is fine for one night in NYC but would not recommend for an extended stay. There was an odd odor to the hotel, almost damp and dirty, yet it looked and seemed clean. Perhaps strangely scented cleaning products? 
The good news was the staff was friendly and helpful. And for people in their 20's and early 30's the hotel is very trendy and fun.

"“Loved the Hudson” We stayed at the Hudson for our first wedding anniversary, and once we told the staff they were really willing to accomodate us. They gave us a free upgrade, got us reservations at Tao and gave us great reccomendations. But I am sure they would be willing to do that for anyone for any occasion. The rooms are quite small but we didnt spend much time in them since there is so many other things to do in NYC! Would not reccomend to someone who is not into the trendy or modern since this hotel is all of that. If you are looking for traditional rooms and service do not stay here. They had a great bar in the lobby that apparently is hard to get into but as a guest you get ""no wait"" privelages.

"“Better than these reviews state!” After reading many, many reviews of the Hudson NY, I was very leery about our upcoming stay there. I went on many sites to find out all I could. I can honestly tell you that our 4 night stay was marvelous! OK, we knew the rooms were small, and they are. We stayed in a standard queen. But it really is enough space unless you have more than 2 and you do aerobics in your room every day. There is a closet and a desk and a locker style cabinet with shelves that holds the 12"" TV. The decor was beautiful, the room was clean, room service was extremely prompt, no matter what time of day we called (late at night or early in the a.m.) the staff was friendly and accomodating, the concierge was most helpful every time we asked a question (which was often) and the location is great. One thing that has been mentioned is that the heater is noisy and that is true. However, we were so tired every night that we fell right asleep and it didn't bother us. There is a Johns Pizza down the block that has great pizza by the slice and the Flame restaurant across the street that has a full menu (check it out online). Columbus circle is right there so you can catch a subway train anywhere and the southwest entrance to Central Park is one block away. The only thing we were charged for that we didn't use was the business center because I used my room key to enter but did not go in and apparently, upon doing that, it charges your credit card $15. There is also free coffee in the cafeteria each morning. We did not eat breakfast there because it is way too expensive and we don't like to eat that much for breakfast. A short subway ride up the west side takes you to H&H bagels though. The doormen are wonderful, and the staff in the uber trendy Hudson bar is also nice.

"“Loved the Design!!” I have just returned from 6 nights at the Hudson with my Girlfriend and to be honest i read all the reviews AFTER i booked it, and i was shocked to see so many complaints. I contacted the travel agent, but they would not change us to another hotel unless we lost a lot of money so i decided to stick with it and hope for the best. Anyway, six weeks later we arrived at the Hudson and i was so worried to say the least as we pulled up to the green glass doors. But upon arrival, up the esclators with the green neon lights was a different type of hotel that i had never ever experienced. It was trendy, clean and Different to the modern usual one you would expect to go to so this made our trip to NYC even better.
Yes the rooms were a little tiny to that of others i have seen in brochures, but they were ample size for what you need. You dont go to NYC to stay in your room now do you!! People say they couldnt swing a cat around? What are they talking about, swinging tigers??!!! 
Yes you can see the bathroom through a large pane of glass from the bedroom, but you have net curtain and also a shower curtain that you can pull across, so you still get your privacy which acts like a normal wall so what are people going on about? Privacy is there if you want it guyz!!
We had a working heater, working lights, trendy light fittings, a comfy bed to die for and lovely clean white linen! 
HONESTLY this hotel is the ideal place to come to, to see how it differs to the boring modern place.

The rooms where very small, but they where clean. Although the heating is very noisy and it kept breaking down!
The bathroom was very clean although the shower kept going cold and we did have a slight toilet leak!!.
I did not think much of the reception service they were quite rude at times and they took 30 minutes to cash $200 dollar traveller cheque. and I felt that they wasn't well organised all they seemed to care about is paying for stuff!!

The room's floors were buckling, the thermostat didn't work and made the room too hot, the towels frayed and the shower flooded the bathroom b/c the curtain is an inch too short (how could they overlook that?). Also they forgot to pick up the breakfast door tag off our door. The caliber of the room is that of a much lower price range than what they're charging.

"“Third time not a charm” This was my third stay at the Hudson in three years and although the service was excellent as usual, I think the rooms are showing considerable wear and tear. We reserved a superior queen room, but found it to be hardly larger than a standard room. I'm not sure if there was recent water damage in the room, but the wood floor was severely buckling in a number of spots. It was so bad that as you walked from the bed to the bathroom, the floor creaked and popped beneath your feet. All of the grout on the tile floor in the bathroom was discolored and yellow. When you use the shower, the curtain is either too short or the tile lip is not tall enough so water floods onto the floor leaving it soaking wet. The blinds on the windows were bent and broken and they didn't close completely. Some of these are minor issues but they all add up to a feeling that you aren't getting what you pay for at the Hudson.

"“Outstanding Hotel. Don't judge it by some of these bad reviews.” I'm always so surprised at how many people have such a terrible opinion of the Hudson. The week before last was my second stay at this hotel and will not be my last. I actually work in the hotel industry and I have got to say that I have rarely encountered service that was this exceptional. 
Upon arriving at the hotel, I realized that I had left my laptop case (inside was my laptop, day planner, schedule, wallet and credit cards) in the taxi. In about three seconds, a routine business trip turned into a nightmare. 
I went to the front desk to check in and, of course, was in quite a bind since I had no credit cards with me and only about $200 in cash. 
Chelsea, the front desk agent, felt the wrath of my stress and frustration when I, admittedly, was quite rude and unfriendly. She responded to my bad attitude with understanding, politeness and a genuinely helpful demeanor. She then introduced me to her manager, Don Cheatham. Don, like Chelsea, was an unbelievable help. They were able to get me checked in without the card, and suggested that the concierge might be able to help get my laptop case back by calling the number on the receipt for the cab. This was how I met the head concierge who's name, I think, was James. 
From, calling the cab company and tracking down my case (which was returned to me that night without a thing missing) to, then helping me find an obscure power cord for my computer by calling several places, to showing me how to get from Midtown to Kennedy in 40 minutes at Rush Hour for $7.... the head concierge is one of the most resourceful and pleasant concierge I have ever encountered.
The night of my check-in fiasco, after I had gotten settled in, I got a knock at the door and was blown away when I answered the door to see a bottle of wine and a handwritted card being delivered to me with regrets that my trip had started off badly and wishes for a pleasant stay. 
Thanks, in large part to the Hudson staff, the rest of my trip was great. 
I can't understand how so many people can complain about the level of service at this hotel. 
Some of the other common complaints, are somewhat valid. The rooms are very small and the hallways are dark. But, this hotel is not for everyone. The design of the hotel and the bar scene in the lobby is young, hip and very image-conscious. If you are a 20 or 30 something, urbane professional who enjoys places filled with beautiful people and cool design and are willing to look past the overpriced drinks and occasional phony to embrace the scene, then you'll love the Hudson.

"“Terrible Hotel” I stayed at the Hudson Hotel in December, 2004, along with several co workers. It was dark, gloomy, and dreadful. Plumbing problems, too--lack of hot water!

"“Smells like a sewer” I have stayed at Hudson several times in the past. Service is not the best, but the rooms decent. How much more can you ask from a hotel in NY that charges under $200 a night?
I visited Hudson Feb 8-10 2006. The new problem is when you walk into the hotel, you are hit with a powerful and awful smell. Cross between an open sewer and lemon pledge. It will make you gag.
I asked the doorman about smell - he said ' you know, people ask me that all the time, but I guess I'm just used to it now'. I sent an e-mail (no response) and called the hotel to ask if they were addressing the issue. They are not.

"“Lots of hype, lots of money” I wanted to spend the first New Year's eve with my new husband in New York; it had always been a dream of mine to do the Times Square thing in person. The Husdon hotel promised a funky, trendy atmosphere to fit our urban lifestyle, so we thought it was a perfect fit. Until we arrived. Yes, the entrance and lobby is impressive as is the lounge. Sipping martinis at the bar with the trendy 20-something crowd around us dressed in Gucci and Prada from head to toe was something reminiscent of a Sex and the City episode. The food at the Cafeteria was great although the service wasn't. We arrived on New Year's Eve and for a mere $500.00 US per night, we were stashed in a room with barely enough space to fit the two of us and our 3 pieces of luggage. The scent of bleach was disturbingly overwhelming, although that could be interpreted as a reassuring sign of cleanliness. After settling in, we discovered deficiencies in the room that costed us the night's sleep. I brought the issue (a malfunctioning and very noisy heater and nonfunctioning lights) to the attention of a doding front desk employee the next morning who prompty directed us to another room at a marginally cheaper rate. Gladly, we accepted the alternative except the room we were moved to was smaller (if you can imagine that) with a bubbling wood floor, risking our balance and splinters everytime we moved about the room. We had also been promised champagne and strawberries in the first room as part of an upgrade by a member of the staff as well as an American Express customer service representative who confirmed the arrangement but these never arrived either. When we finally checked out and brought up the issues again, the front desk clerk basically said in no uncertain terms that I should temper my expectations for a hotel that has been retrofitted to a one hundred and something year old YMCA building. They simply thanked us for our business and welcomed us back very soon. I paid the bill but would never stay there again nor recommend it to anyone. Not only did we pay an excuberant sum of money - some 25% more than market value because of the holidays - for less than mediocre accommodations but the hotel did not deliver on any of its promises nor did it offer any conclusive and reasonable solutions.

"“Great boutique hotel, excellent service and a stellar location” It's important to remember that this is a boutique hotel. If you're expecting a mass-market chain size hotel room, you'll be disapointed. However, if you're looking for a quirky, thoughtfull and beautifully designed hotel, don't look any further. 
The service was at a much more personal level than most hotels I've stayed in. The front desk staff was especially welcoming and chatty. An issue with my room key at check-in was quickly fixed, and on top of the genuine and profuse appologies from the staff, they upgraded my room with no prompting. That's real service in my book.
The rooms, while small, are spacious enough for two guests. Large mirrors, lighting and a window into the shower/bathroom make the room apear much larger. There are also great Philipe Starck touches throughout the hotel.
My favorite space is the sun deck on the roof of the hotel, offering great views of the river and city. There are numerous teak deckchairs making this an ideal city-respite. I also loved the park area off the lobby with banquets for lounging, and the library lounge space.

"“Good service, good hotel!” We have just spent a great 5 nights at the Hudson Hotel. The rooms while small (it is NY) are extremely clean with no scary odors (one of my biggest hotel phobias). The area is a bit far from the bars and restaurants of Soho, East village etc etc but find me a hotel in that area as good for the same price?? Taxis and the subway are so resonable and easy its not that much of an issue. Its is a great area for shopping, central park, Columbus circle and Sarabeths just past the Ritz for breakfast.... really really good. The hudson staff..fantastic, the concierge, onto it. Great Libary, bar and foyer, brilliant fit out ... a bit dark but not enough to bother complaining about. We had so much going on it was a shame we couldnt spend more time in the hotel, I would have loved to grab one of the amazing books,a glass of red wine and planted myself in front of the fire in the Libary for an afternoon. Who needs a big room when you have that to lounge out in. The only thing that I thought was a bit disappointing was dinner in the restaurant. I dont mind paying a bit for great but not for so so.

"“A Dormatory” We stayed at the Hudson Hotel for one night in late December, 2005.
I agree with the previous reviews that the rooms were pathetically small and there was not even room to open your bags.
The building used to be a YMCA and that explains it - the rooms were essentially dorm rooms.
""Trendy"" and ""Hip"" must depend on not seeing anything because the light in the lobby and hallways was almost nil. 
The dark and sparse hallways reminded me of the airport hotel in Bangkok and they were dark to the point of being unsafe.
There was wierd music playing in the lobby and elevators. I guess I've finally become my dad because the music sounded like it was composed by people with brain damage.
On the plus side, the staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. We parked about 10 spaces down from the entrance and the porter went down to get our bags with no problem.
The lobby staff was very nice and there were people stationed at the escalators to direct us from ground level up to the lobby.
Before you arrive here it is imperative to look at the photos of the hotel's entrance from their website because there are no signs to tell you this is even a hotel let alone the Hudson. I never would have known where the place was if I hadn't remembered the doorway from the photo.
The neighborhood isn't bad and you are close to Central Park and Times Square is a bit south.
Overall, it was clean and safe and the staff was great but unless you are a college student or backpacker you should spend a few dollars more and stay at a 4 star hotel.

"“Great European Modern Hotel” I signed up for TripAdvisor JUST to write this review. I was booked into the Hudson Hotel through Priceline at a budget rate of $149, 50% of rack rates. After receiving the confirmation I immediately went to check reviews for the hotel and we were really nervous. It appeared people either loved or hated this hotel. We were not sure what to expect, but...we were booked.
We loved the hotel. The rooms are small! But, so what...they are clean and extremely efficient. Space is utilized like on a boat. The hotel was trendy and modern and the hotel staff...all the way down to the cleaning personnel...were courteous, friendly and helpful.
The location of this hotel, one block from Central Park and Columbus Circle just can't be beat!
When in New York, we don't plan on staying in our hotel. The room just needs to be a CLEAN and comfortable so that you can crash at the end of the day to get energy for your next day's experience.

"“Wish I would have read the reviews first” We decided to stay at the Hudson after a friend said it was a fun and trendy place to stay. Taking their word for it and not checking out a review (what a mistake), we booked for three nights over Christmas for the rate of $ 337.96 (tax in) for two people/ 2 beds per night(another huge mistake). We had a late check in and was at first confused by the facade. The picture on the web site was obviously taken when the hotel was just opened. The front of the building was dirty, most of the yellow lighting that looked so cool on the website was burnt out and the obvious was no sign...and some ""ratty"" potted trees. 
After a bit of confusion we made our way up to the front desk (again no signs or direction)Check-in was fairly quick, however the attitude was unbelieveable ...sorry to bother your conversation!
As an interior designer the lobby and bar was impressive however once we arrived on our floor(17th)we faced west, it was a different story. It's obvious that the dark paint and carpet was to cover up the lack of repairs that was required to convert this building to a hotel properly. Very poorly lit halls and ""trendy"" lights above doors (many needed repairs)was disappointing even before we got to our room. 
The room was as it looked on the website, however only after 10-15 min of being in the room and unpacking, you soon realize the lack of planning to actually live in this thing for a few days. A lack of hangers, no drawers to keep things in, a very small unpractical desk and metal chair and really no where to put your stuff(unless to travel only with a backpack). I thought the bathroom was interesting however the commercial pressure toilet was extreamly noisy and there was a lack of space to put things on and no where to put things in.
It was also obvious that the upkeep of furnishing in this hotel is not important. I found mould in the bathroom, a broken floor lamp, a broken snack/mini bar drawer, engineered flooring that required repair or replacement, peeling paint and dusty furniture. I'm not sure when the metal shelf in the corner of the bathroom was cleaned but not before we arrived. 
My worst horror was trying to find the ice machine. I called to ask and was told that there was one on each floor...after looking again I called back to the front desk and asked again...oh ya! there is not one on 17...but every other floor has one...I decided to take the stairs up to the 18th floor...ahhhh its not part of the hotel as I soon discovered. After passing a wierd man on the stairs smoking pot I came to the 18th floor which looked like a movie set of old project housing. The carpet is dirty, the doors are old and damaged, I won't even go into the hallways except to say that I would never take the stairs again...After going back to my floor I was seriously concerned about our safty and wondered if the entire building was the hotel or just a few floors.
The heating was terrible and we were either too cold or too hot. The pipes banged all night and there was a constant breeze comming from the window which is right over your head.
The nail in the coffin was check out. We checked out at 6am to catch our train back to Canada. We decided to use our extra US travellers cheques to pay for the room but was told by the front desk that the float/till/cash..whatever was not there until 7am. What crap! We were forced to pay by Visa which after the exchange to Canadian and having to cash in our extra travellers cheques when we returned gave us a loss in exchange rates of over $ 65 CAN combined. What kind of service are they running!
I would suggest staying clear of this hotel and its affilitates. It's obvious that hospitality is there second concern.
ps: I think I left my yogurt in the window to keep cold as again...the room lacked a frige, mini bar...or even a simple coffee maker. And the room service prices..well lets just say that there is a great restaurant just around the corner and some 
small markets to pick up snacks...unless you like throwing your money away!

"“Rip off” I've stayed at a number of midtown and downtown hotels in the city in this price range (over $400/night for standard room in mid-Dec) and this was by far the worst. The attitude seems to be that if you have an interesting lobby, a hot bar, some duravit fixtures, and outfit the staff in well-taylored black you can get away with anything else.

"“Style over Substance - AVOID!” I stayed at The Hudson having spent a week at Le Parker Meridian on business and the two hotels are worlds apart. Its amazing what $50 more a night can get you!
The Hudson is the second worst hotel I have ever stayed at - only beaten by the Hotel Pennsylvania (believe the reviews - its awful). Although the Hudson isn't really a bad hotel I hated it.
My girlfriend and I booked through priceline and upon reading the reviews were a little worried. However, we came to the conclusion that 'most hotel rooms in New York are small' (my suite at the Merdian wasn't) and 'at least the reviews say its clean' (whereas the Pennsylvania was outrageously dirty and smelled). Our room at the Hudson was very clean but nothing had prepared us for quite small the room was. We had to shove the bed to one side to be able to fit our suitcase on the floor. There was very little storage. We asked if we could move to a bigger room but were told there were none available.
After the initial shock wore off we weren't too bothered with the size of the room (it is New York City after all) but we had other issues with the hotel.
First off, the staff (in the lobby and at the door) were rude. They may be saying 'Welcome to the Hudson' but they are thinking 'I'm cooler than you' (They weren't).
Secondly, we are a young couple and the attempts to make the Hudson a 'cool hangout' didn't work for us at all. Most guests (including ourselves) seemed uneasy with the loud music that is played continuously and nightclub-esque lit lobby. The music played late into the night and could be heard from our room. We asked to move to a room on the other side of the hotel but apparently none were available. (I just think the staff were too cool to allow us to move rooms).
The concierge at the Parker Meridian had been extremely helpful and pointed out some great restaurants off the beaten track. The concierge at the Hudson made me feel rude for asking if they knew of a good Italian (they didn't).
I could go on...but at the end of the day, when you are in New York there is so much to do who cares if your hotel looks good and is described in guide books as uber chic? You just want to be able to come back to a hotel with friendly staff and clean rooms after a good days gallivanting and have a rest . We were able to return to a clean room however we couldn't relax. The incessant music drove us crazy to the point of staying out of the hotel as much as possible - the hotel bar is in a courtyard and if your room backs onto this courtyard (even if you are on a highlevel) all you can hear is club music until about 12 each week night. Then the noise didn't die down until about 12.45 because people were still shouting out there. 
So in summary, I do not recommend the Hudson - I will not be staying there again.",Leyton,2005-09-01,223023,2005-12-19,False,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Good, but also lots of bad at the Hudson Hotel” Given the ""bargain"" rate I got for my room at the Hudson, it was an interesting experience staying there and not too bad, perhaps, for New York City. Of course, the thing everyone comments on here is the size of the rooms, and yes, they are small. I believe the standard queen-bed rooms are 150 square feet...think a college dorm room single, but with most of the space taken up by the bed. You have about 1 1/2 feet on each side of the bed to maneuver around, but the biggest aggravation size-wise is the bathroom. If you're tall or a bit overweight, don't even think about it. I'm neither, and I still found it a little difficult to maneuver around without bumping into something. 
Also, for the premium atmosphere this place tries to exude, it was disappointing to see paint flaking off the ceiling in the bathroom and entryway to the room. That tell me that despite all their ""modernism"", they aren't paying attention to the little details all that well. The heating system was also INCREDIBLY noisy, clanging and banging to life all through the night, waking me up from sleep numerous times.
After not sleeping all that well, I was really in the need for some coffee the next morning--but there was no coffee machine in the room, an amenity that even most ""budget"" hotels will provide! Take a look at the roomservice/breakfast menu and laugh at the prices... $14 for an omelette, $6 extra for potatos or bacon, $5 for juice or coffee...just forget about it, unless you have to be part of the ""scene"". There's a fabulous diner at the corner of 58th & 9th where you can get a wonderful breakfast for a fraction of the price.
Despite all of these complaints, I can't say it was an all-around bad experience...I just needed a room to crash overnight in that part of town, got a cheap price, and that was the end of that. The beds and linens were actually quite nice, and if it wasn't for the noice I would have slept quite well.

"“Tiny, unfriendly, and not worth the money” I recently stayed at the Hudson in New York one night for business. I was, to say the least, immensely disappointed. I had, like everyone else, read the reviews and was expecting a small room. But when I opened the door to my room, I was simply amazed--it was tiny! There is almost no room between the bed and the walls, and the room itself is no more than 12 or 15 feet deep (from door to window). Even the T.V. was tiny (and cheap)--I'd say 12 or 15 inches at most!
The bathroom is similarly small--I sat down on the toilet and my knees almost touched the wall (and I'm only 5'8""!). And if you want to take a bath during your New York trip--forget about it! All the room has is a small shower (with one wall made of glass so you can see into, and be seen from, the rest of the room) that does not have decent water pressure. Oh, and I hope you don't need conditioner--while the products inluded in the bathroom were Aveda (and therefore of reasonable quality), they were limited to shampoo, soap, and lotion.
Additional problems with my room--the cover on the speaker above my T.V. had been taken off and not replaced, a large portion of the floor was literally coming apart (tongue-and-groove boards that were broken and had half-an-inch spaces in between in which I almost cut my feet more than once), the lighting was cheesy and not very illuminating, and I was charged 1.25 for a 1-800 phone call to my airline!
The exterior of the hotel was not attractive, the escalator from the entrance to the lobby was simply annoying, the hallways were narrow and dark...the list goes on.
Quite frankly, I regret staying at this hotel and would strongly recommend to anyone that they not stay here unless they get an out-of-this-world deal (say 50, 100 bucks a night), because this place isn't worth a dime more than that.",sgusm,2005-11-01,223023,2005-11-19,False,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.4,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Won't choose the Hudson Hotel again” I have stayed at the Hudson in NYC several times, but the last visit in late October will definitely be my ""last"". While the location is good (right off Columbus Cirle, close to the park, and about 5 blocks from shopping on 5th Ave. and close to major subway lines A or C downtown or R to Soho off 7th and Broadway), there are many hotels that are even closer to the main attractions. The hotel is a great place if you're young and want to party---the hotel lobby is beautiful and the bar is very cool and packed on weekends. Otherwise, the rooms (while neatly decorated in Ian's classic minimal style) are so small they are barely functional (and I know all NYC hotel rooms are small---but this is ridiculous), the tiny bathroom is a joke, and there are no extras at all provided with this hotel---would a bottle of water be so bad?. I asked the front desk for a newspaper and was sent down the block because ""we'll just charge you $4 and it's much cheaper at the CVS"". I also stayed in a non-smoking floor, and the floor was very noisy and smelled like a bar the morning after---the room next door was smoking freely, and they weren't cigarettes and the front desk really wasn't able to do anything. The staff is quite friendly overall, but very young and not really willing to go ""the extra mile"" to help out. Also, the hotel is just becoming a bit too old and dark---not comfortable or inviting (which it never was), but it's also missing that ""cool factor"" now too and certainly not worth the price. I stayed at standby's like the Hilton NY and had a much nicer time for the same price.

"“Enigma” This place is a real enigma. Some very good points (location, roof top terrace, service etc) but also a few howlers which could easily put you off…
ROOMS
Size is everything. Book a double / double and this will no longer be an issue. Room was spotless, well designed and air conditioning worked fine, although the TV was out of action for one evening. Apparently this affected the whole building...
LIFT
A few minor delays but nothing to get worked up about (max delay around 2/3 minutes). Problem is there are 6 cars but only ever seem to be 2 or 3 in operation. Many journeys included a stop on each floor to pick up fellow disgruntled guests. I’m sure a simple change to the programming would alleviate the problem so the dormant cars actually do something!…
NOISE
Specifically booked a high-level floor to avoid street noise (per previous reviews). Hotel obliged and put me on 17th Floor. Unfortunately made little difference. The hotel is u-shaped meaning those on the inside of the ""u"" overlook the outdoor bar / atrium. Loud music plays here every night until the early hours. Light sleepers will be kept awake. My advice is to request an odd-number room as these face outwards and would probably be much quieter. 
CORRIDOR
Weakest-link. Dark and in need of a repaint and new carpet. A real let down given the quality of the other common areas. Felt like a Best Western...
Overall, I would recommend a stay here if you manage to get a quiet room and can stretch your budget to a double/double. This hotel is a real experience and you only live once!

Even though the Hudson looks like a wonderful hotel that I truly wanted to visit, my views have changed due to the unprofessionalism of its reservation staff.",msdecember,2005-10-01,223023,2005-10-27,False,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Do not stay at the Hudson” I stayed at this overpriced hotel this past weekend for just one night,and it was one of the worst experiences I've had in terms of customer service and incompetence.
First off, I tried to pay with my debit card and they claimed that they could not ""get it to work"", so they insisted that I go get cash. After walking 6 blocks to find my bank to withdraw the $500, I returned and paid in cash. Today, I checked my balance and they had deducted $1250 from my debit card, in addition to the $500 I paid in cash. When they ""could not get my debit card to work"", they were actually charging me multiple times. I am lucky I just happened to go to the bank today to cash a check because, had I not, I would have bounced my next couple of checks due to their HUGE error. Then when I went back to fix the mistake, they made me feel like it was my fault that they messed up!
After that, the place was mediocre at best... def not even close to worth the price. As trendy as this place tries to be, it is just a poor excuse for trying to cram as many people in as they possibly can. Each room feels like a shoe box. The elevator took more than 20mins to arrive one day. The lounge was overrated. I could go on, and on, and on...
I've stayed at much less expensive places in Manhattan that take an interest in ensuring that their customers are treated with respect and dignity...

"“Hudson Hotel Doesn't Really Impress This South Beach Resident” I live in South Beach, so I am used to a lot of ""we think we are cooler than you"" attitude. The Hudson, although it had a hip decor, had very snotty people working in the bar(s). I stayed there in August and September this year. Apart for one nice front desk clerk, most of the people acted like we should be thrilled to be paying $500 for a tiny, ""upgraded"" room. Yes, even with 2 upgrades the rooms are small, the design, crazy. I think the layout of the hotel is bizarre too, but I think it's due to it being a old building, which was renovated.

"“Euro-sized rooms at Manahattan Prices” The room was incredibly small - only 1 foot larger than the queen-size hard platform bed.

When you sit on the toilet, your knees hit the wall and you have to walk sideways past it to get to the shower. There was a 12"" x 3 foot desk next to the shower - just right for getting your computer cord wet. All this for $365/night.

And besides, you only need to sleep and shower in them (which by the way, is fun smudging notes on the steamy glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom), why would you go to NY and not be out and about all the time? 
Now that i'm thinking about it it's all coming flooding back- the lifts are even stylish with the animal print decor - the veiwing platform on the ?15th? floor was magnificent, the bar and garden area was stunning - 2 seconds to walk and you're on Broadway....

"“Veal calves are raised in larger quarters than the rooms here” OK, fair warning, I knew the rooms would be small. But when you take a seat in the usual place in a bathroom and find that your knees touch the wall (I'm 6 feet tall, no basketball player here), that's a problem. What could they have been thinking? There wasn't even sufficient space in the doorjamb for our safety latch to be properly mounted. It jammed every time the door opened or closed. Even two of these rooms would only have yielded a moderately-sized double, and those can't all be loadbearing walls dividing up these cattle stalls. Would love to meet the architect if he's more than three feet tall.

"“good city hotel” 4 of us travelled to New York and we had two rooms, one with a great view the other was rubbish but lets be honest, you dont travel to New York to have a great view from your hotel!
This hotel is very much in the centre of things and within walking distance of times square, broadway and the main shops.
If you require a taxi there are hotel staff outside which will call one for you and every time we needed one it took less than a minute.
I'd read on here before we went about the hotel being very chic and to be honest we were not quite sure what to expect but honestly thats the best way of describing it. In the day i suppose its just a very normal city break hotel but at night its very trendy and very hip with people of all ages drinking in the bar. There are hotel staff on the lifts at night and you'll only be able to get upatairs with a key so its safe too.
The rooms are very small and not ideal but i really dont think the majority of people spend much time in them and for us we used it as a base and it worked fine. Beds were comfy, sheets were clean and .... well, what else do you want?? Your in New York City for god's sake!!

Things like not having space around the room for two people pass at the same time, not being able to clean my self after a shower inside the bathroom (couldn't open my arms), and when my wife will seat in the bathroom, her head will be at 10cm from the wall. Just horrible. And the noise coming from the streets was very bad all night. I know its New York city, but the problem had to do with the bad insolation of the windows. Not to mention the loud air conditioning equipment mounted at the headboard of the bed. Only after complaining two times and moving around, the third room was a bit bigger...

"“Hotel Hell” This was Hotel Hell. The room was so small and the headboard was right up against the air conditioning which banged all night long. I could not sleep at all and had nowhere to go! I take issue with people who say that this hotel is soooo New York. Whose New York? I grew up in New York- and it was not this loud, ticky tack, impersonal place where you couldn't even get the attention of the staff. It might look like a TV commercial for the hip; but I would hardly call piped in RAP Musac, New York. Musac is after all musac- whether its in your dentist office, or on an elevator. 
As a description- the floors are darkly lit, cramped and painted battle ship gray- I would suppose that if you were in a boarding house in NYC, you would be use to this- but I grew up in an apartment building that had more space. There was about a foot between the bed and the wall on all sides. It was smaller than any cruise ship, second class- at least on a cruise ship, there is public space. The public space is like Grand Central- hey, at least there is a food court area to hang out at Grand Central with a magazine stand. You can't even find a seat in the lobby.

Before going I read the reviews here and was pretty scared that we were stuck with a dump. But when I stepped into the hotel I realized that this place is pretty cool. The public spaces were definitly the highlight of the hotel. But the spaces are also very whimsical, if you can't handle whimsical don't stay here-you won't enjoy it. I was pretty worried that the staff would be rude due to other reviews but I was pleasantly suprised. I was standing in the lobby waiting to check in and two employees walked by and said hello with big smiles and the friendliness continued from there. We had a room on the 17th floor and didn't hear any noise from other rooms. I had also called in advance to ask for no down comforters or pillows in the room (my fiance is allergic) and we were happy to find that they accomodated our request. The room is small but we were prepared for it. It was a cute little room. My biggest complaint is that the bed felt like a futon. They need to change that. A couple of nights we were exhuasted from the city and we don't drink but still didn't want to crash so we loved the fact that they had chess tables in the library...and the library is very hip place with a lot of people and music.

"“Style over substance” We stayed at the Hudson hotel for 4 nights which was a mistake as this hotel should only be stayed at for 1 to 2 nights max as we could not wait to leave.

We would recommend you only visit this hotel to have a meal and use the bars as it makes no difference if you are a resident as the tables are bottle service only i.e 200 dollars.

The location is very good being just off Columbus Circle where the Time Warner center is (along with a subway stop) and also only a block from Central Park. Time Square is walkable, but the subway is easier (we did both on several occasions).
Everyone at the hotel was very kind to us. My only problem with the hotel is that the rooms are very small for the price you pay. We got a low price off Priceline.com, but it was still expensive given that it was a holiday weekend. Truth is, though, that most of the other hotels with this good of a location and in this price range probably have similarly sized rooms in NYC.

"“Stay Away” Whoever coined the term 'the city that never sleeps' probably was thinking of my night at the Hudson Hotel. The disaster started the minute I pulled up to the hotel (I drove in from New Jersey for a planned 2 night stay), there didn't seem to be anybody even interested in helping me with my bags (except for possibly a homeless person on the corner). I decided to carry them up the escalator myself, to the hotel lobby. I arrived at about 3:30pm and was told that my room was not quite ready (oh joy) and that I could wait in the lounge. I asked for complimentary drinks since I had to wait for my room and the hotel rep agreed but then said that he had to step away for a moment. He returned a minute later and informed me that the room was ready. Whoa! I guess the price of two comped drinks would have set the hotel into bankruptcy. My room was loacted on the 23rd floor. How lovely you might say, no street noise, nice view, at any other civilized hotel this would have been a perk, however the genius's that designed this hell-hole decided that they would not air condition the elevators or the hallways. Oh, did I mention that it was a 95 degree day and being on the (next to top) floor, the number of stops was almost as high as my blood pressure had gotten. I arrived at my room and immediately noticed that the room was not much cooler than the elevator. I figured that since the room had just become ready, it didn't quite have time to cool off. How wrong I was! I decided to get out of there pretty quickly to do some shopping. Upon returning, although it cooled off somewhat outside, the room remained warm. I thought, ok a quick shower, iron a shirt and off I go again. Now if I was only that methodical. My mistake was that I ironed before the shower and turning on the iron completely blew the power in the room, including the air conditioner (and I think a good portion of the Bronx). Suddenly, the temperature began rising exponentially as I frantically called the front desk. They told me that someone would be right up (which they were not) and after a second call, I decided to bail out again sweaty and showerless and hope for the best later. I returned well after 10pm and although it still was not cool in the room, at least the power was restored. Three cheers for housekeeping! Although I did have thoughts of returning back to my home across the river that night, I stuck it out. Did I mention that this was one of the worst nights sleep that I've ever had!!! I called the front desk the first thing in the morning to inform them that I was checking out because of the conditions and they did offer me another room (how generous) however when I inquired if they had any better bedding (which was right on par with Motel 6) the hotel rep said in a somewhat defensive voice ""what's wrong with the bedding"".

"“Nice, quaint, and comfortable” As someone who is noise sensitive, I enjoyed my stay at the Hudson. Yes, the room is small, but it's cute. You walk in the non labeled hotel and go up a yellow light escalator to the lobby. From there after checking in, etc. you go to the left to the bank of elevators. A green light bar light up above the elevator to go up. You arrive at your floor, take a narrow dimly light hallway to your room. The dim lights are above the doors to the rooms. I have seen even more dimmer lights though. In my room you walked in. It was basically a square. You walk in and there's a smaller hallway to the bed but if you make a direct left is the tiny bathroom. My bathroom had a sink bowl, very modern, and a light that was light around the mirror. A faucet was extended over the bowl from the wall, from what I recall. There were shelves above the toilet (next to the sink) to put stuff that might usually go on a sink counter. There was a small space below the sink for the soapdish. The bathroom also had bathtub with curtain liners on both sides as the side towards the bedroom was a glass wall. I wasn't sure if it was for privacy or wasn't waterproof, thus the need for the liner. The bedroom was cute with a backlight headboard and two painted lightboxes on each side of the bed and a small table on each side of the bed with an alarm clock on one side. There was a tiny desk at the end of the bed in front of the shower glass I previously mentioned. I could read by the light easily. A tassle hanging from the headboard was the on/off switch for the backlight. I believe it was a fluorescent bar of light. I stayed on the 15th Floor. The view of the Hudson River from the 15th Floor outdoor deck was nice. It's a 22/23 floor building. Yes, there were a few people in front of me in line each time I came to the front desk. At 11pm I came down and asked the woman at the desk if there was somewhere to store my luggage the next day when I was touring, and felt comfortable asking her if I should tip him. She was sweet and she said she has had similar questions in the past as well herself. It was weird being called sir by the man who held by bags in storage and brought them back out for me.

"“trendy to the max” Just returned from a girls' weekend trip where we stayed at the Hudson. We are all 35-45 and felt like some of the oldest in the hotel... including the staff. Rooms were smallish but comfortable. I was looking forward to staying in a Starck-designed hotel, so I appreciated a lot of the fun details. Beds were really comfortable. On the disappointing side, of our 3 rooms, atleast one light fixture was broken in each one. One continually blew a fuse with just a blow dryer. All were dusty and windows needed handprints wiped from them. When pointed out to staff, none were fixed. On a Thursday night we had a hard time just getting a drink downstairs even as a hotel guest.

"“Hudson Bites” Wow does this place ever suck! The rooms aren't just small, but smaller than a cruise ship. The bathrooms are smaller than small - I can sit on the toilet and lean forward and rest my head against the opposing wall. The bath mat is too large to put in front of the shower - you have to turn it sideway. And once showering, keeping you elbows in. Miserable. There would NO WAY to get two people in the bathroom at once. My shower at home (which is larger than normal, could contain THIS ENTIRE BATHROOM.
Air conditioner works well, but it is loud and noisy. Wakes you up when it comes on. I asked for a quiet smoking room - which I got, but no ashtray, no matches. I mentioned this to the front desk and they said they'd fix. They didn't. It took another try. And they gave me a room on the street. So they'll ignore your request. 
I can here the guy in the next room closet activities. If he gets a shirt I can hear the hanger come off the rack as if I were in the closet with him. When he comes and goes - it sounds like someone is entering the room. I thought the place was haunted becaused clearly I heard someone trying to get into my door - I checked - no one in hall. It was just my neighbor opening his door.
The TV's mute button doesn't mute all the way, just go low. Should be a low button, not a mute button. The all metal chair is nasty-cold if you're in your underwear or naked.
The lighting is weird. Actually it's cool unless you need to read, then it's weird.
No mini-bar. I had some cashews the first night I was hear, and after a few days, they still haven't replenished it.
The bar is cool-looking, but if you're looking for seriously hip, this ain't it. Young-ish crowd, but you'll never find anyone interesting there. Cool? Yesterday's cool.
Ordered the chicken soup - it was awful. Any deli in town has better chicken soup. You get better out of can. It looks good and had lotsa meat.

"“Dont go there....” I was looking forward to my first stay at The Hudson. On previous trips to NYC I've enjoyed the bars/nightlife at the hotel.
Unfortunatly that is where the fun stops. My ""superior room"" was absolutly tiny. Good thing I was staying alone, it would have been really uncomfortable with two people.
Being a business traveler I have stayed at many hotels, some fancy, some not. But almost all the hotels I've stayed at have been far superior to The Hudson, except in the ""chic"" factor.
The tiny room was very stylish, but nothing more. Noisy air conditioner, extremely dim lighting, a TV that was in scale to the room (very tiny), no conditioner just shampoo, and worst (for a business traveler like myself) the wireless internet was awful it kept cutting in and out.

The rooms are very clean, very confortable bedding, good heating and cooling controls, no street noise, great staff, and a superb location. Close to Central Park and Theatres.

"“Do-able” Just spent three nights there with my husband. It's really not all that bad if you know what to expect. Yes, the rooms are tiny and you have to navigate carefully around the room to not bump into each other. We we able to store all of our belongings in the nooks and crannies..and if you can't do that, then you're probably travelling with too much stuff anyways. Ask for a streetside room as high up as possible if you don't want to hear the nightly club noise.
Beds were clean and really comfy (think futon), room was airy with lots of light coming in from the window (north facing). Staff was very friendly and helpful. Location is excellent (a block from the subway at Columbus Circle). If you don't want to eat breakfast at the hotel, Whole Foods in Columbus Circle offers a savory buffet of take-out!

"“just awfull - avoid at all cost!!” My grandfather used to have a saying - ""it's too small to fart in"". This sums up the Hudson. An example of the cheapness... the mirror in the bathroom was a painted over window - hidden by blinds.

"“Tiny rooms, but a trendy crowd” My two girlfriends and I just spent two nights at the Hudson. The hotel itself was very cool, with the chic bars, trendy crowd, cool lighting, music playing, etc. We purchased our room off of Priceline and were disappointed on check-in that we were only given a room with one queen bed and to upgrade to two double beds was an additional $90 a night. When we went up to our room, we all burst into laughter as the room was sooooo tiny. Smallest room we have ever seen. It seriously was just like a room on a cruiseship. Even the door to the room wasn't standard size- smaller like on a ship. We didn't plan on spending much time in our room, so we just made it work. If you are even slightly claustrophobic, this is NOT the room for you! The staff was all friendly and accomodating- bringing extra towels daily, delivering bottled water to us, even letting us check out late. We went to the minimart close by, however, and bought a small fan for our room, as the air conditioning isn't enough to keep the room cool- even on high.
If you plan on being out and about for most of your trip to New York, then the Hudson is a pretty happening place; close to the subway and the theater district.

"“The Hudson's not for everyone but I liked it !” I stayed at the Hudson last August, and was very nervous, having read some really bad reviews . Yes, the rooms were awfully small and a tad claustophobic, but the hip bars more than made up for it. 
Stayed there alone by myself briefly last year, went shopping in the day, met my friends at the lobby bar at night. Loved the roofgarden where you can relax, read a book and order a cocktail. The lobby is quite dark, but the decor certainly quite unusual and very chic. Service was generally quite good. 
This is a hotel which you will like if you stay for a short time ( I stayed for a weekend ) and if you're young ,chic and trendy. Not for the more conservative. Lots of bars in the hotel, so it's paradise for those who love to drink. The gym was servicable, but no great shakes.

"“Looks good, but the worst experience ever” This is the worst hotel ever, including hostels that I've stayed at during my backpacking student days. Stayed for 1 night, and the tiny room would have been acceptable (it is in NY after all!), but the lousy service is inexcusable, even for a Morgans hotel- have stayed at a few and they always look great though service is mediocre at best. And I'm usually willing to cut a place some slack if the design is amazing. I've seen some reviews that say you might like the Hudson if you are young, trendy, hip etc. I would disagree. There are far better hotels in New York even if all you want is a clubby vibe.
Only discovered this website recently and have to say this is a 2 time review- stayed for a few days back in march 2004 as well as April 2005 and felt compelled to write about it because the hotel hasn't improved and both stays left me really annoyed. It does look great, so maybe go there for a drink, but please don't spend the night!
Turned on the shower and was subjected to brown rusty water for 5 minutes straight. Fortunately I'd been smart enough to not stand under the showerhead when I turned it on. Went down to complain and was given some ridiculous excuse and NO apology. Staff completely uninterested in helping, which was no surprise. Had stayed here before and only returned very unwillingly because my friends had a ""good"" rate and wanted to try the hotel. Last time I experienced rusty water in the shower too, but not as much as this time.
The last time I stayed here (March 2004) pipes also rattled periodically through the night and kept me up. They did not offer to change my room and only agreed to do so when I insisted- I was told this might happen in my new room too and there were no guarantees. Yes, it did happen again. No, they did not offer any form of compensation for my sleep deprivation. Even a free coffee would have been nice, forget about upgrading me to a decently sized room. I think they said they were going to fix the problem, and this year there were no rattling pipes. 
This time I paid for breakfast with cash as I'd already checked out and was given an easily spotted counterfeit bill in change. The restaurant was not busy, so there was no real excuse except that the staff clearly don't know anything. Not that they care.
There are countless other hotels that manage to look great and function properly. What is a hotel for if you can't sleep and shower there?

"“Starck!” We stayed at the Hudson, despite the reviews! And had a great time! The hotel was packed with EURO visitors that flew in for THE GATES in Central Park! The place was buzzing and the staff very attentive. Yes the bathrooms are small, but how much time do you need to spend in there!! The only issue we had was trying to get in / out of an elevator with the place filled to capacity!

"“Style over substance” We arrived at the Hudson with jetlag to find that our room had vanished and we would be transferred to a suite for one night only.
The suite was lovely - which meant that our transfer to a smaller room was all the more painful - even though we had been warned in advance to expect a shoe box. It barely had room for all the shoe boxes containing my shopping! 
The breakfast buffet was cold - it was safer to stick to the muffins than try the cooked breakfast. 
Where the hotel did score, however, was in terms of location and cocktail ambience. It was a short walk from many of the best shops and restaurants in New York and the perfect place for an unfashionably early cocktail each evening before venturing out (Just don't look at the bill too closely). We liked the funky reception, lobby bar and library bar - somehow it felt like the middle of the night, even during the day!
We did have a fantastic weekend - but I'm not sure if we would stay in the Hudson again.",Anton H,2004-11-01,223023,2005-05-22,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Delivers what it promises” I hadn’t stayed at the Hudson recently and we were pleasantly surprised. For those of you not familiar with it, the Hudson is the modern, minimalist hip hotel offering micro-sized rooms in a fantastic Upper West Side location. I remember thinking the service was somewhat impersonal the last time I was here, but this time around everyone seemed friendly and willing to help.
The rooms are tiny. The hotel says they are “modeled on a cruise ship cabin” and they ain’t kidding. Still, the design of the rooms is very interesting. The bathroom was tiny and yet looked modern and the hotel supplied high quality amenities. The bed was comfortable and fitted with high quality linens. And in the hotel’s defense, my girlfriend didn’t think the rooms were as small as I did.
Like a lot of “hip” hotels, the Hudson is dark. Everyone looks better in dark, indirect lighting, and so does everything. Including hotel hallways and furnishings. It did not escape our notice that the hotel covers up some blemishes with dark lighting. Still, it works and it didn’t bother us. Or I should say I didn’t mind it. I think my girlfriend thought they should brighten things up a little.
The lobby and bar downstairs is not to be missed if for no other reason than the fact that they have some wonderful people-watching. We spent a couple hours gawking at the hipsters and drinking the only moderately overpriced martinis in the fairly crowded watering hole. The place was busy and we were there on a random Tuesday night.
There are times when the hotel seems a bit much. In the morning I felt like searching the hallways for the light switch – no need to keep it so dark at 8:00 AM. And the hotel posts a bouncer by the elevators, ostensibly to keep bar guests from wandering upstairs, but it seemed a bit affected. And the hotel has no signage outside which makes it seem like it’s trying a bit too hard.
Still, I like the Hudson. I maintain it’s one of the best bargains in New York (we paid a paltry $160 - a corporate rate - for a night in a prime New York location). I challenge anyone to find a better value. The small size of the rooms can feel a little claustrophobic, but the Hudson isn’t for people who want to spend lots of time in their rooms. It’s a place to crash after a crazy night in New York. And it’s perfect for that.",,2005-05-01,223023,2005-05-20,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Tiny is not the word!” I only wish I had read reviews on this site before I booked. Small is not the word. No room to store your suitcase, and there were two of us! no draws/closet to unpack anything - lucky we were only there for 2 nights. Minibar?! A draw full of warm drinks. And forget using the bathroom if your not a small (very small) child. If you need to press any clothes - good luck - with a 2 ft table top ironing board its kinda tricky to say the least.

We spent our honeymoon at the Hudson for 1 week and loved it. Yes the drinks are over-priced. Yes the rooms are tiny. Yes it's noisy at weekends. YOU'RE IN NEW YORK CITY!!! What do you expect?!
The public areas are fabulous particlarly the library where you can sip on a $7 beer whilst chilling out by the open fire and shooting pool or playing chess. Then off to the fantastic bar for a $9 cocktail and a glorious surrounding.
The staff are very helpful. The location is central near Columbus Circle and the subway.

"“You'll definitely have an opinion about this hotel.” My wife and I stayed at this hotel after I ""blind booked"" it on Hotwire. I was not familiar with the hotel so I immediately went to TripAdvisor for some info. After reading the reviews, I was very worried that we would hate it.
At least the TripAdvisor info prepared me for how small the rooms were or I would have thought someone was playing a joke on us when we opened the door to our room. It was so ridiculously small that it seemed funny to us, and that gave us a lighthearted approach to our stay. We didn't plan on spending much time in the room and they fortunately were able to squeeze a bed in it. You're basically talking about a room with a queen size bed and just enough room to squeeze around it...providing you don't set a suitcase on the floor.
From a design standpoint, the Hudson is obviously going for a cool/chic/trendy approach; however, it is done in a very eclectic way. Overall, we liked the feel of the lobby and public areas which were a mix of cool lighting effects and a dark lodge-like decor. The Library room has a pool table surrounded by comfy couches and chairs, and was a nice place to wind down at the end of the day. The outdoor courtyard area was open but a little too chili for us to sit outside. It did appear to be a pretty cool setting however. We did also have dinner one night at the hotel restaurant and we both liked our meal. 
Overall, the one thing I can say about the Hudson is that it is unique. The design is truly eclectic and probably much more likely to appeal to the younger crowd. Although the room was ridiculously small (and noisy at night), I didn't hate it; I was almost amused by it. It did have some cool night lights but the 13"" TV was a big disappointment. If they would put small plasma TVs in the rooms, it might be just enough of a cool factor to forgive the fact that there's only about 8"" between the front of the toilet seat and the wall. The bed was fine but not up to the new standards that many of the better hotels have upgraded to. When the bed ""is the room"", you should give the customer a great bed and a plasma TV to truly qualify as a chic hotel.
The location is fairly good, just a block west of the AOL towers on 58th where there is a nicer subway stop. 
If you don't care for the trendy/eclectic design of this hotel you'll probably hate it.

"“Tiny is an Understatement” I stayed here for two weeks, and I was never able to get over the size of the rooms - however, the staff was top-notch and the maid service was amazing. The hotel grounds left too much to be desired to justify the rate they charge.
 While checking in on my first night, you have to yell to be able to hear the front-desk staff because of the club music blaring in the backround. I was tired and ready for bed, and was very surprised to learn that the first floor lobby basically turns into an uber-chic club after dark. (Maker's Mark on ice was $16). 
 When I walked into my standard room, I was expecting small, but what I got was TINY!!! I understand that Manhattan, on average, has smaller rooms than anywhere else in the U.S. (about 265 sq. ft), but this place is ridiculous! I measured the room for my own amusement and was tickled when I learned the whole room (bathroom, bedroom, closet, hallway) was 140 square feet!!!! 
 If you ever have to use the toilet, your knees will touch the opposite wall when you sit down - and I'm only 5'9. If you are above average height, then you will have to literally fold yourself in half when you use the bathroom. Another thing that baffled me was you can't open the front door if the bathroom door is open... and vice versa. I kept thinking how ridiculous it would have been to have TWO people in the same room - don't even think about it!
Overall, the Hudson was a decent hotel... very stuck-on-itself and very costly, but the location and guest service were above average.

"“Small, Noisy and overpriced” There is only one way to describe how we felt as we entered the room and that's disappointment and at that the kind of disappointment you feel when you know you have been conned to paying over the odds for something. The rooms are very small and ours was not even one of the smaller rooms in the hotel. Initially we were given a smoking room when we had asked for non smoking and had to go back down to ask for this to be sorted out. It was, but only after we were told that it had been our fault despite print out of the confirmation that specifically stated non-smoking. The bathroom was small and the water intermittently went a very off putting shade of brown. The room was noisy with a industrial fan operating just outside of the window. We decided not to order any room service as there seemed so many additional charges associated with this. If you come from Hicksville and this is your first taste of a hotel and attempt at design then you may be impressed for anyone else this hotel is a real emperor's cloths and should be avoided.

We couldn’t partake on one of the only nice outdoor scenic views overlooking Central Park or have a glass of wine on the “enclosed” Private Park. Work out facility was a joke...tv’s headphones, and some equipment were broken. Only three elavators were working at times making many guests wait up to 10 minutes to get up to their rooms, staff was lethargic at best, get your specticles out because to see the 13 inch tv from your bed is quit tuff.

The public spaces, bars, restaurants etc are fantastic. The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpfull.
If you find the telephones in the rooms too expensive then use the many public ones in the hotel. There are a couple of great diners on the block for inexpensive breakfast and coffee.

"“Hudson Hype” I just came home from a 3 day stay at the Hudson. So overrated! The lobby is impressive as is the bar & 'cafeteria'. I think they keep it dark to distract you from what is about to happen once you get to your horrible room! The beds come up to your mid-calf, the bathrooms are dingy & cheap. There are no drawers for clothing. The TV is tiny & just overall - dusty. I am so unimpressed. Stay at the W. It is way better and if you have any complaints or problems, they are so happy to help whenever/wherever. We told the desk people at the Hudson that we were not happy with the room and they made it quite obvious this was not the first time they heard this.

"“Hudson - over priced, over rated and pretentious” Over priced, over-rated and pretentious. As a first time visitor to New York I was extremely disappointed by the Hudson. $345 per night (supposedly including breakfast but apparently not when the bill was paid!). An extremely dark and miserable environment. Very small rooms, no cupboards, little hanging space, shower room 3ft by 6ft, dark, continual static problems. Housekeeping poor - torn bed covers, thin and small towels, cheap tissue. Dining service appalling e.g. breakfast plates soaking wet. One even had a butter wrap left on it after washing. Hot food only luke warm. Regularly had static shocks from door handles - problem management have been aware of for over 12 months. Also had severe shock one morning from lift button - shooting blue sparks.

"“Hudson Hotel - Close to Central Park” My daughter and I celebrated her 21 birthday at the Hudson. We stayed for one week. The hotel has a great location. It is very close to Central Park, which was a plus, and getting around on the train was easy. The hotel appearance from outside was okay. I was expecting something a little more chic. Inside it was decorated nice but dark. I felt like I was at a nightclub all the time. The rooms are extremly small. both my daughter and I are slim and petite, and we still bumped into each other. The rooms were also very dark; it was hard to put your make-up on. There weren't any dresser drawers or any place to put your underclothes. We pretty much had to live out of our suitcase. They did,howerver, provide you with a small closet. Showering was another whole exprience. The shower is small and has curtains on both sides of you, so everytime I moved around the curtains would stick to my skin. The bathroom was very small I could almost touch the wall in front of me with my face and knees. I wondered if it was code compliance? If you are a large person, you better think twice. In the bathroom there was now place to do your hair. The decor in the room was Akia style (Sweedish) okay but a little cheap looking. Housekeeping was not to great. The first night housekeeping forgot to put a sheet on my bed and a few times the maid didn't empy out my garbage can; she also didn't bother to sweep or dust sometimes. The view on the roof was great. The bar was nice, but we never got a chance to spend anytime there because it was always very busy. I would not recommend this hotel.
I will be back to N.Y but not to the Hudson.

"“For a young, hip crowd” I recently stayed at the Hudson Hotel on business. I was surprised that we had a business meeting there. There are some meeting rooms on the lower level. 
When I first entered the hotel (at 2 pm), there was disco music playing loudly and the feel was much more of a club than a hotel. I thought I must be in the wrong place! The staff were all very courteous and helpful. I had an upper level room, which I would recommend if you are interested in sleeping. Others in my group were on the lower 4 floors and could hear the club music all night. 
The rooms were well-equipped, but tiny. I felt like I was on a cruise ship. Paneled walls on either side of a double bed, which was actually like a futon rather than a standard boxspring/mattress combination. There was a tiny desk, which I could not even sit at with my laptop. 
I actually doubled over with laughter upon first seeing the bathroom- everything was miniaturized! The tub was approx 2/3 of a normal tub size with a clear window that was open to the room. This could be a problem if you are sharing a room with a colleague or friend. There was a pedestal sink, toilet and a shelf or two, squeezed into approx 3 feet of space. I am a small person, so was able to navigate fine. However, I was glad my 6'2"" husband wasn't with me- his knees surely would have hit the wall if sitting on the toilet.
All in all, I really enjoyed my stay. Great ambience downstairs, quite a club scene. Easy walking distance to many things I was interested in seeing. 
However, this is more of an ""experience"" than a hotel. I would not take young children to this place, and honestly if on business would stay elsewhere. The desk was just not practical for working on a laptop, and the bed wasn't comfortable enough to sit and work there very easily. 
If you are with a young, hip group of people, this may be the place for you!

"“Wonderful Experience” I have just returned from a four day stay at the Hudson. My wife and I went to New York for our 5 year wedding anniversary. We used Priceline and we were somewhat worried once we received confirmation of the Hudson being the hotel we would be staying in. I checked numerous sites and found everything from good to horrible reviews of this hotel. Well let me set the story straight for you. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this charming trendy hotel. We arrived, and upon arrival before we even go out of our taxi, 2 bellman opened the doors and had our luggage in the hotel! We got in early that morning and our room would not be ready until the 3pm check in time, so we left our bags with the bellman and as we proceeded out into the rain/sleet/snow, the concierge handed us complimentary use of 2 umbrellas. So far so good! Once we checked in, I was worried about the size of the room. I was expecting the smallish room of a cruise line. But, the room was of adequate size. It had a queen bed with very nice linens, down comforter and 4 down pillows. It looked beautiful and had solid wood floors throughout the room. Very stylish, and very user friendly. Now, don't get me wrong, the room was small in comparison to what you might expect coming from another city, but it was in no way a hinderance to us enjoying this hotel. The location is superb, walking distance to everything, including central park, times square, and only 1 block from a subway hub which will get you anywhere! The staff at the hotel were wonderful down to earth people who went out of their way to make sure our stay was pleasant. 
All in all, the Hudson is a very trendy, stylish hotel with smaller rooms, but with everything you want from a hotel in New York. Location, friendly staff, and most important, it was very clean!

"“One thing after another...” This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had -- for a hotel that is supposedly pretty nice. The rooms are tiny, but that was the least of my problems. The wireless internet was a mess -- I spent over two hours trying to get the service to work before I requested a new room. I had to call the front desk three times before the move was approved. I then had to wait 40 minutes for the move to happen, and the wireless service in the new room was in and out for the remainder of my stay. Key features of the new room: the heat was not working, the fire alarm was ripped out of the wall (wires sticking out in its place), and part of the wall was kicked in. The heat was finally fixed three phone calls and 6 hours later! The hotel staff was not responsive to problems at all -- when I called the front desk to explain a problem, they would abruptly transfer me to someone else without even allowing me to finish my sentence -- god forbid they would actually apologize for my problem! I travel a lot, and I'm quite used to dealing with a problem here or there at a hotel -- but this was just one thing after another, and the hotel staff made very little effort to make any of these problems go away.

"“Disappointing” I had read the reviews before our trip and was slightly worried. We stayed at the Hudson 5 nights over New Year last December/ January. We upgraded to a King bed deluxe (290 USD) so space was not an issue, the room was quite spacious and there was a wardrobe to hang clothes. However I felt really let down by the bathroom - only a shower no bathtub. After a day walking around New York, you really feel like lounging around in a bath, and that was not an option... The other major issue was the noise. We were on the 4th floor and clearly not high enough to escape the buzz / police sirens / honks, etc of NYC! The worst, however, was the air conditioning system which must be ancient and kept gurgling all night. It kept us awake for most of the 1st night and we were told this would be fixed the next day. It was mildly better over the next few days, but still noisy. We had very little contact with the staff and kept ourselves to ourselves - even checked out via the TV system. It seemed more like a tiny studio in NYC than a luxury designer hotel.

“Trendy but Overall Good” We just got back from the Hudson Hotel in New York City. We spent three nights there. The formula for the hotel is basic. Have a good restaurant and a trendy bar with an average hotel. The rooms were New York City small and nicely appointed. BUT the construction was below average (our floor was damaged and our door light almost fell off the wall). The amenities were minimal. Shampoo was provided but not conditioner. The trendy bar was good (a lot of younger people 21 - 25 years of age) and it was crowded Thursday through Saturday. The Hudson Cafeteria food was very good. We liked the ahi tuna appetizer the best. The price was reasonable for New York City. The hotel location was very good as well (located near everything and central park). Service was OK. No New York attitude noted which was good.

When I returned to the lobby, the clerk was somewhat snippy but gave me another room. Unfortunately that room, too, was occupied! I returned to the lobby when the clerk swore up and down that the room ""cannot be occupied."" Tell that to the person asleep in the room. Finally I received a third room that was unoccupied. And no acknowledgement of the fault of the hotel.

"“Fun Stay at The Hudson” I stayed at the Hudson for two weekday nights in August and I absolutly loved it. I don't think I could have found a better hotel for my stay. The Hudson is very trendy, unique, and artistic. The reception area is amazing and the bars and lounges are so much fun to be in. 
That said, you come to stay at the Hudson Hotel to enjoy the bar, the restaurant, the outside lounges, and the Skybar on the 15th floor. I would not recommend the hotel for people who are not interested in enjoying the hotel's nightlight because then you are just throwing away your money. This is most definitly not a place for travelers with children. The rooms are VERY small, albeit clean and functional. The hallways are also very dark and you almost feel as if your in maze ( not a fun one at 2am.) 
The service was helpful and professional. I wouldnt say the service is anywhere near that of the Four Seasons but it definitly was on par with the price you pay for the hotel.
My only complaints are the very small room, the dark hallways, and the price of the drinks, (14 dollar Cosmopolitans), other than that, you can't beat the Hudson Hotel when it comes to enjoying Manhattan nightlife in an outdoor atmosphere. The several hours that I spent having drinks on the Private Terrace on a 90 degree night in August are definitly among the best that I have had in New York this summer.
A great hotel for people in their twenties and early thirties.

"“The Hudson Hotel is . . .” We recently spent three nights at the Hudson Hotel. We paid a reasonable price of $140/night from Hotwire for New York. I would say that this is maybe the most unique (strange) hotel we have ever stayed at. For the most part, everything has been said about it in the numerous reviews. I agree the rooms are very small; lobby, rooms, and halls are dark. The hotel is very clean. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The rooms are very cutely appointed and a lot is stuffed into the very small space. We slept quite comfortably and spent very little time in the room. The A/C was working well but I found that if you pushed back the curtain (There are also blinds on the windows), the room was cooler because the curtain did not allow the cool air to go into the room.

"“Lost FedEx Delivery Broken Toilet” Stayed at the Hudson for eight very expensive nights at the end of September. Business/Leisure trip. I had a very important FedEX business package lost by the staff. The package was signed for but never delivered. This put a HUGE wedge into my business trip. Upon questioning the whereabouts the Manager of Security at the Hudson simply said they lost it and stopped returning my calls! The handle on our toilet broke off the first day and continued to break off everyday for eight days - we had to lift the bowl and stick our hand in to flush it! Complained everyday but it still kept breaking. Ignored our request to change rooms. Gave us $50 off our room for the last day. Seeing as we checked out at 2 am it was HARDLY WORTH IT! We paid the 'Fashion Rate' of $235 per night plus tax etc. The halls were FILTHY, room service OVERPRICED, house music pumping 24hrs OBNOXIOUS. Roof top garden FABULOUS.

It made a change to stay in something different and I have stayed in it's sister hotel in NYC, The Paramount (not happy with that one). The service was excellent.

"“Style and substance mesh more than clash” I recently stayed at the Hudson on business. I slept when I needed to and played when I needed to, so it fit my criteria for a fine hotel.
The most obvious feature of this hotel is style. Gnarled wood is meshed with sleek colored glass from the escalator ride to the front desk to the room. Light is used sparingly and only to highlight decor. Twisted forms in brown meet stark straight lines of blah gray and awesome color.
I lived in NYC for some time, so small rooms weren't an issue for me. I've lived in smaller. What got me was the darkness of my room. With all of that dark wood and style lighting I was squinting for various personal effects when the concierge called and awoke me to alert of an awaiting shuttle. I missed it. My bad and their bad. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
I missed that shuttle, methinks, because of the comfort of their beds. Sure, they're lowriders, but once you get used to them they're absolutely dreamy. I also credit the oversleeping to the bars downstairs. Chock full of hot NYC locals getting drunk and wild to throbbing music -- the bars were the highlight of the hotel. The young professionals I worked with on my trip prefered the nearby Hudson bars to any of the closer alternatives in the neighborhood. 
The staff was a bit cocky. They said ""This way, Mr. N-----"" as if it were a drill. And they were all goodlooking. And bored. And too hip and talented to be working a hotel, they thought. That was fine by me, though, because that's the New York way. 
Long and short, I enjoyed my stay. Sure, finding my room in those dark gray hallways and losing power in my room by using the iron (blew a fuse) were disquieting, but I still slept when I needed and played when I needed. It allowed me to live like a New Yorker for a bit, to taste their bitter and their sweet in concentrated form.

"“This hotel is for Europeans” We booked a room in this “3-star” hotel through priceline. We then received a message from priceleine, notifying us the room size is 150 sf max. We had to call priceline to get some explanations. But we were told that the 150 sf room is “a standard room” for this hotel. Then we called the hotel to see if larger rooms were available because we didn’t want to stay in a room smaller than any of our bathrooms. We were politely told that upgrades cost $90 more. We knew we were scammed (shame on them!) and paid for the upgrade, which made the total stay of one night more than $300.
The upgraded room with two beds was very small, very noisy and very cold. We asked the front desk why there was no heating when the temperature was in the 50s, we were told this was because NYC didn’t provide heating at that time. But they did provide three blankets to our room. This hotel has some unique styles and designs that should be commended, but the entire hotel was so dark, making it the darkest hotel we have ever stayed in the world, including European hotels. I am not surprised that reviews from the Europeans liked it, because in Europe, rooms, beds, elevators are so small, and the temperature was not kept around 70 degrees. That’s what Hudson hotel provides, plus huge noise from 57 st, a main road connecting east and west. No wonder people from SF also liked the noise, they are used to it and cannot sleep in a quiet environment. 
We only stayed one night in the cold and noisy room. Before you go to Europe, I suggest you to experience Hudson hotel at least one night.",Steve88,2005-10-01,223023,2005-10-14,False,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Fun Hotel” First of all, you must know that if you book a standard room, it's going to be tiny (around 150 sq. ft.). And storage space might be an issue. But the design is funky and modern (mix of dark wood walls and white curtains) and the beds are very comfortable. Even though the rooms are small the rates can be cheap (almost budget for new york) so thats a plus. The bar near the lobby isn't very trendy anymore but will be often packed, and looks beautiful and unique, with the andy warhol (?) floor and stark furniture. It's a fun place to have a few cocktails, which are great but expensive. the restaurant is nice for lunch or dinner, more laid back than other schrager hotel restaurant like asia de cuba.

"“Weird place, not of this world” Seven of us went to the Hudson for a weekend in April. It was a surprise for a 50th birthday and perhaps we were all a little old for the Hudson. The man checking in before me was dressed entirely in red fur. The staff is young, thin and all in black. The prevailing mood of the staff is bored. I arrived with the 'surprisee' on Friday afternoon. The staff was supposed to take her bags to another room into which her husband would check in later in the day. They never did this. When the entire group arrived back at the hotel at around 2 AM, no one was interested in helping us. In fact the young man who identified himself as the manager shrugged and looked past us. We had the right number of rooms by then, so we did the shlepping ourselves.
The halls are dim, the music new-wave/eerie, the bedside light were ladies' heads, the glass shower overlooks the bedroom. The room is teensy and the bed low. It is wonderfully comfortable however, and dressed with lovely sheets.
We had a wonderful time at the Hudson once we decided to ignore the staff as they had decided to ignore us. It was necessary to expose ourselves again to their grim indifference at checkout. They made a mistake in our favor (too bored to do math, I guess) and we decided to accept it (Thanks, Guys!). 
If you can get a good price, and you are looking for neither service nor room to spread out, try the Hudson. It's a kick.",GoodtripBoston,2005-04-01,223023,2005-07-19,False,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Felt like I slipped through the Rabbit Hole” I felt like I'd taken a pill that made me very large & the room very small. First of all, there are no drawers so you cannot eliminate living out of a suitcase....then...there is no place to put the suitcase. The one table/workstation (which is about 18 inches deep) was the only place to put a second suitcase - the first being plopped in the narrow hallway. As a result, there was nowhere to set up a laptop to work. My husband & I had to crawl around and over each other when getting ready in the morning. We also had one morning with no hot water in the entire hotel, and our last morning the elevators were temporarily out of order so we had to carry our luggage down 8 flights of stairs. Very trendy and chic though....",,2005-10-01,223023,2005-10-13,False,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Stay away, far away” When you first arrive at the Hudson and go up the escalator to the main lobby, you will likely be impressed by the decor. It is striking, even though the music from the hip bar area might invade the lobby a bit much. I learned that New Yorkers love the Hudson bar scene, and it is something. But I think you'll also learn that no New Yorker in his right mind would stay at the hotel.
We got our first negative vibe at the front desk where the girl checking us into our room could not have been any less friendly -- a single smile would have been alright. Then came the rooms.
During my stay of 5 nights, we (a friend and I) had two rooms -- one with a single queen bed and a deluxe room with 2 double beds. (We couldn't get the deluxe room until our 2nd night). The room with the single queen bed was disgraceful. The floors themselves are nice wood floors and the bed is comfortable with nice linens. However, there is no dresser or anywhere else to put clothes, other than a shelf-less closet for shirts and pants. The television is tiny. Also, there was only about 1-2 feet on each side of the bed and only a few feet in front of the bed -- it was like living in a closet. If you want a room for anything BUT sleep, you are going to pull your hair out in this place.
The room with two beds (a deluxe room that was much more expensive) was considerably larger, yet small even by New York standards. The amenities were the same -- no dresser. Where do they expect you to put your clothes?
In both rooms, the bathrooms are incredibly small. Worse yet, on the Saturday morning of our stay, the entire hotel had no hot water until early afternoon. The water was ice cold making for one great shower. 
I was also disappointed with the staff -- you'll pass them in the hall or elsewhere and you'll never get a ""hello."" I also noticed that they have no problem entering an elevator before guests, which I have never seen happen at other hotels. Of course, we also found it very difficult to get onto an elevator. Even though there are several elevators, it seemed as if few were working, you'd always wait several minutes for one, and when it finally arrived, it was already full. After a couple occasions of watching 2-3 full down-elevators pass us by, we finally took to riding the elevator up just to ensure getting a ride down -- some stay! Waiting minutes for elevators happened every single day.
Overall, I was very disappointed with this hotel and would not stay there again. The hotel is all appearance over substance, and the appearance did not even hold up entirely given the water stains on the ceilings in the bathrooms of both of our rooms. If you do stay, you better make sure you are in a deluxe room because the 150 square feet (room and bathroom) of the standard room is unacceptable.",ChicagoToTheWorld,2005-10-01,223023,2005-10-13,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“excellently designed” I actually really liked the Hudson. I wouldn't have written a review, but the last few are so negative and contrary to my own experience that I thought I would add a different perspective.
Starting with the rooms, since that seems to be the main source of controversy about this hotel, I actually did have a problem after check-in. The first room I was given had what appeared to be mold damage to the ceiling. I went back down to the lobby and was immediately given another room of the same size. They were perfectly polite and quick about switching me.
Anyway, I found the regular-sized room I had to be perfectly adequate. There isn't a lot of space, but with the alcove by the entry there is definitely enough room for shoes, coats, and suitcases. The desk and the bedside tables also provide enough space to put down books or small bags. Also, unlike other reviewers, I found that there is plenty of space to move around the bed, maybe three feet all around. The space is really used very efficiently with the TV and some other knickknacks tucked away into a small closet next to the desk. The bathrooms are not large, but again, perfectly all right. I'm 5'9"" and my knees got nowhere near the wall on the toilet, so I'd guess a person of average height wouldn't have any problems either. As for the rooms being too dark, I'd guess that some people missed the pull-cord switch for the big light on the headboard. The lighting in the rooms is beautiful and soft, and the materials used, like the wood paneling, are excellent. The bed I found to be extremely comfortable with great sheets. On the downside, the city was freezing for the couple of days I was there and my room was just a little chilly, though not uncomfortable. Noise-wise, I didn't have any problems.
Just to be fair, since I'm in my twenties and thin, I might not understand the difficulties an older or large person might have moving around the rooms. For most people, though, the rooms are very livable and cleverly designed. I also found the other aspects of the hotel to be very good as well; check-in is quick and the staff is friendly. The public areas are beautiful and give you something to do right where you're staying. Food in the Cafeteria is *really* good, both for dinner and breakfast. The location is very convenient. Finally, though at the Schraeger hotels they ""cast"" staff members more for being pretty than for service experience, I found that everyone at the hotel was friendly and competent (as well as really hot). While it's not exactly as plush or deluxe as, say, a W or the Four Seasons, it's really a great hotel in its own way.",,2004-12-01,223023,2005-10-10,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hotel for Small People?” I knew the rooms would be small when we drew the Hudson card on Priceline, but I didn't really understand how small they could be. Nor did I understand how totally out-of-place (and ignored by hotel staff) a middle-aged couple could be in any NYC hotel.
The room was smaller than any I have encountered: about 1 foot on each of three sides of the bed; a bathroom so small that you couldn't bend down to pick up a dropped tube of toothpaste and your knees touched the wall when you sat on the throne (and I am not a basketball player -- only 5'10""); a microscopic closet; no drawers or bureaus; a 14"" TV; and insufficient light to read anything but the 26 point headlines of the tabloid press. It was like a cabin on small boat -- obviously the heritage of the architect.
The halls were dark and narrow -- like a cruise ship running on emergency lighting. (Ditto for the elevators.) We wondered if they were ever vacuumed. (Who would be able to tell? And how would they see where they were vacuuming?) 
The staff were a trip too. When we arrived with luggage the door staff ignored us entirely, while tripping over themselves to attend to two model-like waifs emerging from the taxi behind us. The main bar was closed for a private party hosted by Ian Schrager. (Why didn't he quit with Studio 54?) The front desk staff were efficient and cold. (Loved their all-black attire and the headsets.)

I didn't try the restaurant. It's in a good position if you want to go to the Lincoln Center or running in Central Park.

"“Don't Be Fooled By The Exterior” Wow, this hotel was really, really bad. I can't begin to explain how poorly designed and maintained the Hudson Hotel is. Don't be fooled by the flahsy decor in the lobby and bar. The rooms are miniscule (8'x10', most of which is taken up by the bed). The bed is smaller than a full size bed (I'm 5'6"" and my feet were hanging off of the edge). The windows wouldn't open, so it was sweltering at night, but you couldn't run the a/c at night because it sounded like a bus idling 3 feet from your head. There is NO shelving or drawers to put clothes in. The lighting is terrible in the room, but at night the cheapo blinds don't block nearly enough light so it's too bright to sleep well. I had a ""non-smoking room"" which had an ashtray bolted to the wall. The hallways super dark, and one door looked like it had been smashed with a crowbar. The list goes on...

"“Our worst hotel experience yet” Against our better judgement we stayed at this hotel for four nights in September 2005. Our room was absolutely tiny and very claustrophobic. there was no storage space at all.
Our window was broken and it took the hotel an hour and a half to send someone to fix it. The noise from the street outside was unbearable. They couldn't move us as the hotel was full. They said that they would move us the next day after some insistence from me. We had to turn up the air con full blast to drown out the noise of the traffic.
They upgraded us to a room which was fractionally larger but barely noticeable. I also insisted on a room overlooking the centre of the hotel away from the traffic.
All in all, the service we received was second rate. The only person we were impressed with was the engineer (Carlton) who tried his best to fix our window and who spoke to the manager about moving us. I doubt they would have bothered if he hadn't insisted that it was dangerous for us to stay there.
The reception area was like a nightclub, very loud and noisy.
I would strongly advise against staying here, there are much better options in New York. If you must stay here, make sure you ask for a room that doesn't overlook the main street outside. Ask for a room overlooking the atrium.

There was no apology and we had to move to the correct room a day later!!

"“Hudson Excellence” Great location, very fashionable hotel for the young and young at heart. Repeat customer of the former sister hotel the Paramount, and after learning of it's sale to another chain, decided to try another Ian Schrager Hotel. I was NOT disappointed. I expect Manhattan hotel rooms to be relatively expensive and seemingly small. For the reviewers who spoke negatively about this fine hotel I think they missed the point entirely. The concept of Ian Schrager Hotels is for the socialiation of its guests. Spend time in the Lobby people watching, in the bar or disco and the restaurant... Go to you room for sleep and ...well..---. The rooms yet small are very cosy and well designed best utilising a small space. The design is sleek and sexy. I love the glass window to the shower from the main part of the room.

"“Horrible” Absolutely horrible experience! I even called a few weeks prior to my stay to express my concern about the room size upon hearing from a friend that they were small and was assured that the room we had was spacious and would not be a problem! Boy was I mislead!!! THe room is a shoebox! I have never before had this experience nor would I typically complain but this is ridiculous. There is no bureau to keep your clothes in. THe closet is about the size of my linen closet (which is not large). THe bathroom can hardly fit one person never mind a second! The toilet is meant for a toddler at best and I am in no way a big person! It was not a comfortable stay at all. My husband and I were tripping over eachother because there was no room whatsoever. The rooms are also very dark! I called the front desk when I got to my room and was transferred to the Manager. I left a very nice message and no one called me back. I spoke to the night manager upon coming back from dinner and was assured someone would be in touch. That never happened! You couldn't pay me enough money to stay there again and I certainly would never recommend it to anyone! I'm sure the accomodations at the closest Holiday Inn would be better than the one at the Hudson! They ought to be ashamed of themselves!

"“I've never read such unfair reviews!” I had a delightful stay at this great hotel and would happily recommend it. It is chic, modern, young, sexy and very well run - but that not might suit everyone's taste. The staff and service were great, the restaurant and bars are excellent and I can't fault it. The rooms are not as large as you might find in another city (and a standard queen size room might not suit a couple who weren't getting on so well) but for New York they are average size, completely clean, very comfortable and well serviced. You can see an accurate floor plan on their website. I really wouldn't get too worried by these other reviews which seem to be about about trivia such as missing bottles of shampoo etc. and perhaps the other reviewer didn't find the main room light which is turned on by pulling the cord on the headboard.

"“Rooms are So DARK” I friend of mine and I stayed at this hotel. It was my first trip to NYC, and I was very excited. We paid a lot for these rooms, and I was expecting a quality room for what we paid for. 
The hallways where very dirty and stained. The room was tiny, and there was no place to put your luggage. The worst was the ""art deco"" idea of having minimal light. Awful idea! I couldn’t see in the hallways, I could see in my room, I couldn’t even see if I was putting on makeup or not. I think I was blind by the end of trip! Get a few more lights in the room please! One small bedside lamp does not do it! I would never-ever go back there again…. I like a little light to see what I am doing…I couldn’t even tell what color of clothing I was pulling out of luggage!

"“Disappointment” We stayed there on our honeymoon and wanted to have a special hotel. The hotel reception area, the restaurant, terrace and the bar was all very nice. 
But the corridors upstairs (where the rooms are) were dark and felt dirty. We were fooled by the room description on their internet pages containing words like spacious, thinking that the room we booked was kind of big. But it was so tiny. 
We were able to move to a bigger room after two nights (for $100 extra per night) and this room was better. However we forgot a bottle of shampoo and a haircare product in the shower when moving from the small to the bigger room. We contacted housekeeping and asked them to move this to the new room, we never saw it again. It's not really the money 'lost' that bothers us, but the fact that the staff obviously feels that anything forgotten is theirs to keep (either that or they did not find it, which means that they do not clean the bathrooms).
Also when we left, one of their doormen got us a cab to go to Newark Ariport. Our driver told us that the doorman had wanted $5 from him to give him the trip.

"“Consider the Source When Reading These Reviews” The Hudson isn't your ordinary hotel. It is large in size, modern/trendy in outlook (there's no sign for the place!) and the rooms are nicely designed but are very small -in a very European way. Do you care about small? If so avoid this place. We loved it. Yes, it is lit in an interestingly trendy way. Some may say it is dark. Not dark like a cheap hotel but atmospherically lit. Some complain in this column about noise. It's not horrible. You're in New York and in a hotel near a high congestion area. If you want quiet, go to Gramacy Park for $700+ a night, ok or stay at home. We received a Hotwire rate of $196 per night for a weekend booking. An excellent value. Hotel's price was $334.

"“Simply, dont stay there.” I couldnt agree more with earlier reviews. My husband and I are just back from NY and stayed three nights at this hotel. Simply awful. Dark beyond belief, noisy beyond belief (woke us up on a number of occasions even with jet lag and a fairly hectic wedding schedule), tiny tiny tiny beyond belief. Despite being forwarned, I was shocked at how small the room was, frankly nothing prepares you for how small the rooms are. The bar is cool but stay at another hotel and come visit. Incidentally, the bar is a totally separate venture to the hotel, as we tried to reserve some seats for early evening for eve of wedding drinks and were advised of a €250 'liqour charge' which appeared to be a cash tip to the bar man to reserve the seats. We were told that the fact we were staying in the hotel was completely irrelevant. Our room cost us €498 per night and was the biggest waste of money. I am sure that we are not the only people that have felt like mugs after a stay at the Hudson. We know from other wedding guests that there are far larger more comfortable rooms to be had for less in the same area.

A dramatic entrance to the hotel with subtle yet inviting chandelier lighting which was great. The rooms were small but modern and minimalist which appealed to us! A few people have mentioned the bathrooms they had lovely deep sinks and large showers, the glass window was not a problem for us - as would surely be the case for most people sharing a double room? However, if this is the case for the twin rooms too then I can see how it could be a problem. The heater being behind the bed was particularly useful though - no stumbling across the room in the middle of the night if you get too hot (or cold), just reach up behind you - job done! The bar and restaurant downstairs were really nice, they were very modern and always busy - with GOOD cocktails, always a bonus!

"“What to make of this hotel?” OK...several months ago, I was looking for a hotel in NYC near Central Park...unable to book in at any of the ""popular"" names due to last minute planning, I went to a website I frequent and asked for ideas from anyone living in the city-and right away was told about this hotel. So, of course I came to this site and saw tons of negative reviews, primarily around service and the attitude of the hotel staff. However, I was assured by the person referring the Hudson we would love it, he has stayed there several times, etc.... So, with some hesitancy, off we went Halloween weekend.
Well, all I can say, from start to finish, we had an outstanding stay. We were upgraded at check in, giving passes for the hotel bar (a very, very popular night spot BTW), and generally treated as well as one could possibly expect. I would also reccomend the Sunday Brunch, an excellent value.
Look, the rooms are small, no doubt. And no, I wouldn't stay here for more than a couple of nights because of that. But if your looking for an extremely trendy hotel with an awesome location, I'd say based on my weekend you won't go wrong with the Hudson.

"“This hotel is SO 20 minutes ago ... an expensive dump” This hotel is so 20 minutes ago. I question those reviewers who find it hip and cool. One reviewer compared it to Sex And The City (as if to validate its cool factor). The problem with that comparison is that Sex And The City is an old show that's in syndication. This place barely qualifies as a hotel and should be placed in syndication. Yet they charge enormous prices for this rundown, skanky dump. 
The best part of the place is what you see upon entering - the front desk is rather awesome and the staff friendly for the most part. Beyond that, keep your shoes on and walk swiftly to your room. The long hallway walls are flanked in a dark battleship grey paint. Small, low lights are above the room doors. The low lighting does a fair job of hiding the filth and stains on the old carpet. Besides being dark and dank I find these hallways a little scary and do not feel safe especially given that the bar in the lobby is usually quite lively. They often have security in the lobby checking room keys but that's usually only at night. Otherwise, seemingly anyone could access the guest floors.
The room design looks initially fresh with the white bedding, but is not at all conducive to comfort or function. If you have no clothing or ""stuff"" that you haul around on trips, I guess you could be happy in the extremely minimilistic rooms. Normal people; however, usually want amenities like drawers, lights, place to stow your luggage, enough room to walk around the bed and perhaps even a comfortable chair. You won't find that here unless you get a suite.
Pole vaulters should bring their poles so they can stand in the front doorway and throw themselves into the beds. 
The glass wall between the shower and the bedroom is just silly to me. Is this so I have ample line of vision to my 13"" tv? Or is this here because I'm so cool I don't mind being naked & bathing in front of my roommate? I think somebody who is 22 and seldom leaves the farm would find it really cool. I don't.
This hotel may have been hip and cool when it first opened but it's being poorly managed and apparently not maintained in the least. It's, in short, a dump. 
Uber hip hotels are not new to me. Having worked for Andre Balazs, I know all about the Ian Schraeger brand and mentality. Regardless of the initial concept of this hotel, it's simply not being maintained and is on par with a Motel 6 along the highway. 
A rundown on my room at the Hudson (yes, I reported the broken stuff):
Toilet bowl is completely cracked and missing porcelain. There is no way it could be truly clean.
Teeny, tiny bathroom. There is virtually nowhere to stand, sit, place your toiletries. It sort of brings out the magician in you to get yourself bathed and coiffed. 
One must leap over toilet in order to enter and exit shower. I had to sit ""side saddle"" on the toilet since my knees won't fit in the space between toilet and wall. I stand only 5'4"" -- that's on the short side so I can't imagine what tall people do. Lick their knees while they use the toilet? 
The bathroom shelf is nearly falling off the wall as is the ""thing"" on the bedroom wall. Is it an ashtray? A key pod? Whatever it is, it just needs to come down.
13"" TV? Your 3 year old probably has a larger TV.
Teeny, tiny room. One must step sideways to make it between the TV table and the bed. I had to hoist my luggage over the bed to get it toward the small, dark closet. 
No lights! I get the whole mood lighting thing, but geez, give us the option of light. Let us at least see our clothing. I could barely get dressed this morning. 
Chunks of wood flooring are missing around the bedroom.

"“Rooms sizes ideal for a leprechaun or a dachsund” I had to stay in this hotel for three nights on business in New York. Everywhere else was full. It quickly became clear why this place had rooms to spare. The room was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen, and in contrast to other reviewers I did not find the $400 rate reasonable, particularly not once you had added the bizarre collection of American taxes on top of it.
The whole floor I was on smelled of cigarette smoke, and the noise from the street made sleeping a real challenge. For the first time I was grateful for jet lag. 
Every morning I complained about tepid water - both for washing and in the shower, and each time I was assured by a very friendly member of staff that the hotel manager would be in touch to correct the problem. Who knows, maybe one day my phone will ring...

"“OK......Small is being nice!!!!!!” I just returned from NY with my best friend. She was going for business and I tagged along. We have both been to NY many times but this was our first Hudson experience. The hotel is in a good location, and the service was comparable to what one would expect in this price category. However when we got to our room.....we both looked at each other dumbfounded. These are the tiniest rooms I have ever been in. Smaller than cabins of most cruise lines. They are clean and decorated in a modern style, although some touches are a little trite (lamps with faces on them). 
Do not stay here if you traveling with anyone other than a lover that you get along with famously. We spent little time in the room, but when we were there it was horrible. There is no space to move. The bathroom is miniscule. There is no storage whatsoever.....at all...seriously. The glass window in the shower that looks out into the bedroom makes for an interesting bathing event. The TV is 13 inches ...and thats being generous. 
Lobby was fine (dark, but its the look they are going for). Bar was nice....past its prime. Restaurant was decent...typical hotel. We had no problems with service or anything. But the size of the rooms will ruin your experience. We both shopped quite a bit and had no room to put anything. When you undress or change there is no place to put anything.

"“Yatch-like rooms? Where's an iceberg when you need one?” I stayed at the Hudson Hotel, a supposedly hip spot, judging by all the young, beautiful people in the lobby and bars. I'm sure the bars are great. It's the rooms that suck. From what I understand, this was a women's dormitory or something before the Morgans Hotel Group turned it into a hotel. They didn't put a lot of effort into renovating the dorms into hotel rooms.
The rooms are smaller than a typical train compartment (the hotel prefers to say they're ""reminiscent of a private cabin on an upscale yacht."" More like a fishing trawler). The wobbly steel writing desk, which is about the width of a Time Magazine, and matching steel chair, harder on the ass than a bus bench, appear to have been stripped from a prison cell. Actually, a prison cell is more sensibly designed than this room. No amount of dark woods, mirrors, and pin-point halogens can hide the fact that this room is the size of a Camry. 
The room is slightly wider than the low, Queen-size bed that dominates the space. The space can barely accomodate one average-sized person. The bathroom has plexiglass walls, which are covered with a thin, transparent curtain. So if you like privacy while you're on the toilet, forget about it. If you do sit on the toilet, your knees will hit the wall and you'll think back fondly on the spacious lavatory on the plane.
There isn't a single drawer in the room, just an open ""closet"" in front of the door that isn't large enough to fit a suitcase and that only has three hangers. There are no ice bucket in the room because there's no space for one. The tiny TV set is in a narrow cupboard, gets no reception, and makes my laptop screen seem huge. The heater gurgles and whines (even when its off), has two settings (freezing cold and blisteringly hot) and is conveniently located behind the headboard. The walls are so thin, when the guy next door called his wife on the phone, I was able to say hello to her.

"“Gives boutique hotels a bad name...” Was on business trip to NYC from DC and made reservation for 3 nights at the Hudson Hotel. My business associate and I check in and go sightseeing. When we come back, my room is boiling (90 degrees!) and AC is broken. Nobody shows up after calling the front desk 5 times and they started ignoring my phone calls. I get a call from business associate telling me that her stuff was gone from her room! It happens that they removed her stuff from her room to give the room to another guest and they 'packed' her personal stuff and put them into storage without calling her and informing her of it!!
We both get another room, I get an upgrade. When I go take a shower, there are dead bugs/flies all over the floor!! In disgust I call the front desk again and get yet another room (in a meantime, it's 10:30PM already.) I was moved to a standard room again and when I get into the shower, they didn't have hot water...By the third phone call to the manager he didn't even know what to say. Offered free night stays and free breakfast for all of us.

When we requested the waiter to talk to the manager he gave us an attitude, rolled his eyes, shook his head and totally ignored us!

"“Avoid this hotel” We had originally booked a room at the Park Central but cancelled our reservation when we read reviews on this website and discovered the PC had a terrible bedbug problem. The Hudson was recommended to us by someone who worked at Hugo Boss in the city. I think he had some connection or something. We stayed for two nights at $205/night but with all the taxes it ended up costing something like $475 for two nights. Don't expect charm. You enter the front glass doors and immediately ride up an escalator to a dimly lit reservation desk area with booming music playing to make it seem trendy, which I suppose it is. The bar is popular and although we tried to go in Fri. night, we were turned away because we didn't have a reservation!(for the bar) The ceiling in the bar (visible from the escalator)is artfully painted. The lighting is so dim in the hotel that near the elevators I could hardly see. We stayed in a ""standard room"" on the 12th floor. The hallway walls are all painted a very dark industrial gray, and the carpeting is also very dark. As stated in another review, the only lighting is small fluorescent lights above the door numbers. The room is teeny tiny with room enough for our queensized bed. It's true that the room was either too hot or too cold. The heating does make banging noises when it comes on, and the windows allow cold air to come into the room. And we could hear so much noise outside that we slept fitfully both nights. The bathroom is interesting...The sink is one of those modern ones that feels awkward to use somehow. A mere 8"" away is the toilet and about 10"" from there is the small tub. The wall inside the tub/shower is glass giving you a great view of the bedroom and vice versa! There is a thin curtain you can pull to afford yourself some privacy, but nonetheless if bathroom privacy is important to you (and it is to many women) forget this place! The place is definitely clean, and the sheets were nice and smooth, but honestly I couldn't wait to get out of there. I guess they think that darkness equals affluence or something like that. Frankly, I felt like I was getting macular degeneration. I hear the Holiday Inn is really nice on 57th Street and less money.

"“Loved the hotel; hated the small size” Usually staying at a W Hotel but wanting to try something new, I checked out Hudson for 2 nights. This is one amazing hotel!

"“Worst Hotel Ever!” The Hudson is undoubtably the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. I would not stay there again even if it were free! I have been to New York, NY a couple of times, and I know that the room are generally smaller than rooms in other cities (I travel a fair bit), but this place was laughable. I guess being trendy means being terrribly uncomfortable. There really is only about one foot around the double bed - which is really a futon, and the bathroom is so small my knees touched the wall when I was on the loo (I'm only 5'5""). The closet is so small the suitcase doesn't fit, so you have to leave it the small hallway by the bathroom. The bathroom has a glass shower that looks to the ""bedroom"". If you're travelling with someone who's an exhibitionist and you're a voyeur, it's fine - otherwise it's ridiculous. The lighting is bad, it is so dark. There are not enough plug-ins, if you're female (or male, whatever) and you like to do your hair and make-up, forget it - there is no place to put your stuff. I'm certain there was some kind of mold, because I got terribly congested - moved hotels after one night, no congestion... The very dark exterior hallways aren't dark enough to hide the stains on the carpets. The staff was snotty and very ineffiecient. The restuarant ""The Cafeteria"" was expensive for what you got and the service was terrible. It also has long tables like a cafeteria and benches. Sorry, but if I'm spending $30 on an entre I want a proper chair and I don't want to sit with strangers. One night was more than I could take, so I moved over to The Marriot - same price, real bed, real bathroom, clean, great staff.........need I say more!",BrookerA,2004-05-01,223023,2004-05-13,False,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

The check in staff were professional and friendly. The rooms were TINY but clean no chipped paint and the bed was really comfortable. It is a great location near subway station and within walking distance of all the sights. I had no noise in my room ( i was on the 19th floor) and had a lovely view. Took us a while to find the lights which are disguised as pictures at the side of the bed and a tassle at the back of the headboard of the bed. Television was small but for the size of room perfect it pulled out from the press so was fine.

"“I've stayed in some great NYC hotels...this isn't one of them.” Ok, the hotel is cool and trendy, at least superficially. The decor is impressive; the deskclerk who checked me in was polite and professional; the bar was definately happening. Scarily though, the rooms are really, really small (and that's even by NYC standards! Hard to believe). There was a an asian fusion thing going on in the tiny room that was nice and I figured it would be fine for sleeping. 
Unfortunately sleep was the thing I didn't get. It was winter and the steam heat they use in the hotel makes a clanking that would wake the dead. When I called the front desk in the middle of the night they said I might have better luck with the heat off. It had been oppressively hot in the room and I had never turned the heat on. When I told them this they sent and ""engineer"" up to help. A half hour later when he came up the noise had stopped. He promised it would not be back. It returned about 15 minutes later. Since I wasn't sleeping I made my way to the vending machines. Apparently couples from the bar use the hallways as uh...""make out"" spots to put it nicely. It was especially unpleasant as you could see the carpets were badly stained from some kind of leak, despite how DARK the halls are. Needless to say, I wasn't really in the mood for the atmosphere. I would have to recommend this hotel for very skinny party people who are either deaf or intoxicated enough to pass out despite the noise.",,2005-01-01,223023,2004-01-20,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.6,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“I liked it - the hotel that is...” I liked it - mostly...We wanted to spend a night in NYC as a little vacation over Labor Day weekend and decided to spring for a room at the Hudson Hotel. Architecturally, it is a really nice and interesting place to stay. The outdoor patio was comfortable and pleasant.
The room was small but the design is so good looking and the bed was incredibly comfortable. It was also very clean. The hotel staff was nice.
The neighborhood was great, we left and walked around Lincoln center and found a great place to eat just 5 blocks away. The park is right there too.
The only thing I didnt like was the other patrons. When we were in the bar and on the patio early in the night is was great but when we came back from dinner at 12 it was packed and no one was allowed out on the patio anymore. People were around trying to be fabulous and not really pulling it off. It was like being in a bad club. That being said, we were able to get a few beers and find a nice spot in the hallway - there are many places to sit (for 2) and people watch.
Overall, the hotel was interesting to look at, the Saturday night scene was a bit much, and the rooms were cool.

"“Four Thumbs Down” If you're thinking of staying here...think again! And then RUN!! I've stayed at other Schrager hotels and had a nice experience, although the rooms are usually small. But here, you get to experience the rudest staff on planet Earth, and pay a pretty penny to do so. A smoke detector started beeping the first night we were there (dead battery...great!!); we called the desk before going out to dinner. When we got back, it was still beeping. We called again; ""someone would come right up."" It beeped all night, so in the morning I went to the desk and complained. Got the same story, which by then was sounding pretty stale. Needless to say, when we checked out after TWO NIGHTS, it had never been taken care of. The hairdryer in our room was broken, and there was a terrifically loud party going on in the outdoor courtyard till the wee hours of the morning. I don't mean just somewhat loud, but so loud that if I hadn't purchased earplugs to drown out the beeping smoke detector, I could not possibly have slept....we were on a high floor and the decibel level was unbelievable. And to top it off, when we went out for dinner and attempted to use the front door of the hotel to come back in, we were rudely intercepted and asked ""What are you doing?"" (No, we were not dressed like hillbillies or street people.) When we recovered from our stunned state enough to respond that we were GUESTS (remember them?? No, I didn't think so) we were told we'd have to use the side entry, as there was a private party going on. Well, excuse ME! We're only paying guests trying to get to our room and get some sleep! Upon checkout, when I was asked if our stay had been okay, I answered that no, it had not, and explained about the beeping smoke detector, the broken hairdryer, and the noise. There were NO apologies, NO offers of some kind of compensation, and NO chance of my ever darkening their door again. RUN!

"“Una piacevole sorpresa” Nonostante la maggior parte dei giudizi precedenti evidenziasse le camere come piccole, io le ho trovate di giuste dimensioni, anzi confortevoli. Mi riferisco nello specifico alla camera double double deluxe e noi eravamo in tre a dividerla. Forse saranno piccole le doppie per due, ma a questo punto se le dimensioni sono importanti basta spendere di più per assicurarsi una camera più grande! Purtroppo tutti i comfort si pagano. In una città come NY credo che la camera sia poco importante! La maggior parte della giornata la si trascorre fuori. Al mattino se non si vuole spendere una fortuna consiglio di fare colazione nel vicino le pain quotidien a pochi isolati. una colazione europea di qualità!

Premettendo che l'hotel è molto bello e ha una posizione fantastica (hai vicino la metro e ti muovi con facilità), non puoi non notare diverse lacune, che per il prezzo pagato NON devono esserci! Le camere sono estramente piccole, anche quelle superior che avevamo prenotato con largo anticipo (che secondo me, di superior non avevano nulla). E' tutto molto buio e, nonostante la hall di grande impatto, non hai un posto dove fermarti un secondo!

"“luci ed ombre” Ci siamo stati per una settimana ad agosto 2011. L'hotel è in posizione strategica: a 2 passi da Central Park e dalla stazione metro di Columbus. In 10 minuti a piedi si arriva a Times Square o alla quinta strada.
Le stanze sono piccole, ma è NORMALISSIMO a New York. L'arredamento comunque è curato e l'accoglienza di buon livello. Come dappertutto negli Usa mancano le tapparelle e quindi già al mattino presto vi è luce nella stanza. I rumori della strada arrivano implacabili fino al 9 piano.
Nel complesso un buon posto in cui alloggiare, sopratutto per la sua posizione strategica per muoversi nella grande mela. Non vale la pena fare colazione o mangiare nel costosissimo bar ""alla moda"" dell'hotel (venerdì sera frequentatissimo da giovani e ricchi rampolli e da notevoli ragazze), visto che praticamente ad ogni angolo la città offre posti per deliziosi spuntini a prezzi accessibilissimi.",apellefigliodapollo,2011-10-01,223023,2012-09-09,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Hotel comodissimo per la location ma troppo caro per quel che offre” Sono stata in questo albergo con un'amica per un soggiorno a NYC di una settimana.
Abbiamo trovato la struttura su internet e prenotato tramite il sito dell'hotel.
Ci siamo fatte convincere dalle foto e dal fatto che si tratta di un hotel di design (Philippe Starck); avevamo già in mente di non fare colazione in hotel ma fuori.
La struttura all'ingresso è pazzesca, molto cool ed invitante. La nostra stanza era al 4o piano, molto piccola, senza un armadio, con bagno minuscolo (in due non ci si sta); essendo al quarto piano già alle 4 del mattino si sentono i camion e le macchine passare sulla strada appena sotto. Molto rumoroso.

"“Camere rumorosissime, ma pulite e Ben arredate, aria condizionrumore anticamente inutilizzabile, wifi scarsa se non a pagamento!” Esperienza diretta di una camera quadrupla e una doppia.
Doppia: avevamo già letto ce le stanze standard erano invivibili, pertanto abbiamo prenotato da subito una King superior, anche essa estremamente piccola, con un upgrade di 30$ a notte abbiamo preso una stanza più grande, stavolta comoda! ( camera numero 1049)
Quadrupla: dimensioni modeste 2 letti queen size, sufficientemente vivibile. ( stanza 2314)
Bagni, datati, puliti ma un po' piccoli, nel complesso abbastanza ben forniti. 
Ogni camera ha uno schermo tv LCD 40"", phon , jbl per lettore iPhone, phon, ferro da stiro.
Nota molto negativa l'insonorizzazione, ad aria condizionata spenta sembrava di stare in un frullatore.... Ad aria condizionata accesa, non si riesce nemmeno a parlare senza urlare.
Nota negativissima, nella quadrupla ( anche melle songole standard) l'aria condizionata è posta alle spalle di uno dei due letti, pertanto lo sciagurato che sceglierà il letto con dietro le bocchette dell'aria condizionata si munisca di antidolorifici, perchè l'aria gelida entrerà sotto le sue coperte per tutto il giorno e girerà per New york completamente dolorante! L'alternativa è spegnerla ma si rischia di morire asfissiati! 
Zone comuni ben tenute, bello il terrazzo al piano 15 , peccato chiuda alle 11. Bello anche il giardino al piano lobby, ma troppo rumoroso ( motori dell'aria condizionata) e anche questo chiude prestissimo! Altra nota molto negativa, non è possibile rimanere dopo l'1 di notte nella lobby, puliscono e ti spediscono in camera. per fumare dopo le 11 ci si deve sbattere sul marciapiede davanti all''hotel!
Personale cordiale, fintanto che non si hanno problemi, infatti effettuato il chek in l'addetto si era scordato di passare la carta di credito per la seconda stanza prenotata. Bene per questa loro dimenticanza ci hanno smagnetizzato tutte le nostre chiavi, e non hanno permesso nemmeno a chi doveva effetture il pagamento , di tornare in camera per prendere la carta, tanto che un altro del gruppo ha dovuto strisciare! 
Wifi, funzionante nella lobby , nei giardini e nelle camere funziona male. Per avere un servizio decente... 10$ al giorno circa!
Dovessi tornare a New york, tenterei un altro hotel!

Auch die zentrale Lage direkt ein paar Meter vom Central Park enfernt und doch nicht auf der Hauptverkehrsstrasse ist sehr vorteilhaft.

Jedoch war ich auch im 4.Stock untergebracht was vielleicht in den oberen Geschossen weniger störend ist.

"“Das etwas andere Hotel mit winzigen Zimmern” Die Zimmer im Hudson sind wirklich sehr klein, aber gemütlich. Man sollte einfach darauf vorbereitet sein, dann stört es nicht weiter. Zum Übernachten reicht' s, für den Rest kann man es sich auf der Sky Terrace gemütlich machen (siehe weiter unten). Die Sauberkeit war im Zimmer und Bad ok, nur in der Dusche durfte man nicht genauer hinsehen. Könnte vielleicht einmal renoviert werden. 
Da die Isolierung der Fenster nicht gerade die Beste ist, hört man den Strassenverkehr von draussen. Der Verkehr wird in der Nacht jedoch etwas weniger und man kann damit leben. Unser Zimmer war im 8. Stock, ein etwas höher gelegenes Zimmer würde dieses Problem vielleicht lösen.
Die Angestellten waren nett und hilfreich.
Erwähnenswert ist die ""Sky Terrace"" im 15. Stock. Man hat hier mit vielen Blumen und Pflanzen eine gemütliche Terrasse geschaffen. Es gibt Stühle, Liegestühle, Sofas und eine Hängematte in denen man die Sonne geniessen und auch einen Drink haben kann.
In direkter Nachbarschaft findet man alle Geschäfte, die man sonst noch so braucht (Supermarkt, Coffeshop, Drogerie, usw.), Central Park, Columbus Circle und einen Zugang zur U-bahn.

"“Winzige Zimmer, aber das Hotel hat Atmosphäre” Unser Standardzimmer mit Queen Bed war wirklich winzig. Kleiner geht es nicht mehr. Rund um das Bett etwa 50 Zentimeter bis zur Wand, das Badezimmer so klein wie eine Telefonzelle. Aber trotzdem, es hatte Flair. Wer das Zimmer nur zum Übernachten braucht und sich tagsüber nicht lange drin aufhalten will, für den reicht es. Menschen über 1,80 Körpergröße oder beleibtere Zeitgenossen sollten allerdings unbedingt upgraden. Das Hotel bietet ansonsten eine sehr schöne Dachterrasse (geöffnet nur bei schönem Wetter), einen Innenhof (dito), eine sehr attraktive Bar, die sich wegen der zahllosen Bücher mit Recht  ""Library"" nennt, und einen sehr schönen Frühstücksraum. Alles in dunkelroten Backsteinstil des Hotels, das von Philippe Starck gestaltet wurde.

2) Ogni sera dall'ora dell'aperitivo in poi c'è musica ad altissimo volume fino a mezzanotte passata nel cortile sul quale danno più della metà delle camere

"“ottimo hotel ma camere piccole” hotel di design, con scala mobile all'ingresso che porta fino alla hall con edera sul soffitto e vicino all'area lounge con soffitti decorati e architettura moderna. gentili i receptionists - ce ne sono molti durante gli orari più ""affollati"" in modo da non far aspettare nessuno più di 5 minuti. ci sono moltissime stanze (circa 24 piani!), molto piccole e adatte per soggiorni brevi soprattutto per gli uomini d'affari. già 2 valigie stanno contemporaneamente aperte difficilmente.
gioielli dell'hotel: libreria, tavolo da biliardo, 1 lounge al chiuso e 2 all'aperto con amache e sofa e un bar, la hall che è sicuramente d'impatto per chi arriva. punto di forza certamente è anche la posizione, vicino a columbus circle (nelle immediate vicinanze central park, il centro time warner, starbucks...)
punti deboli (a parte le dimensioni delle camere): spa e piscina assenti, forte rumore del condizionatore di notte.

"“Ottimo design, ottima posizione...” Abbiamo soggiornato in questo bellissimo hotel disegnato da Philippe Stark dal 5 al 10 aprile. Le nostre aspettative non sono rimaste deluse, l'hotel è bellissimo, la hall è magnifica,sembra di entrare in una serra , il bar sembra la Morgan library in miniatura con l'aggiunta di un tavolo da biliardo e camino. La sala ristorante è altrettanto particolare con tavoloni e sedie che riportano al medioevo, ma in mezzo la cucina a vista con bancone in marmo bianco. Poi c'è un altro bar che al sabato sera diventa una discoteca con tanto di pista luminosa e l'ultimo giorno veniva allestita per un matrimonio, molto bella!!! Le camere: piccole sì, ma carine, letto e cuscini comodissimi, e cmq non manca nulla. Per la mia esperienza la camera grande non è essenziale in una città come NY.. in quanto in camera si cerca di stare il minimo indispensabile, doccia e dormire!!! Proprio perchè con quello che ti offre la grande mela il tempo passato in camera è sprecato. E cmq ripeto, sono molto carine anche se piccole, soprattutto il bagno o meglio lo spazio water perchè la doccia è spaziosa, e l'idea del vetro che dà sulla camera è anche molto sexy!
La posizione è ottima, due minuti da central park, da Time Square (che è veramente l'ombelico del mondo), dalla madison e dalla quinta per lo shopping sfrenato. 
Il personale dell'hotel è molto gentile sia le receptionist, sia i portieri sempre disponibili a chiamarti i taxi, ad aiutare con le valigie, sia i baristi...

"“Très sympatique hotel” Dans le cadre d'un voyage d'affaire j'ai séjourné 4jours/3nuits dans cet hôtel.
L'hotel
Le design est l'atout majeur de cet hôtel qui mélange des ambiances très différentes entre la terrasse, le bar bibliothèque, le buffet, la réception,...
L'hotel est par ailleurs bien situé pour des touristes : lignes de métro et accès facile à pieds vers les principales attractions de NY.
La chambre
L'inconvenient est la taille des chambres standards particulièrement petites : j'avais un dressing de moins d'1m² et pas d'autres rangement (de quoi accrocher et ranger les affaires d'une seule personne). Par ailleurs, alors que les couloirs sont surchauffés, la clim n'est pas mise en route dans les chambres qui se retrouvent glacées. Donc n'hésitez pas à la lancer quand vous n'êtes pas dans la chambre car le fonctionnement est très bruyant.
Le bruit extérieur est assez présent dans la chambre car il n'y a pas de double vitrage. Par conséquent ceux qui ont le sommeil léger devront s'armer de boules quies (police, ambulances et pompiers sont particulièrement sonores aux US)
Pour ce qui est de la salle de bain : très fonctionnelle, la baignoire un peu jaune à mon goût mais on apprécie la qualité des produits de bain/soin.

El loby del hotel está genial, se arman fiestas privadas que ponen muy buen ritmo y ambiente. El hotel está mas orientado a parejas que a familias. La atención del personal igualmente excelente.
Las habitaciones,aunque muy limpias y funcionales, son demasiado pequeñas, justo del tamaño de un camarote básico de un crucero tradicional, ni mas ni menos, así que llevar niños pequeños, ni pensarlo. 
Me parece que el principal inconveniente del hotel es lo ruidoso de sus habitaciones. Me asignaron una habitación con ventana hacia la calle 57th., realmente mucho ruido de los autos de la calle, y ustedes saben que en NY siempre hay autos en la calle a todas horas...!!!

gli ambienti delle camere sono molto piccoli ma con tutte le comodità compreso un letto enorme (ovviamente tutto di design).
nell'hotel c'era anche un locale frequentato dai newyorkesi oltre al ristorante ed una sala biliardo con annessa libreria semplicemente fantastica! 
la pulizia delle camere era impeccabile ogni giorno e la posizone dell'hotel sicuramente ottima (si trova di fronte al palazzo della CNN vicino al Central park).

"“Splendido” L'hotel, che già si presentava benissimo tramite il sito internet, si è rivelato strepitoso. Di design, sempre pulito e curato, molto di moda senza essere ""tirato"".
Qualche rallentamento per il check-in dovuto alle troppe persone in arrivo, ma abbiamo visto che è comunque una costante dell'hotel, perchè la reception era sempre piena.
In compenso, hanno un ottimo servizio di concierge che aiuta i clienti: avevamo bisogno di stampare delle cose e sono stati gentilissimi e molto organizzati.
Le camere hanno un solo difetto: sono molto piccole. Noi abbiamo scelto la king e gli spazi erano esigui. In compenso, sono molto belle, moderne, pulite. A terra c'è il parquet, tenuto bene, il letto è comodo, rifanno la camera tutti i giorni.
Il bagno è microscopico, ma molto pulito, cambiano gli asciugamani tutti i giorni, fanno anche il cambio dei campioncini mettendoli nuovi, è dotato di phon che funziona bene.
Il check-out è veloce: ti fanno trovare il conto sotto la porta il giorno della partenza, se tutto è corretto e avete lasciato la carta di credito come garanzia, vi basta lasciare le chiavi elettroniche nella buca all'ingresso e uscire!!
Non abbiamo fatto colazione, preferendo uscire e mangiare nei tanti diner presenti intorno all'hotel.
La posizione è invidiabile, la fermata della metropolitana vicinissima è punto di incrocio di tantissime vie che collegano con downtown, è vicinissima a Central Park e alla 5th av. e a pochi minuti da Times Square.

"“Bel Design, bello da vedere, meno bello da vivere” Uno dei primi alberghi disegnato da Philippe Starck, posizione centrale, vicino al Central Park e a pochi isolati dalle vie della moda e dello shopping e dei musei. Ingresso accattivante, moderno, si sale e si accede alla libreria, un ambiente ricco e caldo, c'è anche un tavolo da biliardo e un camino che danno ancor più un impronta ricercata. Ben frequentato sempre ma in modo particolare all'ora dell'aperitivo e del dopo cena. C'è anche un ristorante arredato con mobili antichi con al centro la cucina che contrasta con un tavolone di marmo bianco. Le camere, nonostante abbia chiesto una camera non piccola e non vicina agli ascensori, mi hanno dato una camera piccola e...vicino agli ascensori. Se questo è "" attenzione al cliente ""...forse dovrebbero imparare da altri alberghi "" meno conosciuti "" ma più attenti alle richieste dei clienti. Comunque pulite, bagno carino e, in proporzione, quasi più grande della stanza.

"“Très correct pour 120 euros à NYC !” Il y a des côtés qu'on adore et d'autres qu'on déteste dans cet hôtel... Côté bons points, il faut souligner l'emplacement, la beauté du bâtiment.

Les chambres sont propres et les prix assez serrés si on s'y prend bien (120 euros/nuit pour notre part).
Mais les aspects négatifs existent aussi. Déjà, l'hôtel est immense avec plus de 800 chambres. Résultat, ces dernières sont minuscules (13m2) malgré un bon agencement. Le designer Starck a imaginé des cabines de bateau. C'est exactement ça. Il ne faut pas prendre cet hôtel pour être à son aise. SI on le sait, tout va bien d'autant que la literie est très correcte. 
Aussi, le personnel est assez désagréable, désintéressé et ne fait aucun effort.

"“Posizione magnifica, camere pulite ma mini” New York vale qualunque spesa, è una città talmente grandiosa e coinvolgente che la sistemazione passa veramente in secondo piano. Abbiamo scelto questo hotel per la posizione magnifica (Columbus Circle, metro e Central Park raggiungibili in 5 minuti a piedi) e per l'assenza di moquette nelle camere (cosa rara in USA). Stanza piccina ma non invivibile (e poi chi va a NY per stare in camera?!? si gira anche sotto la pioggia, tutto è da vedere e gli ottimi collegamenti ti consentono di girare la città a piedi). Abbiamo gradito molto la pulizia, le lenzuola immacolate, il letto molto comodo ma occhio alla misura, queen size è un 140 quindi stretto, poco più ampio di un letto a una piazza e mezzo; suggestiva la hall animata a ogni ora da un vivace via vai di giovani di ogni nazionalità, splendida e bohemienne la terrazza alle spalle della reception, personale gentilissimo e disponibile; note dolenti? I prezzi delle stanze, sproporzionati rispetto a quello che offrono, troppo cara anche la colazione (30$ a testa... sconsigliata, anche se la saletta è deliziosa e il menu gustoso, a due passi dall'hotel si trova un classico Starbucks dove per una ricca colazione con caffè, torta e yogurt maxi non spenderete più di 10$), optate per un'altra sistemazione se viaggiate con bagagli ingombranti perché la misura della stanza e l'assenza di armadi vi creerà qualche impaccio.",silvia n,2011-10-01,223023,2012-01-05,False,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Habitaciones pequeñas, bien situado” El personal no habla español, pero es muy amable, y hace lo posible por entenderte, por lo cual, no te sera difícil comunicartes con ellos. Creo que únicamente una persona que trabaja en el hotal puede hablar español pero no sé en qué puesto.
La ubicación del hotel es muy buena, muy cerca de Central Park y de la estación Columbus Circle, que puedes luego usar para volver al Aeropuerto, por donde pasa la línea azul.
Hay ruido por el aire acondicionado, cuando enciendes la calefacción, en cuanto empieza a funcionar, se escucha un ruido insoportable del motor. En cuanto al ruido, tuvimos que hacer un cambio de habitación por motivos organizativos, y se escuchaban gritos en las paredes contiguas, con lo cual no pudimos dormir esa noche. 
La habitación es pequeña, con un armario ubicado en una de las columnas, que lo localizas cuando ves el tirador. Y un espacio para colgar varias prendas junto a la puerta de entrada.
Pero lo más pequeño es el baño, no hay sitio p.e. para colocar el estuche de maquillaje, cuando lo estás usando, un cubículo.
Otro de los inconvenientes es que es un establecimiento masivamente ocupado, tiene pasillos interminables, con cantidad de habitaciones en cada uno de ellos, lo cual lo hace más impersonal. Y tienes que esperar bastantes minutos el ascensor hasta que aparece.

"“ottimo albergo a new york” salve,
nche se un po in ritardo ci e' venuta voglia di scrivere qualche giudizio su questa struttura.abbiamo soggiornato nel hudson hotel nel ottobre del 2010 , in occasione del nostro viaggio di nozze per la durata di 7 notti.new york e' una citta che ci e' rimasta molto nel cuore e che ci ha affascinato piu di ogni altro posto.e' come vivere un film per una settimana....senti gli stessi rumori della TV quotidiana di ciascuno di noi...
oltre le 3 gite fatte, welcome new york ( molto utile per orientari subito) , la cena sul battello ( romanticissima resta per sempre nei vostri occhi ,cenare sul hudson sotto la statua della liberta a lume di candele e con musica live ....il cibo non e' all altezza del nostro italiano per passa in secondo piano) e la gita a washington in bus ( un po lunga e washington , a parte la casa bianca non offre moltissimo da vedere ).
tornando al hotel , ci abbiamo praticamente solo dormito dopo giornate passate in gio per new york che ci distruggevano letteralmente....le camere sono minuscole ma arredate con stile e ben pulite.abbiamo avuto solo un piccolo incoveniente al check out alla reception dove volevano addebitarci consumi al mini bar che non abbiamo consumato e 2 pranzi che non abbiamo effettuato e che non sappiamo ancora da dove gli siano usciti fuori......poi dopo confrontandoci con amici e colleghi di viaggio abbiamo scoperto che hanno provato ad addebitare a quasi tutti qualcosa in albergo.....forse usanza a new york. :-D

"“Ottima posizione” Sono stata in questo hotel durante il thanks giving per 7 notti.

"“Esteticamente perfetto” è veramente un hotel bellissimo, se vi piace lo stile moderno. Ristrutturato da Stark pochi anni fa, è quantomeno da visitare per scattare due foto. Se si è clienti dell'hotel si ha accesso alla veramente splendida terrazza che si affaccia sul fiume. Questa è dotata di amaca, lettini, poltrone e via dicendo. Veramente bella. L'unica pecca, a mio avviso, sono le camere: o spendi molto e prenoti una camera superior oppure ti ritrovi in una camera che io definirei più che altro un loculo. Non c'è lo spazio per una valigia, figuriamoci due. Ecco, se avete problemi di claustrofobia o pagate di più oppure cambiate albergo, è il mio consiglio. Le camere superior invece di spazio ne hanno davvero molto, forse anche un pò troppo rispetto al necessario. I bagni sono comunque piccoli e poco arredati. Secondo me hanno risparmiato molto sull'arredamento delle camere da letto. Il ristorante/sala delle colazioni è fenomenale, con armadi alti fino al soffitto, che è altissimo. Pietre a vista. La stanza con il biliardo/biblioteca è altrettanto gradevole. Così come la hall. Insomma andatelo almeno a vedere! è vicino a Central Park, in linea d'aria è parallelo più o meno alla 5th ave, all'Apple store.",B3t,2011-01-01,223023,2011-12-10,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Buon compromesso ma probabilmente c'è di meglio” La mia camera era abbastanza OK, anche se il televisore era staccato ed il mobiletto rotto, ma quella dei miei compagni di viaggio aveva la porta d'ingresso rotta ed il riscaldamento non funzionante. 
Quest'ultimo, tra l'altro, è un fan coil installato dietro la testiera del letto. Meno male che abbiamo il sonno pesante, altrimenti sarebbe stato un serio problema.
Le camere inoltre non sono dotate di frigobar ed il wifi, ad accesso gratuito, non sempre aveva sufficiente campo.

"“Hotel muy bien situado y decente” Hotel bueno y a buen precio (reservamos 2 meses antes de ir y con esa antelación hacen buenas promociones) para la oferta que hay en Nueva York. Para nosotros cumplió su cometido perfectamente. Pasamos 1 semana en Nueva York y usabamos el hotel para descansar por la noche después de todo el día por la ciudad. La habitación es pequeña comparada con hoteles europeos, la nuestra era de unos 13 m2 con un cuarto de baño pequeño (unos 3 o 4 m2) pero con bañera grande, WC y lavamanos (más amplio que los que se ven en algunas fotos), cama de matrimonio, TV LCD grande, un pequeño escritorio con una silla. La habitación nos la dieron en la planta 14 en la esquina que da a la calle 59 y la 9a avenida, 2 ventanas, una a cada calle. El viernes por la noche el bar del hotel se transforma en discoteca. En el lobby, ese día, el ruido era importante y en la planta 14 se notaba, aunque poco, el retumbo de la música. El personal del lobby fué siempre amable y nos recomendaron buenos sitios (musicales, jazz, gospel, compras) cuando le pediamos consejo.

"“Così e così” Per l'ultima settimana della ns. luna di miele abbiamo scelto di soggiornare all'Hudson, anche leggendo le varie recensioni sull'hotel.
Appena arrivati siamo rimasti molto colpiti dalla reception, carina, giovane ma un pò troppo buia! Immaginavamo una camera carina, non strabiliante ma almeno confortevole...una delusione!!! La camera era indecente! Piccolissima, in due ci si entrava a malapena, mobili molto vecchi. Il bagno oltre ad essere vecchio, aveva una tenda intorno alla vasca di un colore che variava tra il grigio ed il marrone. La pulizia della stanza sempre medio bassa.
A favore dell'Hotel c'è la posizione, ottima! Di fronte a Central Park, per cui in pieno centro.
Il locale all'interno dell'Hotel è comodo, se una sera si è stanchi si può scendere a bere qualcosa in totale relax nella terrazza.
In definitiva posso dire che non sceglierei più l'Hudson perchè preferisco una camera più comoda e meno vecchia, anche perchè l'hotel non ha assolutamente un prezzo conveniente.",Alex0375,2011-09-01,223023,2011-10-24,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“prometía más” Nos alejamos en el hotel porque nos lo habían recomendado y los que habíamos visto en la web, nos parecía muy prometedor. Los espacios comunes, sobre todo el lobby, el jardín interior en el patio del edificio, la terraza, restaurante, pub... impresionantes!! en la terraza y el patio, se podía descansar del tumulto y se respiraba calma... el pub todo lo contrario, a partir de las 6 de la tarde empezaba a llegar gente cool y el ambiente era muy guapo... 
Pero... las habitaciones eran enanas!!! (más de los normal en nueva york, muy muy pequeñas) y eso que se suponía que nuestra habitación no era de las más... la decoración estaba bien, casi todo forrado de madera tirando a tonos cerezos, y más bien minimalista. La limpieza también bien. El baño mínimo y con muy poco diseño, tirando de las lineas más básicas y baratas (no es lo más importante, pero por no tener ni mueble de baño). Nuestra primera habitación era tan pequeña que sólo tendría unos 7m2, no tenía armario, sólo un hueco de obra para meter las maletas, y una barra con unas perchas, no había cajonera... nada... en el baño un lavamanos casi dentro de la ducha y pegadito al inodoro. A mi marido se le cruzó el cable y se quejó, nos cambiaron de habitación a una muchoooooooo más grande, con armario, espejo de cuerpo entero... como poco era el doble de grande. Pero la habitación era más baja y por tanto más cercana al pub tan visitado y afamado del hotel, así que las risas, música y brindis nos acompañaron hasta bien entrada la noche. El resto de las noches, el cansancio y la costumbre solucionaron el problema. 
A pesar de esto, el hotel me gusto, no sé si las dos habitaciones fueron mala pata ó si es la tónica general. Más que valorarlo como normal, mi valoración es de un bien, recomendable sobre todo para parejas jovenes y amigos que quieran ver un ambiente similar al caer la tarde al de sex and the city.",icmas,2010-11-01,223023,2011-10-04,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

La propreté de la chambre laisse un peu à désirer, mais le pire a été le bruit... Même les boules Quies n'y ont rien fait...

Camere piccolissime (abbiamo viaggiato leggeri, con una valigia in due persone, e non sapevamo dove metterla...; se non si sta attenti alla televisione la si prende a testate tutte le mattine alzandosi e tutte le sere andando a dormire) con bagno ingestibile (minuscolo e poco pratico, separato dalla camera da una paretina di vetro e tendina semi-trasparente...). Pulizia nella media ma non all'altezza di un 4 stelle. Sistema di condizionamento rumoroso fortunatamente gestibile e regolabile comodamente dal letto. Personale abbastanza confusionario nella gestione di check in e check out, oltre a una cauzione altissima bloccata sulla carta di credito (700 dollari!).

"“Tanto design e poi il nulla!” Consiglio a chiunque di pernottare altrove. Se proprio volete vedere quanto sia ""figo"" questo albergo, fateci un giro, bevete una birra al bar, ma non buttate i vostri soldi per una camera: noi abbiamo pernottato qui - purtroppo - dal 14 al 17 agosto 2011. Siamo arrivati circa a mezzanotte. Per avere la chiave della camera ci sono voluti circa 30 minuti (ed eravamo i primi della fila) perché pareva che la camera da noi prenotata non fosse disponibile e hanno dovuto trovarne un'altra. Questa scusa l'hanno rifilata a tutti gli altri ospiti che erano in coda dopo di noi. Le chiavi elettroniche che ci hanno dato non funzionavano. Sono dovuta scendere due volte in reception per avere una chiave funzionante (e ormai era l'1:00 di notte). Arrivati in camera il sistema di rilevazione fumi faceva ""bip"" ogni 3 minuti: ho chiamato la reception e dopo 20 minuti nessuno era apparso né rispondevano più al telefono. Sono scesa per la terza volta, arrabbiatissima, e solo allora sono stata accompagnata dal responsabile della reception che nemmeno era stato informato del problema e da lui ho saputo che non era ancora nemmeno stato chiamato il tecnico. Alle 2 siamo riusciti ad avere la camera, ma senza il sistema antincendio che il tecnico si è portato via. Il giorno dopo non è stato rimesso e solo dopo avere chiamato il manager dell'hotel è stato sistemato tutto... Nessuno sconto mi è stato fatto. Solo delle scuse con della frutta dalla direzione, ma cosa me ne faccio dopo un trattamento simile? E altre coppie si sono trovate estremamente deluse del servizio e della pulizia!
inoltre l'hotel è estremamente sporco. La moquette nei corridoi è degna della più schifosa bettola del bronx. Noi abbiamo trovato calzini e asciugamani sporchi fuori dalla porta del personale di servizio. E per i tre giorni in cui siamo stati lì in un corridoio faceva presenza fissa un bidone che raccoglieva una perdita d'acqua. Senza contare che su 6 ascensori ne funzionavano 2 o 3 alla volta.

Dopo le nostre lamentele ci hanno fatto uno sconto piccolissimo e offerto la colazione (buona e in una bella sala, ma sarebbe costata più di 30 dollari a testa...), ammettendo che l'albergo richiede una ristrutturazione.

La vasca era rovinata e il silicone sui bordi era consumato ..

Bad: Alles da was man braucht, sauber. Allerdings störend klein, ich habe mit meinen 1,90m schon Probleme gehabt, mich im Bad zu bewegen, wenn man auf der Toilette sitzt stoßen die Knie an die Zimmertüre. Naja.
Sauberkeit: alles tadellos sauber
Lobby, Bar, Öffentliche Bereiche: Super, sehr stylish, großzügig, klasse DJs und Musik. Hier fühlt man sich (zumindest als junger Mensch) einfach wohl. 
Lage: Genial fast direkt am Central Park, 10 Minuten gemütlich zu Fuß zum Times Square.

A 5 minuti dalla fermata della metro di Columbus Circle e dall'ingresso al Central Park, 10 minuti per arrivare a piedi a Times Square! E' proprio nel cuore di Manhttan.
Il personale è molto gentile e pronto ad aiutarti in qualsiasi orario del giorno...e della notte. Noi abbiamo avuto un piccolo problema con lo scarico della doccia e si sono subito presentati in camera per sistemare il tutto.
Le camere sono piccole, ma a NY trovare camere di hotel grandi e spaziose è quasi impossibile!

"“comodo, trendy, ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo” L'Hudson è il mio albergo preferito a New York. Disegnato da Philippe Starck unisce un'atmosfera amichevole, giovane e intelligentemente alla moda a spazi design, soluzioni sorprendenti, anticonvenzionali e divertenti tipiche dell'architetto francese. Dunque, con una spesa contenuta si ha la possibilità di abitare a NYC in un posto unico. Elegante, molto newyorkese, centrale, giovane. A cominciare dall'entrata, con le due scale mobili che ti sollevano alla reception-area, dominata da un banco accoglienza sconfinato e da un immenso lampadario di cristallo, finti rampicanti sui tipici mattoncini rossi americani, tutto mi piace di questo luogo. Il servizio è efficiente, le camere piccole ma eleganti, i ristoranti e i bar elettrizzanti o piacevolmente silenziosi a seconda delle ore.
La sera i ragazzi newyorkesi vengono qui a bere e far tardi. La sensazione di stare in un posto che a tanti anni dalla sua apertura è ancora uno dei più trendy della città è una delle migliori qualità del luogo.
Naturalmente possono capitare anche qui, come ovunque, piccoli contrattempi. Una volta ho fatto una lunga fila al check in, un'altra mi hanno cambiato la stanza perche c'era un guasto buttandomi giù dal letto alle sette del mattino (ma me ne hanno dato una più grande e più bella!), un'altra ancora un cameriere è stato un pò sgarbato. Ma potrei raccontare centinaia di episodi nei quali invece l'Hudson e il suo staff ha dato il meglio di sè, rendendo le mie vacanze a NYC indimenticabili.
Anche tra gli ospiti naturalmente si trova di tutto, come in tutti i grandi alberghi della città, purtroppo. Di qualcuno, si farebbe volentieri a meno (i viaggiatori non sono più quelli di una volta...). Indicato però soprattutto per ragazzi (anche solo se nel cuore) e poco adatto a gente noiosa, che non apprezza il bello, il diverso, il nuovo.

"“Muy Recomendable” Cuando uno viaja a un sitio nuevo es dificil acertar con la ubicación para el Hotel, y viendo como estan las cosas en NY en cuanto a precios y críticas uno se vuelve loco.
 Preguntamos a un amigo y nos recomendo el Hotel, por ubicación. Revisamos el precio, y era del estilo a todos.
 A mi me encanto. La terraza del piso 15, para visitar aunque no estés alojado, por las vistas y el ambiente, por la mañana no abren hasta las 10 así que uno se puede coger su cafe, de vuelta de correr por Central Park, a una calle de distancia, y disfurtar allá del momento de relax. La decoración de las zonas nobles, de revista de deco, la terraza del primer piso ideal para tomar algo antes o después de cenar, el ambiente, para mi, muy neoyorkino, y el bar cubierto del mismo estilo para tomar un cubata, bastante animado. Todo muy cool. Limpieza muy bien, algo no muy habitual en Hoteles tan grandes y en NY, personal muy atento a todo.
 Lo que no es tan perfecto, aunque yo no lo eche en falta, el tamaño de la habitación, para nosotros suficiente, dado que el tiempo que pasas en ella en un viaje de este tipo es poco, supongo que tienen suits mas grandes si viajas con niños, pero el tamaño es el necesario. Otra cosa, hacer sesiones de DJ y concientos en la terraza de la primera planta, terminan pronto, hacia las 10 o 11 pero para los que madrugan para el turisteo...

Reservamos una Deluxe Double, que supuestamente era mas espaciosa, sin embargo, cuando entramos a la habitacion, nos decepcionamos por lo pequeno que era. Luego, aunque no era el piso para fumadores, no pudimos dormir bien por el olor a cigarrillo que estaba impregnado por toda la habitacion. A pesar de estar en el piso 17, el ruido al trafico de afuera se oia demasiado fuerte, y las camas parecian de hostales de pueblos.

"“Excellemment situé, mais petite chambre” Nous avons séjourné dans cet hôtel durant 4 nuits. 
Très bien situé à côté de Central Park. Nous n'avons pas été dérangé par le bruit à l'extérieur car notre chambre ne donnait pas sur une rue bruyante. Par contre, dès que quelqu'un passait dans le couloir, nous avions l'impression qu'il était dans notre chambre (porte de chambre très mal insonorisée).
La chambre était très très petite. Je mesure 1m77 et je ne pouvais pas m'asseoir sur les WC car mes jambes touchaient le mur… La chambre faisait presque la taille du lit. Pas pratique pour trouver une place pour mettre sa valise.
Pour se rendre à la chambre, nous avons presque à chaque fois dû prendre les escaliers car il est très difficile de trouver un ascenseur libre. Ceci à n’importe quel heure du jour ou de la nuit.
Mais il n'y a pas que des côtés négatifs: 
L'accueil est chaleureux. La déco du hall de la réception est superbe. On se croirait dans une grotte... très sombre mais cela va avec l'ambiance. Décoré avec goût par Starck. 
Le bar sur le toit est très convivial. Plein de petits coins sympa pour se reposer et siroter un bon cocktail. La vue est magnifique.
A chaque étage, on peut se servir de glaçons à volonté, gratuitement. Très pratique surtout lorsqu'il fait 30 degrés comme ce début juin 2011. Il n'y a pas de minibar dans les chambres mais des distributeurs à boisson et à nourriture à chaque étage: bravo pour l'économie d'électricité !

"“Bien situé, design mais service médiocre et chambres microscopiques” Nous avons pris cet hôtel pour une seule nuit car c'était le point de départ de notre circuit dans l'Est américain.
Dans les points positifs, nous avons noté : design soigné, bien situé (Midtown Theatre District et lignes de métro à proximité), assez branché, pour une clientèle jeune, terrasse sympa sur le toit, ambiance agréable dans les parties communes (lobby, bar, bibliothèque).
Ce sont par contre les points négatifs qui ont pesé le plus dans notre jugement : cher, chambres vraiment très petites (au point qu'on ne peut même pas y ouvrir une valise), salle de bains digne du monde de Gulliver, insonorisation désastreuse entre chambres et vers le couloir, climatisation très bruyante, lits très petits et peu confortables, TV placée de côté à hauteur de l'oreiller (sic !). Rajoutez à cela un service impersonnel et un acceuil assez désagréable... et ce sera complet !

"“Arte e glamour” Effettivamente al nostro ingresso in questa struttura siamo rimasti veramente sbalorditi...e non si è trattato di ""fumo negli occhi"": luci soffuse, cristalli che pendevano in bella vista, stelle luccicanti dal soffitto retrò.
Il design è l'aspetto più accattivante della struttura; devo dire che concordo pienamente con tutti gli altri globe-trotter riguardo le stanze, visto che sono veramente piccolissime. Vale la pena fare una precisazione: sono sicura del fatto che ce ne siano di varie tipologie, ne ho potute valutare due, la nostra e quella dei nostri compagni di viaggio, per cui potrebbe valere la pena fare delle richieste al momento della prenotazione.

Ci è stato consigliato dalla nostra agente di viaggio per la posizione ed il prezzo.

Poussière telle dans les rideaux et sous les meubles, que nous en avons eu des allergies, surtout ma fille qui dormait par terre.
La salle de bains avait des toiles d'araignée et de la poussière. Les joints de salle de bains sont à refaire. Ne parlons pas du pommeau de douche rouillé. Les meubles étaient abimés et en surnombre par rapport à la taille de la chambre. Le service impossible.

Purtroppo le camere sono veramente piccole (almeno quelle a prezzi decenti...le altre non le ho viste)e la valigia ti fa da armadio in quanto non hai a disposizione alcuno spazio. 
Una volta messe le valigie in camera devi fare dei saltelli qua e la per muoverti all'interno e il letto rimane l'unico spazio vivibile.

Le stanze però sono abbastanza alte da permettere di non sentire particolari rumori fastidiosi. La stanza era una doppia classica, molto piccola ma ben sistemata, meglio andare con il partner o con qualcuno con cui si ha buona confidenza, visto che, oltre agli spazi ristretti, il bagno è separato solo da un vetro dalla stanza, oscurabile solamente con una tenda bianca. Letto comodo, bel design che ricorda gli interni di una barca e personale gentile.

"“Sehr kleine Zimmer aber gute Lage” Das Hudson Hotel liegt südlich vom Central Park in der Nähe der U-Bahn Station Columbus Circle. Vom Hotel aus kann man somit schnell zum Central Park gelangen und dort spazieren oder joggen gehen, alternativ nimmt man die U-Bahn die direkt nach Downtown Manhattan fährt.
Das Hotel hat eine imposante Lobby und eine schöne Bar. Das Personal ist sehr zuvorkommend, vor allem die Concierge Mitarbeiter kennen sich bestens aus und haben sehr wertvolle tipps wo/was in NYC gerade los ist oder wo man am besten essen kann. 
Die Zimmer sind leider sehr sehr klein, d.h. wenig Platz um sich im Zimmer zu bewegen oder seine Sachen auszupacken. Da man jedoch in NYC die meiste Zeit außerhalb des Hotels verweilt, ist es somit vernachlässigbar. 
Das Hotel hat im Keller einen Fittness Raum, der soweit OK ist. Jedoch ohne Fenster wird es dort sehr schnell muffig. Wenn man sowieso nur einmal Sport ausüben möchte, empfiehlt es sich beim Concierge ein Tagesvoucher für das Futness-Studio Equinox anzufragen (kostenlos), welches direkt um die im Ecke liegt. Dieses Fittness Studio hat alles was man sich nur wünschen kann, inkl. Schwimmbad, Sauna und Dampfbad.

"“per gli amanti del genere” Sono stato all'HUDSON a marzo 2011 approfittando di una offerta speciale di primavera. Quindi, il prezzo finale per 10 giorni era di gran lunga inferiore ai prezzi praticati durante gli altri periodi dell'anno. Nella circostanza il rapporto qualità/prezzo ha fatto la differenza. Riconosco che normalmente è un hotel abbastanza caro, rispetto ai servizi che offre, ma c'è da riconoscere altresì che è in una posizione strategica e si rivolge ad una clientela specifica: giovane! Il personale è estremamente cordiale e decisamente molto disponibile. La nostra camera era al 14° piano, quindi silenziosa. Purtroppo le camere sono decisamente piccole, ma a NEW YORk è lo standard. E noi avevamo prenotato una De Luxe, che dal sito, viene promossa come stanza più grande... ma tant'è! Mentre il bagno era grande quasi come la stanza stessa! Non abbiamo mai mangiato nè fatto colazione, considerato che non appena fuori dell'Hotel è pieno di posti in cui fare colazione e mangiare qualsiasi cosa, quindi non so quale sia il livello di qualità della ristorazione. Complessivamente ci siamo trovati molto bene, ma ripeto, il mio giudizio è condizionato dal fatto che per 10 giorni abbiamo pagato una cifra quasi ridicola. Allo stesso prezzo, in quel periodo, non avrei trovato neanche un 3 stelle! E la posizione è tra le migliori auspicabili. 10 Minuti a piedi da Times Square, una stazione della metro praticamente di fronte l'hotel e dalla quale si incrociano la maggioranza delle linee più importanti di NEW YORk, a 2 passi da Central Park. Se trovate un'offerta a 200 euro a notte per camera, consiglio vivamente di non farvela scappare. Rivolto chiaramente ad un pubblico giovane o giovanile...

"“Super Hôtel” Nous sommes restés 10 jours avec ma fille en décembre 2011 et rien à redire sur notre séjour.
Chambre propre, calme (évidement du bruit à l'extérieur mais on est à New York et c'est largement supportable) Nous étions au 19ème étage.
Personnellement j'ai beaucoup aprécié la décoration, très originale, mais je conçois que tout le monde ne soit pas fan.
La chambre pas très grande mais on était pas là pour y rester et surtout on avait largement assez d'espace pour ranger nos affaires (4 valises quand mm), ils nous ont apporté des cintres supplémentaires sans souci.
Le métro est au bout de la rue, Central Park aussi.
Il y a autour de l'hotel 2 restaurants, un drugstore et une superette ouverts 24h/24, donc même quand vous arrivez en plein décalage horaire vous avez de quoi vous occuper.
Le personnel est à l'écoute, serviable, ils ont répondu à toutes nos demandes.
Pour moi le seul point négatif est le prix du restaurant de l'hotel, le 1er matin le petit déjeuner a coûté 75$ pour deux ! après nous l'avons pris directement dans les cafés des alentours.
Pour ceux qui veulent dîner sur place après une longue journée de marche comme c'était notre cas, nous achetions des plats à emporter au sous sol du mall de colombus circle (150m de l'hôtel) il y a un énorme choix et tout est délicieux et nous les rapportions à l'hotel.

"“Horrible Nos Robaron !!” nuestra estadia fue de 4 dias en el mes de agosto del 2012 .
la habitacion es una caja de zapatos ... solo hay espacio para la cama y tiene espejos a los costados para que no te agarre un ataque de claustrofobia , el baño lindo pero pequeño , y hay un rincon para colocar las maletas y apoyar pertenencias junto a la puerta , ahi estaban 2 bolsas de unas compras que hicimos en el mall que esta en frente del hotel pero cuando quisimos guardarlas en las maletas para irnos el ultimo dia esas bolsas desaparecieron.Nos quejamos ,luego de una larga charla con el encargado de seguridad nos dijeron que nos llamarian despues de investigar el asunto, pero solo recibi un mail diciendo que yo debia llamar a zurich seguros para hablar de lo acontecido , nada mas.

Tutti gli ambienti sono molto curati e ricercati: dalla reception, alle terrazze, al ""club"" anche se confermo che le stanze sono davvero piccole. Ai rumori che provengono dalla strada non c'è rimedio, ma credo che ""nella città che non dorme mai"" sia abbastanza normale.
Al momento del check-in congelano una cifra abbastanza importante sulla carta di credito (in USA è d'obbligo averla, a titolo cauzionale la chiedono quasi tutti, dagli hotel al noleggio biciclette). A noi l'ammontare è tornato disponibile circa 10 giorni dopo il check-out, ma sono i normali tempi tecnici.
Il club che si trova all'interno dell'hotel è frequentatissimo dai newyorchesi, soprattutto nel fine settimana, e quindi se ne può approfittare anche per ""familiarizzare"" un pò con la gente del posto.

"“Mucha fachada pero con servicio deficiente” La primera impresión del hotel no vale. El glamur de la entrada y recepción, del bar y del ascensor va desvaneciéndose con la estancia. Es demasiado oscuro, parece que quieran esconder la falta de mantenimiento. Las habitaciones son pequeñas, y por tanto las camas, el baño y el armario también, y eso que me alojé en una DLX Double Double. La superficie indicada es en metros construidos no útiles, y la mía no daba ni al courtyard ni tenia vista al rio como dice la web. La ventilación es ruidosa incluso habiendo apagado el aire acondicionado. 
La Sky terraza y el Private park estaban cerrados sin que hubiera aviso de ello.
Lo peor el servicio, a excepción de Sabrina que nos hizo el check in, las demás personas no tienen maneras para tratar a los clientes. Ineficaces: pedí reserva a un restaurante y al cabo de dos horas todavía no habían ni siquiera llamado. Groseros: pedí información sobre Iglesias para ir a una misa gospel y me indicó que él no iba a la iglesia. Entregué el resguardo para retirar el equipaje y al pedir qué debia hacer indicándome de malas maneras que me apartara del mostrador. Poco seguro: Dejé el paraguas en un sofa de la recepción para atender a un amigo que llegaba y al irlo a buscar (10-15 minutos) ya había desaparecido.

"“Trendy og sentralt beliggende hotell med små rom” Vi bodde fire netter på Hudson Hotel i påsken 2011. 
Hotellet ligger nær Columbus Circle, rett ved Central Park og 15-20 minutters gange fra Times Square. T-banestasjonen 59th Street / Columbus Circle ligger rett ved hotellet, og herfra kan du ta flere t-banelinjer.
Hotellet er veldig trendy, med stilig og moderne interiør. 
Vi bestilte et standard dobbeltrom, og vi fikk et bittelite rom i sjette etasje. Sengen hadde god madrass, men var svært smal. Ettersom det var kun en stor dyne, ble det i grunnen litt for intimt. Det er glassvegg, med en tynn gardin, mellom hovedrommet og badet.
Den andre dagen vi bodde på hotellet gikk toalettet tett. Vi varslet fra i resepsjonen da vi gikk ut kl. 0800. Vi fikk beskjed om at det skulle ordnes straks. Da vi kom tilbake til hotellet rundt kl. 1600 var dette fremdeles ikke fikset, og de fortalte da at de skulle sende opp en person umiddelbart. Det kom imidlertid ingen, og vi måtte gå ned til resepsjonen enda en gang et par timer senere. Det kom da endelig en mann og løste problemet. 
Bortsett fra denne ene episoden, fikk vi god service på hotellet.
Det er en Sky Terrace i 15. etasje. Denne var dessverre stengt da vi var der, men jeg kan tenke meg at det er fin utsikt der.",sraLars,2011-04-01,223023,2011-04-26,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Moderne Herberge in New York” Vorweg muss ich eines anmerken: Man kann die amerikanischen Hotels nicht mit europäischen Standards vergleichen. Daher bewerte ich dieses Hotel gemessen an durchschnittlichen amerikanischen Verhältnissen.
Das Hudson Hotel ist ein modernes und in verschiedenen Elementen sehr stylisches Hotel. Die Zielgruppe dürfte so zwischen 25-35 liegen und das waren auch die meisten Leute die ich bei meinem Aufenthalt getroffen habe. Die Mitarbeiter waren beim Check-In wirklich sehr nett und auch bei weiteren Fragen waren sie sofort mit Karten zur Stelle um entsprechend die Orte einzuzeichnen oder erklärten es mir ausführlich. Nur beim Check-Out waren sie etwas ""knurrig"", was aber vielleicht auch daran gelegen hat, dass es früh morgens war. Die Lage ist in meinen Augen sehr gut; es liegt in direkter Nähe des Central Parks und hat alle möglichen Lokalitäten um sich herum. Die Zimmer sind wirklich sehr klein, aber irgendwie auch sehr cool. Ich habe auf jeden Fall nichts vermisst und mich sehr wohl gefühlt. Einzig die teilweise leicht maroden Fugen etc. könnten bei Zeiten ausgebessert werden.

Molto in voga per i drinks per chi non soggiorna. Starci, a quei prezzi, è un vero e proprio FURTO!

Mucha gente dice que las habitaciones son minúsculas y si bien es verdad que no son amplias, la cama es grande y muy conforable y la habitación tiene todo lo que hay tener. Tuvimos la suerte de tener una exterior con dos ventanas a dos calles. La estética de las áreas comunes estan más pensadas para salir en revistas que para ser prácticas. Si se quiere disfrutar del hotel, mejor otro, pero para tenerlo como ""campamento base"" es ideal. A 4 minutos a pie de Central Park, 20 a pie del Empire State, 10 de Times Square, 3 del metro, 15-20 del Rockefeller Center... Un buen lugar para poder ir a sitios a pie si el tiempo acompaña. Desayunábmos en Flame, un restaurente abierto las 24 horas, justo delante por la 9ena Avenida, un local dónde también cenamos la primera noche y que tiene buen servicio y una carta amplísima.",annarg26,2010-11-01,223023,2011-03-06,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Gut gelegen und recht stylisch, aber auch recht laut” Das Hudson Hotel liegt recht nah am Columbus Circle und damit in etwa an der Südostseite des Central Parks. Der recht moderne Bau ist von innen (insbesondere im ersten Stock recht stylische gestaltet und wirkt insgesamt sehr hochwertig. 
Die einzelnen Zimmer sind ebenfalls modern und funktional eingerichtet, jedoch selbst in den besseren Kategorien ausgesprochen klein und sehr dunkel.
Im ersten Stock ist eine schöne Cocktail-Bar im Innenhof, auf der jeden Abend Partys gern auch mit Lifemusik stattfinden. Man hat den Eindruck, dass auch Einheimische New Yorker die Bars des Hotels schätzen und ihren Samstagabend dort gern beginnen.
Dies ist allerdings auch die Kehrseite der Medallie: Da in den Bars im ersten Stock des Hotels recht viel gefeiert ist, ist das Hotel für Business Trips, auf denen man im Hotel idR nur entspannen möchte, nur bedingt zu empfehlen.

Non esisteva in nessuna delle due un armadio, c'era una sorta di nicchia dove mettere una massimo due valige che ovviamente non potevano rimanere aperte, il resto della roba l'avevamo messa nei posti più impensati.

"“Boutique Hotel em Manhattan” Ficámos neste hotel como parte da nossa lua-de-mel em Julho.
O hotel é enorme, moderno e com um ambiente jovem/cosmopolita. Facilmente nos cruzamos com pessoas de diversas culturas e backgrounds. Está bem localizado, pertíssimo do metro e com lugares interessantes nas redondezas, alcançaveis a pé. O lugar pareceu-nos seguro durante a noite.
O quarto era minimalista mas tinha todas as condições. A vista não era a melhor, mas percebemos que o hotel estava cheio e deverá haver quartos com melhores vistas.

"“Beaucoup de bruit pour rien” Mon ami et moi avons passé une nuit dans cet hôtel lors de notre dernier voyage à New-York. J'avais réservé une offre Breakfast included, ainsi qu'un surclassement proposé après ma réservation (suite junior). Nous sommes arrivés à l'hôtel vers 19h00. 
Service réception : A l'accueil, il a fallu re-préciser que l'offre incluait le petit-déjeuner.
Chambre : La chambre était telle que sur les photos, donc peu de déception, mais aucune surprise non plus. Cependant, elle ne paraissait pas impeccable : le parquet pas fini sous la fenêtre, une infiltration sur la fenêtre, un mini frigo vide (?)
Salle de bain : très fonctionnelle, mais décevante. La mise en avant des produits de bain plus que superficielle (une seule petite bouteille de shampoing pour deux, pas de gel douche, seulement un savon en barre), pas de peignoir (mais à priori disponible dans d'autres conditions).
Library Bar : seule bonne surprise de l'hôtel, mais encore dans une certaine mesure. Je voulais un mojito, mais il n'y avait plus de menthe... Heureusement, le billard vintage est en accès libre et donc permet de passer un bon moment...
Petit déjeuner : Encore une déception : le café au lait n'est pas inclus dans le petit déjeuner... Je m'attendais à des oeufs au bacon, ainsi que des pancakes et autres spécialités américaines. Hélas, certainement pas assez tendance : pains au chocolat et croissants, accompagnés de confiture ""Bonne maman""... Par ailleurs, il a à nouveau fallu préciser que le petit déjeuner était déjà réglé.
Grosse erreur : enfin, en partant, j'ai oublié mes lunettes de vue dans la salle de bain. Après deux jours à les harceler pour savoir où elles étaient, on m'a indiqué que rien n'avait été retrouvé dans la chambre.

近未来的なエスカレーターでフロントにあがると目の前は緑の彩りがきれいな中庭がひろがります。
この中庭とルーフバルコニーはまさしく都会のオアシス。特にルーフにあるハンモックに体をしずめて、セントラルパークから抜けてくる風に揺られ、シックな芸者ガール的な制服を来た美女達が運んでくるカクテルを飲んでいると、SATCかなにか、映画のワンシーンのよう。

Es gibt aber auch Zimmer mit Klimaanlage seitlich unter dem Fenster. An der Rezeption danach fragen. Habe auch schon ein Upgrade bekommen, weil kein Zimmer mit seitlicher Klimaanlage frei war.

Rund um das Bett konnte man nicht aufrecht umher gehen so klein war der Schuhkarton. Dusche, WC und Waschbecken quetschen sich auf gefühlte 3 Quadratmeter.

"“OK if you are a Munchkin” When people say the rooms are small, be aware that they are SMALL!!! We even got an upgrade to a Superior Standard room and it was still tiny. I have never stayed in a hotel or motel where the rooms were even close to being this small. In addition, there are virtually no amenities. the TV is 13 inch, the only place to sit is a small metal chair, there is very little space to store either closes or items. Everything in this hotel is about maximizing profit. If it can't make them money, they don't have it. Even the mini-bar is higher than a normal hotel. Also, be aware that there are no temperature controls in the rooms (even Motel 6's have this) so if it is too hot or cold, you're stuck.

"“Hudson Hotel - Horrible!” We had to go to New York City on business last summer. Being from Manhattan and having stayed in many hotels there as well, I decided to stay at the Hudson because it attracted my attention in a brochure I received from the Ian Schrager hotel group a couple of years ago. I live 5 minutes from the Mondrian hotel in Los Angeles and find that sort of ultramodern design very refreshing. 
Their restaurant, Cafeteria, is really good, especially at breakfast. (Try the delicious waffles!!!) Also we had a little safe in our room, which is nice. 
Now for the other news. 
1) Thank goodness that we did not rent a car this time as usual, because this hotel does not have a parking garage. Ok, so most of you will not be driving in NYC, so disregard this and read on. 
2) HEAR THIS ------ This is the smallest hotel room we have EVER stayed in! I am serious as a heart attack, the queen size bed in our room had only bout 1 1/2 feet on its 3 sides. I had to squeeze by my suitcase every time I got up to go to the bathroom. Though others may seem to think it is ok to stay in a small room like this, we found it so small as to actually be uncomfortable, and definitely not relaxing at the end of a long hot and muggy summer day. 
3) The bathroom was also VERY small (think hard to turn around in) and had a BAD sour moldy smell from an obviously moldy shower curtain. 
4) High speed internet access. One of the reasons I decided to stay at the Hudson was because they offer high speed internet access in all of the rooms. BUT - the access in our room was behind the bed, 8 feet from the desk!!! The phone had a dataport, but that too was next to the bed on the bedtable, 7 feet from the desk. I need to type a lot an need to do so on a desk (also VERY small, think 1 foot deep by 2 foot long decorative table) and was unable to answer email or do any real business because of this, as the room is so small that we sat on the bed when in the room and I was only able to do work when my companion was in the shower or bathroom. Please note that high speed internet access is $10/day. 
4) A nice stereo / cd player is in the room, but the tv is one of those hard to see small kitchen counter size tv's (hard to see, but remember, you are staying in a very small room so you may get used to this). 
5) The air conditioner / heater unit is right above and behind the headboard in the window, and we had to run the air conditioner because of the heat outside but it was blowing directly on our heads the whole night - again, uncomfortable. 
6) This is perhaps not a beef with the hotel, but we booked our rooms on ... and requested an early check in and 2 beds in our room. Well, when we got there, the hotel did their best and checked us in at 11:30 am (we had gotten into the city at 8:00 am) and we were informed that the class of room we had does not have double beds. VERY BAD!!! I was on a business trip with a relative (not romantically involved) and so 2 grown adults had to sleep IN THE SAME BED for 4 DAYS! If you want 2 beds in your room, you had better get it in writing and do not book this hotel through .... I would have gladly paid more had the choice been offered to me. 
7) Do not stay here with anyone (parents, children) who would be embarrased by the 24 hour a day public displays of affection by other guests in the lobby, halls, restaurant (especially disgusting scene with greasy 60+ year old man with 20 year old girlfriend in lap open mouth kissing and feeding her breakfast - ewww!), and especially the elevators. This place has to have had the touchy feeliest guests of any place I have ever stayed, even in South Beach. (Maybe the guest rooms are so small that guests are driven to the public areas to do what they wish they had room for in their guest room?) These things never seem to happen at the Hilton or the Plaza. 
So: 
A vacation in New York City IS a vacation spent outside of the room, but at the end of a long day it is important to return to something nice AND comfortable. Although the room was clean and the bed itself was very comfortable, with a duvet and the kind of linens I use at home, the rooms are so uncomfortable as to be horrible, being SO TINY!!!! 
The joke is really on any of us who have stayed there - the place used to be a sort of residence hall and I swear it used to be a youth hostel (I lived one block away from this building for 3 years 10 years ago and have been trying to remember this). So we basically went on vacation and stayed at a glorified dormitory! 
I found something on the web to back up my memory at: 
...
I am in my early 30's and am very small, and like nightlife, but with all of the great choices in New York, I can not see a good reason for anyone to stay here. The rooms are just too tiny and cramped. The rooms are also too dark and the halls and hotel are too dark. The decor features dark wood on the floors and walls of the guest rooms and common areas and dark gray paint and carpet in the halls, which are purposely not lit, like a dark nightclub - in fact the bar is better lit than the halls on the floors. It was hot when we were there and to come back to that small claustrophobic room after a long muggy day was really unpleasant. We could have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria where the presidents and world leaders stay for $11 LESS!!! 
But we wanted to stay somewhere different. If you are very young, very very small, live in a closet at home, and/or if you want to stay somewhere with built in nightlife, those would be possible reasons to want to stay at the Hudson. So if after all of this, you are so obsessed with being trendy that you are still compelled to stay there, you have been forewarned - go be their guest.",,2005-01-01,223023,2002-12-30,False,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Sehr originelles Hotel!” Ausgesprochen originelles Hotel in sehr guter Lage, ganz nah am Central Park, Subway-Station nur ein paar Schritte entfernt, viele Restaurants, Bars und Diners in der Nähe.
Das Hotel ist gewöhnungsbedürftig und sicher nicht für jedermann geeignet. Wer aber etwas ausgefallenes sucht, der ist hier richtig. Von aussen erkennt man das Hotel kaum als solches, die Aussenfassade ist recht unauffällig gestaltet. Mit einer Rolltreppe fährt man rauf in die Lobby und kommt schon das erste Mal ins Staunen... Es ist eine witzige Mischung aus Design, Ritterzeit und weiß-nicht-was, leider relativ dunkel und laut (die Musik könnte etwas runter gedreht werden), aber mir hat's gefallen. 
Das Personal an der Rezeption ist super freundlich! 
Die Zimmer sind zum größten Teil winzig, winzig klein und im Stil einer Schiffskajüte eingerichtet. Auf keine Fall sind sie geeignet für Leute, die länger auf Reisen sind und entsprechend viel Gepäck dabei haben. Auch für Powershopper nur begrenzt zu empfehlen, weil man sonst sein Bett mit dem Gepäck teilen muss. Uns hat der Platz aber gereicht, na ja , bis auf die Toilette, da muss man schon die Beine ""einklappen"".
Es gibt im Hotel eine Bar, die uns allerdings gar nicht angesprochen hat, sehr kühl und stylisch, ein Restaurant, dass um so gemütlicher war, die Bibliothek mit Cognac- und Brandybar, eine Dachterrasse (nur im Sommer geöffnet) und eine Terrasse im Innenhof mit riesigen Blumekübeln, richtig chillig gestaltet.

Allerdings waren sie sehr sauber. Vor allem das Bad ist winzig und ein Gang zur Toilette erfordert eine gewisse Gelenkigkeit! Eine schöne Dachterrasse bietet einen tollen Ausblick und weit überteuerte Getränke, im Innenhof befindet sich eine Bar und ein Restaurant. Da in diesem Bereich abends meist Party ist, werden die Innenhofzimmer bis spät abends beschallt, so dass nicht nur hellhörige Menschen evtl. Schlafprobleme haben.
Das Personal war bei unserem Aufenthalt stets freundlich und um unser Wohlbefinden bemüht. Insgesamt für New Yorker Verhältnisse keine schlechte Unterkunft, aber nur wenn der Preis stimmt. Wir hatten über Eurosun ein Doppelzimmer für vier Übernachtungen zum Preis von 486 Euro gebucht. Für diesen Preis gerne wieder, aber viel mehr sind die Zimmer dann doch nicht wert.",contrail330,2010-08-01,223023,2010-09-21,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.1,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Hudson Hotel - stylisch, gut aber nicht billig” Das Hudson Hotel ist super gelegen, zwischen Central Park & Times Square. Fussläufig kann man nahezu alles erreichen. Sehr schönes, stylisches Hotel, saubere nette Zimmer - könnten allerdings etwas größer sein. Große oder fülligere Menschen sollten sich vorher erkundigen oder upgraden. Sehr freundliches, sehr kompetentes Personal.
Tolle Frühstücksmöglichkeiten direkt um die Ecke. Alle notwendigen Dinge (Essen, Trinken, Apotheke, Starbucks) kann man direkt auf der Straße finden, keine 5 Minuten zu Fuss. 
Einen gewissen Geräuschpegel hat man allerdings immer. Ein Zimmer zum ""Hof"" (sehr schöner Hof) ist jedoch etwas leiser als zur Stadtseite. Mit etwas Glück hat man von da aus auch City-View.
Allerdings sollte man sich vorher nach den ortsüblichen Tax erkundigen, die sind nicht mit im Zimmerpreis verankert und kleckern sich zusammen. Pro Person zahlt man rund 34 Euro Tax pro Tag dazu. Das hat die tolle Stimmung bei einer Woche Aufenthalt zu zweit doch ein klein wenig vermiest.",Anie54,2010-08-01,223023,2010-09-21,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Viel zu bieten - wenig Ruhe” Insgesamt nehme ich einen positiven Eindruck mit von diesem Hotel:
Die Lage des Hotels ist fantastisch, die Inneneinrichtung ebenfalls (Ich habe den Namen des Designers vergessen, habe mir aber sagen lassen, dass jener im Moment absolut ""in"" sei). Das Personal ist stets bemüht, fleißig und zuvorkommend. Die Sauberkeit ist für New Yorker Verhältnisse weit über Standard. Es gibt sogar Zimmer, in den man rauchen kann, was mich sehr verwundert hat, da dieses Hotel doch relativ neu war. Mich als Raucher hat dies allerdings gefreut. Mein Zimmer wurde bis kurz vor meinem Einzug mit einem Ozongerät behandelt, was den kalten Rauch der früheren Gäste fast ganz verschwinden ließ. Ebenfalls war ein Late Check-Out ohne weiteres möglich.
In der Lobby des Hotels gab es am Wochenende einen Club, der mit sehr schicken jungen Leuten gefüllt war. Ich bezweifle das dies ein angesagter Club ist, aber dort konnten meine Arbeitskollegen und ich noch einen netten Absacker in einer coolen Location am letzten Abend zu uns nehmen.
Dennoch gibt es negative Aspekte:
Die Fenster liessen sich in meinem Zimmer nicht richtig schliessen, was nicht weiter schlimm wäre, wenn mein Zimmer nicht zum Innenhof gelegen hätte, wo sich ein Restaurant mit Cocktailbar befindet. Diese lockte ziemlich viele Menschen an und spielte den ganzen Abend über Pop-Musik, so dass der Lärmpegel zwar nicht katastrophal, aber dennoch vorhanden war in meinem Raum. Die Musik hörte meistens gegen Mitternacht auf. Die Kissen und Decken sind amerikanischer Standard und somit unbequem und ungemütlich. Ich habe aber seltenst Hotels in Amerika gehabt, die von diesem Standard abwichen - Von daher kann man nicht wirklich über einen negativen Aspekt reden.
Abschliessend kann ich trotz der negativen Aspekte immer noch mit gutem Gewissen jedem, der das nötige Kleingeld vorweisen kann, dieses Hotel, aufgrund seiner Lage und dem ""modernen New Yorker Flair"", nur ans Herz legen.",Rocky_BalBOLA,2010-08-01,223023,2010-09-10,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

Alla fine una persona in un hotel deve dormirci e dormirci BENE!!!
Le camere sono piccole (e con piccole intendo minuscole), arredate in maniera molto spartana, non pulitissime, personale molto altanelante nell'erogazione di un ""buon servizio"", niente minibar (quello ce l'hai a gettoni in ogni piano) e soprattutto mi ha dato l'impressione di un posto che, oramai, va avanti sul nome che si è fatto begli anni.
Non ha manutenzione indi , a mio avviso, da evitare.

Servicepersonal freundlich aber nicht aufdringlich. Frühstück klasse, für amerikanische Verhälntisse auch ganz ordentlicher Kaffee. Die Zimmer sind wirklich klein, das hat man aber in NYC öfter. Man sollte nicht viel Gepäck dabei haben. Zimmerpreise wie in ganz NYC relativ hoch, würde aber trotzdem weiterempfehlen.

"“più un locale trendy che hotel” Siamo stati 5 notti all'Hudson e devo dire che la hall, i bar e le zone comuni sono davvero bellissime e d'effetto. I bar sono molto frequentati dai newyorkesi e spesso ci sono feste alla moda. Per chi come noi fa più che altro vita diurna in vacanza non è forse l'ideale, sebbene non ci siamo trovati male. Le stanze sono piccolissime e i pezzi di design di Starck sono pochi e non rappresentano un di più.

"“se bello vuoi apparire... qualcosa devi soffrire!” Io e mio marito siamo stati 2 volte in questo hotel, la prima nel 2006 e poi nel 2008 perchè a seguito del primo soggiorno ci era arrivata un'offerta di upgrade gratuito della stanza per un soggiorno futuro, quindi poi abbiamo avuto una superior al costo di una standard. Prenotando con expedia la prima volta avevamo la colazione a buffet inclusa, splendidi muffin, spremute e frutta freschissima, la seconda volta non era inclusa perciò abbiamo optato per il chioschetto con buonissimi cannoli siciliani lì fuori su Columbus Circle angolo Central Park, perchè 45 dollari per il buffet sono più ragionevoli forse per una colazione all'americana con uova, affettati.. insomma per chi pranza a colazione, anzichè per un caffè e brioche. Riguardo l'hotel sicuramente si paga il design ""alternativo"" a discapito delle comodità di una bella camera: bagno minimalista con un mini lavabo e un WC striminzito (mi domando se i tanti obesi americani non ci rimangano incastrati) in compenso bella la doccia col vetro trasparente che dà sulla camera (quindi si spera che dall'altra parte ci sia il proprio compagno/a sennò chiunque altro vi vede come mamma vi ha fatti) memorabili i set da bagno al rosmarino della AVEDA. Riguardo la camera vera e propria è praticamente un letto con 20cm di pavimento che gli girano intorno, le valigie le puoi aprire solo sul letto. In compenso come testata hai un pezzo di Manhattan incorniciato: c'è infatti un bel finestrone a vetro con vista (nel nostro caso) sulla 58a, perennemente incasinata. La mattina mi sono sempre svegliata prestissimo grazie ai pompieri che scorribandano e strombazzano perennemente. Credo quindi che i vetri non siano il massimo dell'insonorizzazione. Con la camera superior è andata leggermente meglio nel senso che la stanza si allunga un po' per contenere un disimpegno con mini divanetto e mini scrivania. Quindi se siete meno per l'apparenza e più per la sostanza, non prenotate qua! In compenso gli spazi comuni sono molto ampi e anch'essi particolari, la lobby col tetto in finta edera, il terrazzo con enormi vasoni, il solarium al piano alto, il lobby bar che è un posto trendy e gettonato di Manhattan dove tirar tardi. La biblioteca e la sala colazione con soffitti enormi e arredate con grandeur. L'effetto semi-buio della lobby già sottolineato è reale, mentre sinceramente ora non ricordo problematiche legate alla mancanza di pulizia. Le foto che qui sono state pubblicate rendono appieno le dimensioni degli ambienti e le carateristiche dell'hotel. Dimenticavo: fuori dall'hotel non ci sono insegne, ci sono solo dei bei giovanotti presi come dalle sfilate di Calvin Klein con auricolare che vi chiamano i taxi. Si accede alla lobby tramite una scala mobile con luci al neon giallolimone. Abbiamo speso 350 dollari a notte..... Nello stesso soggiorno abbiamo fatto un tour delle citttà dell'est e poi siamo tornati a NY perchè da qui avevamo l'aereo per il ritorno, l'ultima notte a NY l'abbiamo fatta all'hotel Doubletree che avevamo preso anche a Boston, l'hotel è sicuramente più tradizionale e meno pretenzioso ma le camere sono il doppio alla metà del prezzo. In sostanza chi vuole togliersi lo sfizio di vedere l'Hudson può sicuramente venirci a prendere un aperitivo, o farci un giro per gli spazi comuni, ma può risparmiarsi di prenotarci una camera!",rambina79,2008-12-01,223023,2010-06-07,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.9,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Perfektes Hotel für einen NEW YORK Trip” Wir verbrachten im April 2009 7 Tage im Hudson Hotel in New York City. Es liegt in einer Seitenstraße nähe Columbus Circle ( ca. 1 Gehminute). Die Lage ist wirklich perfekt, nur wenige Schritte zur Subway, zum Central Park, Time Warner Center mit zahlreichen Einkaufsmöglichkeiten uns super Aussicht, dem Appel Store, der 5th Avenue und auch in Gehweite des Times Square (wer gut zu Fuß ist- wer nicht nimmt Subway oder eines der zahlreichen Taxi´s oder Rigscha´s).
Unser Zimmer war für New Yorker Verhältnisse in Ordnung. Man kann in einer Stadt wie New York einfach nicht erwarten eine 35qm Suite zu einem vernünftigen Preis zu erhalten. Neben dem Bett stand eine kleiner Schreibtisch zur Verfügung und es war noch genügend Platz für die Koffer vorhanden. Den Schrank haben wir kaum benutzt, wäre aber möglich gewesen. Einzig im Bad wurde es zu zweit eng, dafür ist es aber mit einer Badewanne ausgestattet. Unser Zimmer wurde täglich gereinigt. Wir hatten nur die Übernachtung gebucht, dies war kein Problem, denn keine 10 Meter neben dem Hotel befindet sich die Europan Bakery, dort bekommt man ein wunderbares Frühstück, dass wir uns auch oft mit aufs Hotelzimmer genommen haben.
Zum Hotel selbst: es ist ein echtes Designstück, den Rezeptionsbereich erreicht man über ein Rollband, die Empfangshalle ist von einem riesigen Efeu überwachsen und bei schönem Wetter gibt es einen Garten der herrlich dekoriert zum entspannen unter freiem Himmel einlädt! Die Cocktails sind sehr empfehlenswert! Ebenfalls bei schönem Wetter geöffnet ist die Dachterasse des Hudson Hotel. Auch diese ist traumhaft dekoriert und lädt zum entspannen ein mit Hängematten, Liegen und Sofa´s.
Im Hotel ist auch eine Bar/Discothek, deshalb kann es im Rezeptionsbereich schon mal etwas laut sein, wir haben aber im fünften Stock immer herrlich geschlummert und nichts davon gehört. Das Personal im Hotel war jederzeit freundlich und hilfsbereit.
Für einen New York Besuch ist das Hotel wirklich bestens geeignet, denn es ist in Großstädten nie leicht schöne Hotels (und dieses ist vom Stil her wirklich einzigartig) mit so einer perfekten Lage zu einem erschwinglichen Preis zu finden. Einziger Wermutstropfen: bei den Hotelgängen ist es wohl mit dem Designer durchgegangen, diese sind sehr dunkel und grau gestrichen, nicht jedermanns Geschmack, aber mal ehrlich: wieviel Zeit verbringt man im Hotel Gang?

Nonostante la camera fosse al 23° piano, arrivavano perfettamente tutti i rumori del traffico (finestre non insonorizzate).
La colazione a buffet, compresa nel prezzo, era veramente ottima.
Lo staff è stato molto gentile e pronto nelle richieste.

Lo bueno: excelente ubicación a dos cuadras de colombus circus, habitaciones muy limpias y con todo lo necesario, es un hotel para gente jóven muy ""trendy"". Lo malo: respecto a la vez pasada, noté que faltaba un poco de cuidado en algunos detalles, los cojines del restaurante estaban un poco sucios, la calefacción hacía muchisimo ruido así que debíamos apagarla en la noche para poder dormir.

"“Vorteil ist die gute Lage, Service ist sehr schlecht. Wer sich für Design interessiert, dem genügt der Besuch der Lobby.” Wir waren im Oktober 2009 zu viert für ca. eine Woche im Hudson und das Hotel hat uns Viel-Reiseerprobten gar nicht überzeugt. Die Angestellten am Empfang sind äußerst arrogant und lassen einen - je nach Ankunftszeit - eine ganze Weile zum Check in ohne eine Begrüßung warten. Dann wurde auf unseren Kreditkarten eine Sicherheit gefordert, die höher als die Summe der gesamten Rechnung war. Normal sind ca. 10%. Das allerdings nicht gleich am Anfang, sondern wir wurden in der Woche gleich 3x an die Rezeption gerufen, um ""nachzusichern"". Das sollte man auf jeden Fall vorher wissen, falls man ein Limit auf seinen Karten hat. Außerdem waren die ZImmer so klein, dass man das normale Doppelzimmer wirklich nur als Paar ertragen konnte, die auf Kuschelkurs sind und keine Einkäufe tätigen. Wir haben nach einer Nacht das Zimmer gewechselt (upgrade), in dem dann auch noch die Heizung kaputt war und der Hausservice es nicht geregelt bekommen hat, dass Problem innerhalb 24 Stunden zu lösen bzw. uns auch nicht Bescheid zu geben, dass es in der Zeit nich lösbar wäre. Also sind wir dann nach der 2. Nacht ohne erholsamen Schlaf wieder umgezogen. Das Frühstück ist äußerst teuer und nicht im Paket enthalten. Dafür gibt es aber in der Umgebung viele nette und preisgünstige Alternativen. Die Dachterrasse ist an manchen Abenden aus nicht offensichtlichen Gründen geschlossen gewesen, ohne dass die Angestellten einen Grund nennen konnten (wollte?). Die Kakerlake, die wir dann noch am Tag vor unsere Heimreise in einen der beiden Zimmer eingefangen haben und an der Rezeption abgegeben haben, war Ihnen noch nicht einmal eine Entschuldigung wert. Sie wurde ohne eine Bemerkung unter dem Tresen in den Papierkorb entsorgt. Die Abrechnung wurde am Ende dann doch von der falschen Kreditkarte abgebucht, obwohl wir mehrmals darauf hingewiesen haben. Das Rezeptionspersonal ist jung und hip, aber überwiegend unerfahren, arrogant bis inkompetent. Vorteil des Hotels ist die wirklich sehr gute Lage und die Lobby im Design von Phillip Stark. Ein Blick lohnt sich auch ohne Übernachtung. Um einen Cocktail zu bekommen, benötigt man aber recht viel Zeit und Geduld. Fazit: Nur zu empfehlen für Leute, die kein Limit auf ihrer Kreditkarte haben, sich die großen Zimmer/Suiten leisten können, denen das Verhalten von Angestellten egal ist, viel Zeit zum Warten haben und die grundsätzlich irgendwo ausserhalb des Hotels essen/trinken gehen. Es gibt genug bessere Alternativen in Manhatten, wir werden nicht wieder zurückkommen.",Spontanurlauberin,2009-10-01,223023,2010-02-03,False,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.1,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street
"“Ottima posizione a Manhattan” Ho letto molte recensioni negative e perciò non mi aspettavo molto. In realtà, non posso che ritenermi molto soddisfatta del soggiorno all'Hudson. Ho prenotato un pacchetto volo+hotel ad un prezzo ragionevole per il periodo di Natale e non pensavo che mi avrebbero assegnato una camera all'ultimo piano con una splendida vista sulla città! 
Le camere, è vero, non sono il massimo in termini di grandezza; tuttavia, se si è a NY per piacere, il tempo che si passa in albergo non è poi molto e per quel poco che sono stata in stanza non mi posso lamentare. Probabilmente l'hotel è meno adatto per le persone non propriamente giovani, che possono avere esigenze diverse, in termini di spazio e location. Il personale è molto disponibile e celere nel rispondere alle esigenze dei clienti. La posizione è perfetta: la fermata della metro, che è in pratica di fronte all'ingresso dell'hotel, è attraversata da più linee che consentono di arrivare ovunque. Cosa da non sottovalutare: non si è nel mezzo del caos di Times Square, ma volendo la si raggiunge a piedi in massimo un quarto d'ora. Inoltre le principali attrazioni sono tutte in zona. Per concludere, direi che il rating globale del sito è un po' ingeneroso nei confronti di questa struttura, che mi sento di consigliare.",NEWYORKKKKKKKKK,2009-12-01,223023,2010-01-23,False,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Es más una discoteca que un hotel” El Hudson es un hotel de diseño con una de las discotecas más famosas de NY. Si buscas dormir en una discoteca este es tu sitio, si buscar otra cosa, es mejor que elijas otro hotel a pesar de su diseño y ubicación. Parece que tienen más interés en cuidar del negocio de la discoteca que del negocio del hotel. El personal no es amable y nos ayudó muy poco con todas nuestras cuestiones. Hay colas interminables para hacer el check-in y check-out. La limpieza de las habitaciones es deficiente. Además son muy oscuras y no están bien iluminadas. Probamos la standard room, la deluxe room y la studio. Contratamos una deluxe. Llegamos y no tenían preparada nuestra habitación. Tuvimos que esperar más de dos horas para finalmente darnos una deluxe con un ruido tremendo. Parecía que había un tren dentro de la habitación. Nos quejamos del ruido y nos cambiaron a una standard porque decían que no tenían otra superior. La diferencia entre una standard y una deluxe es simplemente el tamaño de la cama (queen en la standar y king en la deluxe) pero las habitaciones siguien siendo igual de pequeñas. Casi no merece la pena la diferencia. Las camas son muy bajas, casi a ras del suelo, puede ser bonito en cuanto a diseño pero muy incómodo en el día a día. La habitación estudio es un poco más grande, con un sillón pequeño pero aún así sigue siendo bastante reducida la habitación y no compensa calidad-precio. En la concergerie no nos ayudaron en absoluto en la recomendación de restaurantes y fueron realmente antipáticos. No se corresponde con la amabilidad americana típica del país y que encontramos en todas partes. No nos sentimos cómodos en ningún momento en el hotel.

"“Design vs Funktionalität” Ich war mit meiner Mutter im Oktober für 5 Nächte im Hudson Hotel. Das Hotel liegt recht zentral zwischen Met und Times Square am Columbus Circle.
Wer pauschal bucht, sollte darauf achten, dass man nicht mit seiner Mutter unter einer Bettdecke schlafen muss.

Nach einem 60$ Upgrade (+ Tax) hatten wir dann ein erträgliches Zimmer, welches allerdings wegen der Umstellung auf Winterheizung so überheizt war (ca. 26° C), dass man es kaum aushalten konnte. Auf Nachfrage an der Rezeption - für die es sich empfiehlt eine Taschenlampe mitzunehmen, weil sie so dunkel ist - erntet man überfordertes Personal welches sich freundlich entschuldigt, aber nicht für Abhilfe sorgen kann. 
Schön wenn das Zimmer Designer-Möbel hat und das Hotel 4 Sterne. Eine vernünftige Unterbringung sieht allerdings anders aus. New York war toll - das Hotel führte einen aber eher dazu länger durch New York zu wandeln und nur möglichst kurz im Hotel - wenn man das so will, dann ist es das Richtige.

"“Un loculo molto stiloso!!” L'hotel è in una posizione davvero ottimale a due passi dalla metro di Columbus Circle. Gli ambienti sono di design ed è tutto molto ""stiloso"" (soprattutto l hall, il giradino e la terrazza, l'unico neo sono le camere con delle dimensioni indecenti. Noi, in viaggio di nozze per 3 settimane in giro negli usa, avevamo 2 valige grandi e 2 trolley e le dovevamo scavalcare ogni volta perché non sapevamo dove metterle. Il bagno ancora peggio.
Noi l'avevamo prenotato sui Quickbook.com con un'offerta davvero conveniente, ma se fosse stato da pagare a prezzo pieno sarebbe stata una fregatura.
Di notte poi l'hotel si trasforma in un locale notturno, con musica a tutto volume, aperto anche agli esterni. La cosa però a noi non ha dato fastidio perché dalla nostra camera non si sentiva niente.
Alla reception ragazzi giovani e gentili, ma un po' ""distratti"": per avere delle pile nuove nel telecomando ho dovuto aspettare 2 giorni, quando ho deciso di lasciare un biglietto in camera alla cameriera....

"“Hotel moderno a 5 mns de Columbus Circle” Para mi primera visita a NYC y al estar solo 4 noches, quería un hotel agradable donde poder descansar tranquilamente por la noche.
Me sorprendio mucho el acceso a la recepción a través de una escalera mecánica con paredes de metacrilato de color verde fluorescente. De repente se desemboca en una recepción algo oscura llena de hiedra por las paredes y una imensa lampara-araña de cristal.
Las habitaciones son MUY pequeñas pero acojedoras, modernas, limpias y con el espacio muy aprovechado. Apenas hay medio medio al rededor de la cama pero tambien tiene una mesita-despacho, armario suficiente, 1 caja fuerte, 1 mini cadena y una mesa de planchar + plancha. La cama y las almohadas son muy comodas y en mi habitación apenas note el ruido de esta ciudad que no descansa nunca.
El baño es también muy estrecho pero tiene un pequeño plus: las muestras (shampoo, acondicionador, leche corporal y jabón) son de Korres.
Faltaria un mini bar pero en cada planta hay maquina de comida, bebida y hielo.
No pude probar el restaurante ya que estaba cerrado. El bar se llena y se anima mucho el fin de semana. De hecho siempre se ve gente purulando por abajo.
Fueron todos muy serviables y me dejaron mi habitación sin problemas hasta las 14h cuando se debe dejar a las 12h.
Columbus Circle y su parada de metro esta a 5mns con una linea que cruza todo Manhattan. Hay un centro comercial en el edificio Warner Time con un cafetería-super de comida a peso con gran selecciones de ensaladas y comida caliente. Permite comer bien y barato. Time Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue estan a unos 30 mns caminando.
Desde luego de 249-289 Dolares la noche + tazas me pareció caro, sobre todo por el poco espacio (pero siempre se dice que el espacio y los hoteles en NYC son caros) y más de lo que quería haber gastado pero estuve encantada con mi estancia y me senti más glamourosa por unos días :-)",Cariniu,2009-11-01,223023,2009-11-17,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Design ,comfort e ottima posizione” Ho prenotato una stanza tipologia Studio (cara ma ne vale la pena) in questo albergo per un soggiorno di 4 giorni nella grande mela. Mi sono trovato veramente bene in questo hotel per la posizione ottima e per il confort della stanza e la pulizia ineccepibile. Avevo letto nel sito delle stanze minuscole ecco perché ho optato per una stanza Studio di grande dimensioni con un bagno veramente ampio. Il personale è gentile anche se la hall soprattutto di sera è invasa da gente e musica alta proveniente dal bar dell’hotel frequentato da tantissimi ragazzi come punto mondano nella night life newyorkese. Guardate le foto dell’hotel perché non esiste insegna esterna e se arrivate in taxi spesso gli autisti non lo conoscono. La colazione è di ottimo livello ad un prezzo elevato ma consono alla qualità dei piatti serviti nella bella terrazza o nell’originale sala interna. Da sconsigliare lo Sky bar del 16 piano dove oltre a drink carissimi i bicchieri sono di plastica e non accompagnati da stuzzichini o patatine.

"“Concierge!!!!!” L'albergo è stupendo!!!Gli arredi, le terrazze con vista su New York sono studiati nei minimi dettagli, la pulizia perfetta. Certo le camere sono microscopiche, noi avevamo una deluxe ed era piccola, ma l'Hudson è situato a New York City dove non c'è albergo in cui le camere siano grandi (tranne le suite, ovvio!). 
La posizione è strategica: vicinissimo a Central Park e vicino alla metropolitana (nel caso servisse...); si arriva a piedi anche al Mandarin Hotel, perfetto per un aperitivo con vista.
Il punto forte dell'albergo è il servizio di conciergerie: a parte la pazienza nel soddisfare qualsiasi richiesta i concierge sono afferrati su ogni tipo di ristorante e locale (spesso per diretta esperienze), inoltre riescono a prenotare anche in ristoranti o locali spesso inacessibili per l'uomo comune! 
Non è un albergo a buon mercato, ma vale il prezzo e per una volta ogni tanto che si vola a N.Y.C. ci si può anche trattare bene!
L'unica cosa è che a noi avevano passato il conto finale degli extra (il giorno in cui siamo partite) sotto la porta, la mattina; ecco, non è esattamente quello che ci si aspetterebbe da un Hotel di questa categoria...Ad ogni modo è una piccola pecca che diventa nulla rispetto alla location, al servizio e all'interior design offerto dall'Hotel.",mocquee,2007-08-01,223023,2009-09-02,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Tolle Lage, aber ...” Wir waren bereits 2007 zu Gast im Hudson. Hier fanden wir nichts am Hotel auszusetzen und die Lage ist sowieso über alle Zweifel erhaben (<2 Blocks zum Central Park, Subway-Station ""Columbus Circle"" etwa 150m entfernt).
Dieses Jahr allerdings waren wir vom Hotel sehr enttäuscht.
Der neo-moderne Chic des Hotels beginnt etwas abzublättern, alles bis auf die tolle Hotel-Lobby hätte mal wieder eine Renovierung oder zumindest einen neuen Anstrich nötig. Der Service ist auch bei weitem nicht mehr auf dem Standard von 2007. Die Zahl der Servicemitarbeiter hat sich gefühlt auf die Hälfte reduziert.
Die Zimme sind sehr klein. NYC eben...
Das größte Ärgernis betraf unser Zimmer direkt. Beim Einchecken konnten wir uns zuerst über ein kostenloses Zimmer-Upgrade freuen. Allerdings stellte sich schon am ersten Tag heraus, dass die Klimaanlage nicht funktioniert, was bei ca. 30-35°C Außentemperarur sehr schlecht war. Nachdem wir das House-Keeping informiert hatten, wurde das Problem erstmal behoben tauchte allerdings am zweiten Tag wieder auf. So ging es bis zum vierten Tag weiter. Man war nicht fähig, eine defekte Sicherung zu wechseln. Am ärgerlichsten war allerdings die Tatsache, dass es immer mehrerer Anrufe bedurfte bzw. man persönlich am Front desk vorstellig werden musste, bis sich irgendjemand bequemte, hier etwas zu unternehmen...
Das ganze ist wahrscheinlich ein Einzelfall, allerdings darf es nicht sein, dass ein 4-Sterne-Haus, das sich noch dazu als ""trendy Hotel"" versteht, so eine Service-Wüste darstellt....",Captain_Porkenheimer,2009-06-01,223023,2009-07-19,False,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.9,0,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“miserabel” Erster Eindruck vom Hotel: da hat sich ein Designer völlig ausgetobt. Lautstärke der Musikbeschallung war wie in einer (Techno) Disco, und das tagsüber gegen 13Uhr.
Zweiter Eindruck - check-in: obwohl nur 1 Person vor mir war, dauerte es ewig, bestimmt 20 Minuten. Dann wollte das Hotel einen höheren Preis verlangen als den, den ich auf HRS gebucht hatte (unter der Bezeichnung ""confirmed rate"" verstehe ich dass der Preis fix ist so wie ich ihn gebucht habe, und nicht dass das Hotel versucht nachzuverhandeln...!). 
Dritter Eindruck: das Zimmer. total winzig, nur eine Mini-Kleiderstange, absolut null Stauraum für Kleidung und Gepäck. das Bad hat eine Grundfläche von 2qm und links und rechts vom Bett sind es weniger als 30cm bis zur Wand. Gesamt-Grundfläche des Raumes ca. 12qm. Kosten pro Nacht: $220. Da drängt sich die Frage auf: Wieviel ist das pro qm....? Man fühlt sich wie in einem Sarg.
Vierter Eindruck: nachts. Klimaanlage funktioniert nicht (überhaupt nicht). 12qm, 2 Personen => die Temperatur steigt auf gefühlte 30°. Die Fenster kann man NICHT öffnen. ich bekomme klaustrophobische Zustände.
Fünfter Eindruck: beim Concierge/an der Rezeption - wir beschweren uns über die nicht-funktionierende Klima-Anlage. Man sagt uns, dass wir unsere Sachen packen sollen und später ein anderes Zimmer bekommen. Wir mussten dann alles unten bei der Gepäckaufbewahrung abgeben (wieder Schlange stehen) und nachmittags als wir zurückkamen sollten wir ein anderes Zimmer bekommen. und was passiert? das Hotel wollte uns doch glatt exakt das selbe Zimmer wieder geben - in dem die Klimaanlage nach wie vor nicht funktioniert. Also, wieder runter zu Rezeption, diesmal laut geworden, anderes Zimmer bekommen. Genauso klein, aber immerhin ohne Erstickungszustände da dieses Mal die Klimaanlage funktioniert.
ich weiß, daß Hotelzimmer in NY fast immer sehr klein sind, aber das hier ist jenseits von Gut und Böse. 
Zu guter letzt: beim Check out wurde nochmals versucht einen anderen viel höheren Preis in Rechnung zu stellen- nochmals 1 Stunde Diskussionen.
Fazit: ganz sicher nie wieder. Das mieseste was ich je in NY erlebt habe.

"“Très classe mais chambre ridiculement petite !” Pour une première fois à New-York j'ai voulu un hôtel extraordinaire. J'ai suivi les conseils du Guide du Routard où ils disaient ""si vous devait faire une folie à NYC c'est ici que vous devez loger! ""
Bon alors à l'époque j'avais pas beaucoup d'argent et passé une semaine dans cet hotel me revenait une petite fortune ! (1000€ je crois) mais bon cet hotel m'avait l'air d'être exceptionnel, alors j'ai reservé.
En arrivant, dejà première déception: la façade de l'hotel n'avait rien du blanc immaculé montré sur le site de l'hotel. Elle été presque grise, terne et sale.
par contre en arrivant en haut de l'escalator, le hall est tout simplement splendide !!! on se sentais privilégié et tout été magique et irreel avec cette superbe verrière! Mais bon.. nous n'allions pas dormir dans le hall et la suite été un peu plus triste.
En arrivant dans la chambre double standart: j'ai halluciné !
Des cabine de bateau !!!!! d'une largeur de 2 metres sur 4, il y avait juste la place pour le lit et rien d'autre !
sans fenetre qui donne sur l'exterieur (fentre impossible d'ouvrir qui donnait sur une cour sombre, presque noire ! )
Bien qu'elle soit très classe, j'ai été extrement déçu ! (surtout que c'était pour un cadeau avec mon amie)
D'accord l'hotel est bien situé et qu'il est design mais là vraiment c'était prendre des gens pour des crétins, ni plus ni moins !!!
L'hotel super classe, mais la chambre RIDICULE.
J'ai quand même passé un super séjour à NYC malgré cela, on s'est habitué à la taille de la chambre.

"“Déco superbe mais mieux vaut y aller prendre un verre” Grande fan des hotels design
 j'ai reussi à entrainer mon mari pour 3 nuits, aprés avoir passé le reveillon chez des amis à New york.

Il a un gabarit plutôt grand et en écartant les bras il avait l'impression de toucher les murs. 
La suite était mieux ,mais pas d'isolation: en mettant la main prés des fenêtres vous sentiez l'air glacé. La salle de bains des années 1930 à peine up date.
Pour conclure une experience trés décevant: passé l'exitation de la découverte de la déco de Stark, (le hall, le salon, et du bar). Allez y plutôt pour prendre un verre le soir ,car à part cela...

"“decisamente ""modaiolo""” Ho pernottato una settimana all'Hudson con mio marito.
All'arrivo non abbiamo trovato l'entrata dell'albergo. Non c'è l'entrata dell'albergo. Voglio dire l'insegna, la hall con il portiere che ti da le chiavi...meno male che avevo visto la foto su internet e ho riconosciuto il posto. Una volta entrati ci siamo trovati davanti una scala mobile. Siamo saliti. Finalmente la hall. Penombra, arredamento ultramoderno, un giardino interno dietro al bancone della reception...e tutti gli impiegati così belli!
Siamo saliti in camera con uno dei tanti ascensori: musica, pareti ricoperte di metallo, luci soffuse.
I corridoi sembrano quelli di un sottomarino. Il colore dominante è il grigio (scuro) e l'illuminazione praticamente non c'è. 
Aperta la porta della camera mio marito l'ha subito ribattezzata ""il loculo"". A parte la metratura la camera è accogliente ed elegante nella sua essenzialità. L'aria condizionata è proprio dietro alla testata del letto ed è parecchio rumorosa. Però vi posso assicurare che dopo una giornata newyorkese neanche un bombardamento vi potrà togiere il sonno! Il bagno è ""striminzito"" come la camera ma altrettanto elegante e funzionale.
Gli ambienti comuni sono assoluamente fantastici. C'è una terrazza con bar al 15° piano con panorama sull'Hudson river, un bel giardino dove si può fare colazione, una sala da pranzo che sembra uscita da uno dei nostri conventi medioevali, una biblioteca tutta ricoperta di legno con un bel biliardo e un bar con sala da ballo molto ""cool"". l'Hotel è molto frequentato dagli autoctoni. Tutte le sere il bar ed il giardino sono gremiti di gente. E' come nei film: tutti belli, eleganti, in piedi con il bicchiere in mano. 
E' decisamente l'albergo più modaiolo dove abbia mai pernottato. Per goderne a pieno avrei dovuto essere modaiola anch'io! Comunque è un esperienza da fare. Che fai, vai a New York e scegli un albergo come quello che hai sotto casa?
La posizione è buona. Columbus Circle con la metropolitana e il Time Warner (un centro commerciale dove c'è tutto compreso un supermercato Whole food dove puoi mangiare ottimamente spendendo poco fino alle 11 di sera) è a pochi minuti. In un quarto d'ora a piedi si arriva a Time Square. Il prezzo non è bassissimo ma accettabile. A me è decisamente piaciuto. L'Hudson hotel non è solo un posto dove dormire, è parte integrante del viaggio.

"“Nie wieder!” Ich hatte die Kritiken nicht gelesen, bevor ich dort war - im Nachinhein könnte ich mich dafür...... Also: das Design des Hotels ist schon außergewöhnlich, insbesondere, was die Lobby betrifft. Auch die Idee, die Zimmer wie eine Kabine auf einem Kreuzfahrtschiff aussehen zu lassen, ist nett. Das die Zimmer klein sind, erfährt man ja bereits bei der Buchung - und dieses Versprechen wird dann auch erfüllt.
Was man nicht erfährt: Im Standardzimmer bleibt praktisch kein Platz für mehr als ein Gepäckstück. Das Badezimmer hat eine Glaswand zum ""Schlafzimmer"", und ist von der Größe her sehr wohl mit einer Flugzeugtoilette zu vergleichen.
Das schlimmste war aber das selbst nach amerikanischen Verhältnissen miserabel abgedichtete Fenster. Der Verkehrslärm drang praktisch ungehindert ins Zimmer (5. Stock). Das gleiche gilt für einen im September noch angenehmen kühlen Luftzug. Im Winter soll es ja dort auch mal sehr kalt werden, die Gäste sind dann nur zu bedauern. Die Fenster waren auch in den Zimmern meiner Freunde im 7. bzw. 9. Stockwerk.

sono rimasto molto deluso dalla qualità dell'albergo.

"“Quelle Horreur ! N'y allez pas ! Faites nous confiance !!!” Ceci est un réel avis objectif d'un couple hyper déçu par cet épouvantable hôtel :
- Avec ma femme, nous avons fait un magnfique voyage de noce de 3 semaine aux Etats-Unis... et parmis la 10aine d'hôtel que nous avons pu visiter celui là est de loin le pire
- Premièrement la déco malgré le fait que ça soit du Starke y a rien d'exceptionnel... style épurée avec 3 ampoules au plafond... rien de génial... en plus on voit rien le soir...
- Deuxièmement les taille des chambres .... c'est juste un plaisanterie... 10m2 tout compris... c'est le seul hôtel où on peut se brosser les dents tout en faisant pipi et se lavant les pied.... personnellement je suis grand (1m90 et je ne pouvais pas m'assoir sur les toilette mes genoux touchaient le mur). 
- Troisièmement, alors que nous avions réservé 3 mois à l'avance, on nous avait placé au 4e étage.... merci le bruit ... avec ma femme on a pensé que la fenêtre était ouverte tellement on entendait tout 
- Quatrièmement, la climatisation !!! en Juillet il fait chaud à NY... la clim est obligatoire ... sauf quand elle fait un bruit de tondeuse à gazon.... c'est l'horreur....
- Cinquièmement , les placard... ben c'est simple y en a pas... on doit se contenter d'étagère minuscules... quand on part 3 semaine c'est hyper partique.... et vu la taille de la chambrette ... pas possible d'ouvrire la valise ... obligé de le faire sur le lit....
- Sixièmement ..... le lit.... fait pour des lilipucien.... 30 cm de jambe qui dépasse (j'exagère un tout petit peu)
- Septièmement... la conciergeire... pas sympa du tout... et nous avons voulu voir le concert de Georges Michael.... ils ont fait payer 200 usd un ticket qui était estapillé USD 99.- -... avec le sourire bien sûr...
- Finalement... les petits déj... pas terrible et très cher...
Voilà j'aurai pu continuer... mais quand je lis les critiques des voyageurs qui ont adorés... je me dis qu'il doit surement avoir des agence de voyage dans le coup .... USD 250 par nuit pour ça... c'est une plaisanteire...

La ubicación es muy buena: está a una cuadra de Columbus Circle y el Metro, a dos de Broadway Ave, muy cerca de todo.

"“Très agréable, très bien situé : nous y retournerons avec plaisir.” Pour commencer, l'hotel est vraiment très beau : design et en même temps plein de charme. Le personnel est très présent et très poli. Nous devions séjourner dans 1 chambre standard mais quand l'hôtesse a vu que nous restions 8 jours, elle nous a octroyé une plus grande chambre sans surplus tarifaire.

Elles devaient nous être livrées dans les 24 h suivant notre arrivée soit vers 16h. Plusieurs fois pendant ce laps de temps nous avons demandé à l'accueil et aux concierges si elles étaient arrivées ! MAIS SELON LEUR SYSTÈME INFORMATIQUE : RIEN!!!

Ansonsten ist das Hotel very stylish und ultracool. Nach ein paar Tagen allerdings nervt die höhlenartige Beleuchtung. Wunderschön ist der Dachgarten mit Bar im 15.

Fuimos de viaje de novios. El precio era razonable.

"“Un hotel diferente... nuestro hotel en New York” Hemos estado ya en 2 ocasiones en este hotel. Estuvimos en diciembre de 2005 y en diciembre de 2007 y las 2 veces hemos quedado encantados.
Es un hotel diferente, sobre todo por el ambiente que se respira nada más entras allí. Es un hotel moderno en la decoración y en el ambiente: música ambiente, personal, clientela...
La atención es buena, aunque el personal un poco seco en mi opinión. Pero siempre intentaron atender nuestras peticiones en la medida en que les fue posible dadas las fechas en que estuvimos allí (plenas navidades) con mucha gente. Los botones de la puerta que también se encargan de los taxis también son muy eficientes y muy atentos con los clientes.
Las habitaciones: se habla mucho de lo pequeñas que son... y es cierto, muchas habitaciones son minúsculas. Pero también hay habitaciones de diferentes tamaños y si uno no quiere estar en una habitación que es el mínimo espacio puede reservar una un poco más grande... o mucho más grande. Eso sí, con un coste que irá subiendo cuanto más grande sea la habitación. Si reservas una con 2 camas separadas te aseguras que la habitación será espaciosa.
Si vas a hacer turismo y vas a estar todo el día por Manhattan, la habitación pequeña es suficiente siempre que no seas una persona muy alta o muy grande.
Tened en cuenta que los espacios son muy reducidos, pero suficiente para moverse el poco tiempo que estarás allí. El baño también es muy pequeño, al igual que el espacio para dejar la maleta y colgar la ropa. Pero con un poco de organización, acabas encontrando espacio para cada cosa (es como el tetris: vas encajando piezas y de este modo no sabéis la cantidad de cosas que podéis meter en esa mini habitación!!).
Lo que más nos gusta, a parte del ambiente moderno del hotel es que todo está muy limpio.
La cama es comodísima.
La tele es poca cosa y un poco vieja para la imagen que da el hotel de modernidad. Pero bueno, es sólo un detalle y tampoco se ve mucho la tele si vas de turismo a NY.
Las bebidas del bar del hotel también son muy buenas... aunque los precios un poco elevados, pero vale la pena entrar a tomar algo aunque sea 1 noche, sobre todo por la decoración del local.
En resumen: alojarse en este hotel es una experiencia más de tu viaje a New York.

Cet hotel, idélament situé répond à tous mes critères de choix.
Si vous cherchez autre chose qu'une chaine aseptisée d'hotel dans lesquel vous êtes à Paris comme à Moscou dans les mêmes conditions, le Hudson est unique.
Et pour aller à New York autant le faire dans un hotel en harmonie avec la ville. Si les chambres sont un peu petite (rappelons que nous sommes à New York), l'hotel est exceptionnel. A pied, vous pouvez, vous promenez dans central park,descendre Broadway pour aller à une comédie musicale, ou vous rejoindre la 5eme Avenue en 5 minutes.

Mais cette modernité ne se traduit pas par un lieu froid au contraire, le Hudson est un lieu de rencontre et de rendez-vous des New Yorkais qui viennent y boire un verre.

"“Kleine Zimmer, tolle Dachterrasse, gute Lage” Ich habe das Hotel über Priceline für 190 $ erhalten in einer Zeit, wo ähnliche Häuser ca 300$ verlangten.
Ich liebe designte Boutiquehotels, insofern war das Hudson genau das Richtige.
Über die viel zu kleinen Standardzimmer wurde hier schon viel absolut Zutreffendes geschrieben, so dass ich das nicht auch noch ausführlich behandeln werde. Wer Zimmer mit Platz braucht, muss woanders wohnen!
Das Hotel besticht durch seine Originalität in der gesamten Ausstattung der öffentlichen Bereiche wie auch der Zimmer sowie durch seine tolle Dachterrasse. Diese steht Hotelgästen offen; allerdings darf man keine Getränke oder Lebensmittel mitbringen. Es gibt jedoch einen Barservice dort oben.
Der Innenhof mit Restaurant, Bar und Aufenthaltsbereich ist ebenfalls sehr schön und ansprechend. Die Lobby sowie die Hotelflure sind nur mäßig beleuchtet, was ich etwas lächerlich fand. Wozu diese dustere Stimmung? Soll das modern sein oder über Mangel an Deko-Ideen hinweg täuschen?
Ansonsten war alles sehr sauber und das Personal zuvorkommend.
Das Hotel liegt in der 58th Straße in Fußnähe zum Time Warner Building am Columbus Cirlce mit seinem riesigen Whole Foods Supermarkt und dem Subway-Zugang.
Central Park wie Times Square sind um die Ecke. Die Lage ist exzellent.

"“Plus d'1,75m, s'abstenir !” Commençons par le positif. L'hôtel est très bien situé, juste à côté de central park et de colombus circle(pratique pour le métro), les chambres sont correctes (grand placard qui permet de ranger les valises ce qui est bien pratique vu la taille des chambres) et les prix plutôt intéressants pour New York. Les moins : hall très sombre et bruyant (ambiance très abercrombie comme signalé dans un précédent commentaire), salles de bain vraiment minuscules, l'espace entre les toilettes et la douche était des plus réduits. Je ne sais pas comment on peut se débrouiller quand on est grand. Les voituriers sont en général plus intéressés par leurs discussions que par l'arrivée d'un client. Nous avons eu un souci de réservation. L'hôtel ne nous retrouvait plus alors que l'agence avait bien eu confirmation. Tout s'est arrangé mais il a fallu insister. La réceptionniste a fini par nous surclasser , cependant, vu la taille de la chambre, j'ai eu des doutes... Y a-t'il plus petit ? Apparemment oui ! Je pense qu'il faut donc éviter la chambre de base.

"“Stylisches Hotel mit winzigen Zimmern und genialer Lage” Geschmäcker sind verschieden, aber es gibt einige Dinge im Hudson, über die man nicht geteilter Meinung sein kann. Die Größe der Standard Zimmer sind gelinde gesprochen winzig und wir mussten tatsächlich lachen als wir unsere Kajüte, denn grösser ist das Zimmer nicht, betreten haben. Besser noch ist das Standard Bett. Die Beziehung oder Ehe sollte in Takt sein, den viel Spielraum zum drehen oder wenden gibt es keinen. Mit zwei Erwachsenen Personen und zwei dazu passenden Koffern ist das Zimmer voll! Kein Scherz. 
Ich muss so bemitleidenswert geguckt haben, als ich am Frontdesk die Frage stellte, ob sie sich über die Größe der Zimmer im Klaren wären, dass wir nach einigem Hin und her ein kostenlosen Mega-Upgrade erhalten haben. Wir sind in einer Suite gelandet, die traumhaft schön war und in etwa der Grösse eines normalen Hotelzimmers entsprach. An dieser Stelle darf man den Staff des Hotels für ihre Hilfsbereitschaft besonders loben, denn wir mussten für das Upgrade keinen Cent bezahlen.
Die Lage des Hotels ist das eigentliche Plus, denn alles was man in New York so sehen sollte, kann man zu Fuß erreichen, oder aber die nahe gelegene U-Bahn Station nutzen. Die diversen Bars des Hotels sind immer noch hip und angesagt und am Wochenende brummt es dort gewaltig. Die Dachterrasse ist wunderschön und wohl auch einzigartig für New York. Ideal zum ausspannen nach einem anstrengenden Tag. Wer zentral unterkommen will und ein stylisches Hotel und Ambiente der Zimmergrösse vorzieht, ist hier bestens aufgehoben. Liebhaber grosser Hotelzimmer werden hier ihren ganz persönlichen Albtraum erleben.

"“Hôtel très chic et très bien situé” J'ai réservé cet hôtel sous la forme d'un ""package"" très bon marché, et force m'est de reconnaître que j'en ai eu pour mon argent : l'hôtel, designé par Philippe Starck, est assez impressionnant au niveau architectural (même si on se croit parfois plus dans une boîte de nuit que dans un hôtel) et bénéficie d'une situation idéale, à deux pas de Central Park et de la 5ème avenue. Les chambres sont assez belles et bien tenues, avec un lit confortable, mais très exigües (en particulier la salle de bain/toilettes, où il ne fait pas bon être trop gros ou trop grand...). Le soir, le bar (aux tarifs quelque peu exorbitants) se transforme en night club chic où le tout New-York défile pour venir danser ou boire un verre : on aime ou on n'aime pas, mais cela n'empêche pas d'être au calme dans sa chambre.

Volvió a estropearse la calefacción... En cuatro días, nunca nos hicieron la habitación: había que avisar en recepción para que el servicio se ""activase""... Ni una sincera disculpa por parte del personal ""fashion - cool"" de recepción.
Ni se le ocurra ir si mide más de 1,80 m.: en la cama cabrá muy justo y al baño tendrá que entrar de costado.

"“Una atracción más de Nueva York” Hemos ido a Nueva York este febrero del 2007 con mi pareja y el hotel ha estado a la altura de esta extraordinaria e impresionante ciudad. Es un hotel diferente, cuidado al mínimo detalle y nos resultó una atracción más de Nueva York. Es de un estilo medio Kisch que juega mucho con las luces y la decoración. Además en todo el hotel simpre te acompaña una agradabel música chill-out y de ambiente que le da un toque especial.
 Nos atendieron bastante bien y tienen un servicio bastante completo de reservas para cualquier evento. La habitación era pequeña pero muy acogedora y completa; tienen hasta equipo de música!
 Evidentemente estaba todo muy límpio y es un hotel bastante céntrico y cercano a cualquier transporte público.
 Finalmente deciros que es un hotel con muchísima marcha, ya que tiene un pub-discoteca chulísimo y del mismo estilo que todo el hotel, que se llena todos los dias con jovenes ""neoyorkinos"" bastante ""pijitos"". Pero no os precoupeis si quereis descansar, todo está perfectamente insonorizado y hay seguridada en los ascensores para que ningún descarriado, que no sea del hotel, se pueda colar a las habitaciones.
 No es un hotel barato, pero a nosotros, gracias a una oferta de última hora que nos regalaron la cuarta noche, no nos salió muy caro, por eso cuando volvamos a Nueva York, si lo permite nuestro bolsillo, seguro que repetimos en el mismo hotel.

"“New York's größter Darkroom” Das Hudson-Hotel ist die Neudefinition von Dienstleistungen der in dieser Preiskategorie geltenden Erwartungen hinsichtlich Komfort und Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis. Auf gut Englisch bezeichnet man das als Reframing. Wenn Kunden bereit sind, dafür zu bezahlen, sollten sie sie wissen, was sie erwartet. Hudson Hotel vermarktet - wie auf der Webseite erwähnt - ""Erlebnis und Design"" und nicht etwa die klassischen Tugenden eines Hotels. Diesem Ziel wird konsequent alles andere untergeordnet. Dabei bleiben leider auch einige Grundbedürfnisse des Gastes auf der Strecke.
Das ""Erlebnis"" beginnt bereits beim Einchecken in das namenlose Haus: aus Designgründen verzichtet dieses zum Hotel umfunktionierte ehemalige YMCA-Gebäude aus den 20er Jahren nämlich auf jegliche Namensnennung. Dass es sich beim (wohl ehemaligen Hinter-) Eingang (ein Loch in der Wand an der 58th Avenue West) um etwas besonderes und nicht um eine der anderen schmucklosen Türen der Appartement-Bauten direkt daneben handelt, verraten lediglich die vielen in schwarz gekleideten Leute von der Security davor. Man rennt buchstäblich erst einmal gegen die Wand, bevor man sich mühsam mit seinem Koffer durch eine der kleinen links und rechts davon und nach außen aufgehenden Glastüren durchdrängelt. Die Rolltreppe nach oben führt direkt in die angepriesene Designer-Efeu-umrankte Lobby. Oberhalb des Thresens dominiert ein riesiger Kronleuchter die Szene. Dessen Lampen sind keine Lampen, sondern auf Kartenhalter-Clips befestigte Hologramme. Leider kommt durch die schummrige Beleuchtung der beabsichtigte Effekt nicht so richtig zur Geltung: die virtuellen Lampen sind, genau wie der Rest des Gebäudes, unterbelichtet. Gleiches gilt für das Efeu: es entpuppt sich bei näherem Hinsehen, wie etliche der als Wandkaschierung angebrachten Rankgewächse auf der als ""Private Park"" bezeichneten Dachterasse, als billige Plastik-Imitation.
Apropos ""Private Park"": dabei handelt es sich um eine Dachterasse, die eingeklemmt zwischen den alten Backsteinmauern liegt. In Berlin wird so was als Innenhof bezeichnet. Sie ist umlärmt von mehreren hundert oberhalb angebrachten, antiquarischen Airco's. Dieses Airco-Grundrauschen, zusammen mit dem Strassenlärm von NYPD, Trucker-Horns, Taxi-Hupen und last not least die Berieselung durch die hauseigene Musikanlage, die diesen Grundlärm ja noch übertönen muß, lassen einen Snack oder Lunch an diesem Ort zum Härtetest der eigenen Stimmbänder werden. Endgültig verschlägt es einem die Sprache jedoch bei der Rechnung durch die hauseigene Gastronomie: Bier $ 9, eine 1l Flasche Wasser (Vasso, Glas, aus Norwegen, ohne Pfand und wegwerfen) $ 9.50 plus ein paar Appetizers der Karte lassen einen schnellen Snack, wenn man darauf wartet, dass die Zimmer endlich fertig sind, auf diesem Private Park mit 4 Personen schnell zum $175 Erlebnis werden. Kein Wunder also, wie wir während unseres Aufenthaltes erleben durften, dass es dem Gast strengstens untersagt ist - obwohl nirgendwo erwähnt - eigene Getränke wie einen angefangenen Becher Kaffee oder Speisen in Form einer Tüte Erdnüsse auf die hauseigene ""Sky Terrace"" im 15ten Stock mitzunehmen. Deren Genuss wird durch das gut geschulte und freundlich-zuvorkommende Personal sofort mit Androhung des Eingreifens durch die Security geahndet.
Thema Zimmer: keine Kritik über dieses Hotel in anderen Foren ohne Kommentar über die Zimmergröße. Ich kann nur sagen: selbst in jahrelangen Besuchen in Hotels in Japan, wo Platz bekanntlich Mangelware ist, ist mir ähnliches nicht widerfahren. Das auf der Webseite versprochene ""Erlebnis"" kann ich nur als klaustrophobisch bezeichnen: kein Platz für Koffer, das Bett so gross wie das Zimmer, der Fernseher dafür genau so klein. Die in das Zimmer integrierte Nasszelle (mit Fenster zum Bett) lässt sich am ehesten mit dem Standard französicher Ski-Resorts vergleichen: Zähneputzen, Morgengeschäft und Duschen kann alles auf einmal und zusammen erledigt werden.
Thema Nachtruhe: Well, the city never sleeps. Genau wie der Gast des Hudson. Der durchschnittliche Mitteleuropäer hat die Wahl zwischen folgenden Varianten von Schlaflosigkeit:
1. Mit Aircondition: der Kompressor direkt unter dem Fenster am Kopfende des Bettes lärmt mit dem Pegel eines durchnittlichen amerikanischen Highway-Trucks bei Vollgas, die Temperatur wird verglichen zur Aussentemperatur um ein Grad abgesenkt.
2. Ohne Aircondition, Fenster auf (soweit möglich, in meinem Zimmer nur ein paar Zentimeter): der Lärm der Kompressoren der anderen Airco's ist genau so laut wie 1, plus dem normalen New York Street Noise.
3. Abgesehen von 1. und 2: in der Disco in der Lobby Lounge-Musik an der Schmerzgrenze und mit 33% Klirrfaktor eine hoffnungslos überforderte Audio-Anlage.",dutchbert,2007-08-01,223023,2007-08-16,False,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1,4.0,Hudson New York,New York City,10019,356 West 58th Street

"“Sacré Philipe Starck !” J'ai reservé cet hotel sur directours.com. Super efficace et pro comme agence. 
J'ai été charmée par cet hotel dès que je suis descendue du taxi : la porte d'entrée est tres originale avec ses escalators jaunes ! . Le lobby est impressionnant. Le staff est jeune et tres sympa. C'est la plus grande reussite de starck. La chambre standard est miniscule et la Sbd aussi. Mais je voyageais tte seule donc ca allait. Le prix de l'hotel reste qd meme cher au vu de la taille de la chambre. Mais le fait d'etre dans cet hotel au moins une fois vaut le détour. Le restaurant est chaleureux, beau et le petit dej est impeccable (30us$ le buffet). La librairie est tres cosy et la décoration est super originale avec la collection de tableaux de vaches !. Les terrasses sont belles. Le lounge est magnifique. Le soir la lobby se transforme en lounge. Y a des agents de sécurité partout pour que les non residents ne montent pas dans les chambres.
C'est un hotel assez branché. A 1 bloc de central park. Le metro est au bout de la rue.
C'est super propre. Produits AVEDA offerts dans la SBD.

Auch zu Abend essen kann man im Hudson sehr gut, insbsondere wenn man nach einem langen Tag in der Stadt nicht mehr groß aus dem Haus möchte.

Very close to Central Park and some of the main shopping areas. There are a lot of nice breakfast places around, so that you don't have to take the quite expensive breakfast at the Hudson.

"“bella sopresa” Ho soggiornato all'Hudson dal 30 ottobre al 4 novembre, forse la settimana più affollata per Manhattan invasa da runners e maratoneti. Anche l'Hudson ne ha ospitati molti. L'albergo è molto fashion, quindi evitatelo se cercate sistemazioni tradizionale. Fashion significa che: 1)la struttura nell'insieme è straordinaria, dalla hall fino alla library per non parlare delle terrazze 2)chiassoso ma divertente: la sera è una specie di locale pubblico molto selezionato per newyorkesi doc, bella gente, giovani, musica a palla 3)Ristoranti interni sono da evitare: belli, hi tech ma costosi e la qualità del cibo è così-così 4)Camere: drammaticamente piccole anche se c'è tutto e gli spazi sono usati in modo intelligente. Consiglio: portare valigie piccole perchè o ci stanno loro o ci state voi 5) Pulizia: ottima. Ogni tanto però si rompe la finestra ed entra qualche spiffero. 6) Servizi in camera: ci sono tutti ma sono cari 7) Internet: devi pagare, dieci dollari al giorno, nel paese dove anche i caffè sono wireless.... 8)Collocazione: 58 esima strada tra la ottava e la nona. Dal mio punto di vista eccezionale, a due passi dal parco, dalla metropolitana, dai cinema di Lincoln center. Alla Quinta arrivi in quindici minuti a piedi. Lo stesso vale per theatre district.
