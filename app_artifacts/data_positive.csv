"“disappointing stay” 1) Did not stand by price confirmed online registration
2) the night i checked in thursday 12/14/12. The manager on duty was extremely rude and disrespectful
3) upon check out when again questioned the price discrepancy of what I had in hand confirmation and what was charged I was unable to get a reasonable explanation they ignored me had me wait for15minutes and no manager came to me I had to leave to attend my forum.
4) I will not return nor reccommend the New Yorker to anyone

"“A great place to stay in New York.” Just back from a great experience in NYC. 
The hotel is perfect for a city break. Clean, perfect location and the staff is second to none. It is most friendly and welcoming especially Angel the receptionist who searched and ensured we got the best rooms possible. Thank you. 
All other staff couldn't do enough for us. Well impressed. This includes the diner attached again with fab staff and very decent food. 
In short, for a very enjoyable stay in NYC this hotel is highly recommended.",teearr,2012-12-01,122005,2012-12-18,True,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Room has a Safe and HD TV” Room was small, the queen sized bed just fitted, however we knew about the small rooms from Tripadvisor photo's.
We planned just to sleep the nights anyway, going out during the day...which we did !
Our room had a Digital lock safe and HD TV, room was clean and tidy and the staff friendly. We checked in on a Thursday about 10:30pm which was quick no queue.
Made a mistake the first morning of entering Tic-Toc Dinner via the street entrance, the queue was massive waited about 15 mins and gave up and went across the road to Macs, we should have used the internal hotel entrance which we did the next day we got seated instantly, the street entrance had the same long queue. 
Hotel is a 5 minute walk to Macy's and 15 mins to Times Sq, And Empire State Building.",vic_fernandes7,2012-12-01,122005,2012-12-18,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Rat hole in a great location” The location is great - walking distance to the Times Square and to other tourists attractions. 
The room was just terrible - small, dirty, I think it was room 201 or something like that and it was located sort of between floors. I think that maybe other rooms in this hotel are better...
The staff were good though. I arrived early morning and receptionist let me check in right away with no extra charge. The breakfast was included which is nice also.
So it all depends on what you want - we left the room early morning and come back sometimes after middle night. The room didn't look inviting but we didn't care. The location was the most important thing for us.",krosh2002,2012-11-01,122005,2012-12-17,False,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“LOVELY VISIT” My mother and I were exhausted when we arrived and Mohammed at reception went out of his way to make us feel welcome. That was much appreciated. Our room was lovely with very comfortable beds.
The location was perfect and we were able to get to all the places we anted to see very easily.
It felt like home every time we came back to the New Yorker and we would definitely stay there again. We visited shortly before Christmas and the lobby looked so festive!
The Tic Tock Diner and the Bar served up great food.
Many thanks.",GASGODDESS,2012-12-01,122005,2012-12-17,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Lovely hotel in a great location” We arrived on 02/11/12 just after Hurricane Sandy. We stayed for 5 nights to take in my daughter's 21st birthday. We had requested a high level room with a good view, but because of the hurricane a lot of people had not checked out so one was not ready on our arrival. However, we were told that if we would like to leave our bags with the bellboy and perhaps have something to eat and a look round they would be able to get us a room in a couple of hours. We decided to do this which on reflection was a good thing as we went to Times Square, had something to eat and to the Rockerfeller and stayed out for 4 hours. Had we have gone straight to our room we would probably have rested for a while. When we did return my daughter was given a box of chocolates for her birthday and we got a room on the 32nd floor and the view from our window was the Empire State Building which was only one block away. The room was lovely, clean and comfortable. The attached diner was very good. We found the staff very polite and helpful. If we ever go to New York again we would definitely stay in this hotel.",LesleyandSarah,2012-11-01,122005,2012-12-17,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“40th birthday treat” The new yorker was a superb base for exploring new york right by the subway and walking distance to times Sq and the empire state building. Our room was very small and I was disappointed not to be offered any upgrade when checking in particularly when the travel agent had made a specific note on our booking so they would know in advance it was my birthday however we spent very little time in the room anyway. This was probably the best holiday I've ever had the sights you've seen in films its hard to believe you're looking at them for real!! I would recommend this hotel and also the tick rock diner brilliant for breakfast. Would also say go and see wicked was amazing,mandy72r,2012-12-01,122005,2012-12-17,True,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Location is Perfect” Just returned from a great stay in this fantastic city, stayed at the New Yorker Hotel which is located perfectly for all the major sites.The hotel is huge, very well run and very clean throughout.The rooms, although small, offer all you need and again kept very clean.Stayed on the 36th floor, and my one minor negative comment is that you still hear road and city noise (the double Glazing isnt upto much) but somehow it added to the feel of the city and didnt disturb at night.All in all a great place to stay, 2 mins walk from Penn station and the subway, 10 mns to Macy's and 15 mins to the Empire state, with times square a steady 20 mins away.
Adjoining Tic Toc diner ok for breakfast, and Coopers Tavern is a very nice relaxing bar.Hotel staff arranged transport to the airport,cheaper than the internet offers and with an extreemly proffesional curtious driver.Fully reccomend this hotel.",Spiremickey,2012-12-01,122005,2012-12-17,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“No worries for the New Yorker” My husband and I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel 27 - 30 November 2012.
The location was perfection! Penn Street station directly around the corner, Madison Square Gardens directly within eye site - just across the road.
The lobby was impressive - old New Yorker Charm, busy bustling lobby you'd expect of a New York hotel but with a much more welcoming vibe. We requested a room on a high floor and furtherest away from the elevator and the New Yorker Hotel delivered. 
Whilst cosy, the bed was comfy, the room was the perfect temperature, we didn't have much traffic noise and the bathroom had a bath!!!! It was lovely to soak into a warm bubble bath after a long day walking around and exploring the city.
We had a great view of the Empire State Building, it was fantastic to watch the lights twinkle at night as we were winding down getting ready for bed.
Loved every minute of our stay at the New Yorker and would highly recommend.",hailsntwang,2012-11-01,122005,2012-12-13,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Fabulous!” We have stayed at the New Yorker a few times in the last couple of years. The first time we had a perfect view of the Empire State Building through our window & it was the first thing we saw upon waking. The second time we had a double double suite as we took our sons & that was huge, v spacious and comfortable. The third time we had 2 rooms as we also took our daughter-in-law. Again, we were extremely happy. This time it was back to being just the 2 of us. We booked a metro room and Patricia in reservations was very helpful (as always) in her emails to us. She reserved us exactly what we asked for. Upon check-in, Mohammed was so very attentive, courteous & fun & said that a little work was being done outside our room window & so he changed our room (as we were returning guests & he could see that we had been in email communication with Patricia) to a bigger, corner room. He gave me both keys so I could see for myself and choose. The upgraded room was huge, lots of closet storage, big bathroom & great view. Wow!!! We felt very special. The staff went out of their way to be accommodating. The bellman made sure we had a big enough (& comfy) ride to the airport as we had several cases. (Too much shopping again!) The town cars & drivers provided are always courteous & helpful. The house keeping staff were friendly and the security guys always greet you & make you feel safe. The Tick Tock diner that is attached to the hotel is fab for 5am coffee & pastry (jetlag) or dinner. The location is perfect. Convenient, safe, easy for transportation etc. The New Yorker is not the cheapest & we do wish a breakfast was offered for all rooms, not just the suites but for comfort, safety, ease, a great feeling and a beautiful lobby you cannot beat it. We recommend 150%. Again, we want to thank Patricia for her help & reassurances over Superstorm Sandy damage and to commend Mohammed for excellent, second to none service.

"“Fab location!!!!!!!!” Our first trip to New York and we couldn't have stayed in a better located hotel for the price we paid!!!! 
45 min drive from the airport!!! If you aren't travelling in rush hour can be tubed at a third of the price!!! 
Excellent service as soon as we got there... We were told our room was quite small so the receptionist checked us into a bigger room with a view of the river! Nice modern room with everything you need for a base to explore, bathroom could be modernised but more than fine for the short time we were there! 
Located right opposite Madison square gardens ( you can't hear the concerts which depending could be a bad or good thing! ) Macy's is 5 minute walk and Empire State Building is 15 min walk! 
I would definitely recommend a metro card for a week at 29dollars! Even if you are only there for a few days works out cost effective to hop on and off!!! 
There's a bar and a diner located within the hotel which is fine for a quick drink/sandwich but everything you need is right outside the doors!!! 
Shopping tips!! Make sure room in your case!!! Century 21 department store great for bargains!! £350 handbags in the uk for £120 here!!!! Also when we were there Macy's had 25% off and as a visitor you could get another 5% off!!!
On leaving if you are taking a taxi get the doormen to get you a town car as cheaper than if the concierge in the hotel gets you one!!

"“Location,Location..with bad Attitude for free..............?” Just back from a Birthday celebration to this twenty four hour city,and following some positive reviews we decided to stay at the New Yorker hotel which is in a good position as previously noted for all the major sights and attractions of this wonderful city..
However, following along flight from Scotland, we were greeted upon arrival by the reception staff who were rude and off hand towards our enquires,and this I am sorry to say was the standard we encountered over our entire seven day stay, with a very poor rude attitude towards guests when ever we made even the most simplest of enquires, or requests.
Having previously visited various American cities in the last few years ,and stayed in a variety of standard of hotels while there, I can safely assure you that we have never encountered such a poor standard of customer service as encountered at the New Yorker on our recent trip. 
The hotel is not a four star,and more two, and is in urgent need of a refurbishment, with very small basic rooms that are not cleaned daily as previously mentioned by other reviewers , the only benefit of our trip was that we spent so much time out of the hotel taking in all the sights we 
had only to sleep in it at night.

"“Fun Dec weekend in NYC!” My friend and I took a trip to NYC to celebrate a great year and for a belated birthday celebration. We decided to splurge and stay at The New Yorker. 
Special call out to Angel, the guest services member who checked us in, was fantastic. His professionalism, friendliness and true dedication to first class service was apparent in all the details. He took extra steps to make sure we felt welcome and had the knowledge for an amazing weekend.
In addition to staying at The New Yorker, we enjoyed two shows - A Christmas Story (with a fantastic Italian dinner at Sofia's, right across from the Marriott in Times Square) and of course, the classic Phantom of the Opera. Before Phantom, we met up with some friends for dinner at Bobby' Flay's Bar Americain. Now THAT is an amazing dining experience - I highly recommend the steaks and my friend ordered a seafood dish with lobster, crab and mussels that was out of this world. The cheese plate is a great dessert and so is the Pistachio Creme Brulee.
Another special moment was on Saturday, Dec 8. It was the 32 anniversary of John Lennon's assassination. My friend and I went to Strawberry Fields and stood at the Imagine Mosaic. There was a singer that was a John Lennon look alike and sound alike. He and his band did a free concert as a tribute to John - it was pretty special. More than 150 people gathered in NYC Central Park at Strawberry Fields and filled the air with ""Imagine,"" ""Give Peace a Chance,"" ""All You Need is Love,"" and of course, the finale of ""Let It Be."" This is a precious memory in my life.

Service from staff was usually curt and basic rather than particularly friendly or helpful, but nothing really bad either.

The lobby was 5*. Wow! I figured this place was going to be fabulous.
The desk clerk was rude and surly. 
The room was terribly disappointing. It was tiny--which I would expect for NYC--but it was closer to a 2* room than 4*. Simply nothing attractive or upscale. No coffee or tea in the room. The bathroom was claustrophobic and had no place to put my toiletries.

"“Great location” We stayed here for 5 nights in a New Yorker suite sleeping 5 people. After a jumpy start we had a lovely stay. Upon check in the lady there wanted $24 extra plus taxes per night because there were 5 adults in our party. When I booked our room I liaised with the person who runs their facebook page and he told me when booking to input 4 people into the reservation page and I could put a comment on the reservation explaining that there were 5 people in our party and he said that the rooms were charged by night not by how many were in the party so there would be no charge. The lady named Ana just grunted when I explained this to her. We found her rude! Needless to say we did not pay extra. 
Our room was lovely and clean if a little small but thankfully had 2 bathrooms which was a godsend while trying to get ready each morning. We ate at the tick tock diner only once and found it nice.

"“Bad service and cramped room” Yes, this hotel has history. It shows, and not in a good way. The front desk was staffed with people that were less than friendly. The room, which was a ""view"" room was very small but without any European charm (where small is the norm). I had to request a refrigerator for storing medication. A maid wheeled it in a placed it in front of a small dresser (only place near a plug). It meant I could not get to one side of the bed or the small desk, without hopping over it. When I woke up in the morning after barely sleeping on the uncomfortable bed, I found my medication frozen which destroyed it. Not good.

"“Great Hotel NYC” The New Yorker Hotel is in a great location at 34th and 8th. The subway line is just outside the door. The Tic Toc Diner is open 24hr located in the lobby. The rooms are small, but very clean. I have always been allowed to check in early even when I arrive before 10am! Staff is friendly, cleaning staff do a great job. Security in lobby only allow guests to go upstairs if they have a room key which is a great plus. This is an older hotel refurbished in retro decor. The 1920's character of the building still shows. High speed elevators make for no wait to get up and down from guest rooms.

The interior is just gorgeous, the staff are friendly and helpful and on this note thanks for the upgrade from the 21st for 33rd floor where I went from a no view room which was small to a big room which offered me the Empire State Building as my main view :) though the bathrooms are dated they are very clean and the cleaner comes daily to replace any towels, toiletries etc! The hair dryer is provided and personally think it was good no need to bring your own and same for the iron and ironing board! The wifi is free and connects great in the rooms! The beds a very comfortable and the pillows- didn't want to leave them! There is heating Which was greatly needed in the minus temps!

"“Excellent” Myself, daughter and Mother-in-Law stayed here from 27th November-1st December. Recommended to us by the company I booked with, Dial-a-Flight and Kelly was fabulous. This was our first time in NYC and I was apprehensive. The hotel staff were excellent. Mohammed upgraded us to a room with a view on request. He offered us a larger room, no view or a room with 2 bathrooms, no view but we opted for the room with the Empire State as our view. The room wasn't large but good enough for us. Lovely, clean and tidy, maid service every day. No coffee and tea facilities and the TV was all to pay for but we didn't want it anyway. There were small toiletries which were replaced if used. A hairdryer, an iron, ironing board and a safe that was very easy to use.
We ate breakfast in the attached TickTock diner which was so great with excellent friendly staff.
All the staff in the hotel were extremely helpful, friendly and polite. Easy access to everywhere and a 10 min walk to the Empire State and Penn Station subway.

The most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in. The room was kept immaculately clean. The staff were pleasant and polite. We stayed from 22nd November to 26th November and celebrated my wife's 60th birthday in New York. We were on the 34th floor, which was serviced by 6 lifts. Never had a problem getting a lift. Found the bar staff rude. Tic Toc Diner good for breakfast,but wouldn't recommend it for evening meals. The hotel is in a good location within easy walking distance of Times Square and Macys. I recommend the Grayline 2 day bus pass which gives you the opportunity to see New York with an informative commentary by a tour guide. All in all an excellent holiday in New York, although we did feel $180 for a half hour yellow taxi ride back to Newark Airport in a standard yellow cab for 2, which was obtained by the doorman, extortionate!",Arbie52,2012-11-01,122005,2012-12-05,True,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

I gave MOHAMMED my reservation number and requested a roll away bed for my daughter. Mohammed typed on his computer and handed me a room key card. He told me he wanted my daughters first visit to NYC to be memorable. MOHAMMED had gone out of his way to upgrade our room!! We had 180 degree views!! The Hudson from one window and the city from another. MOHAMMED is a true asset to this Hotel and made this stay EXTRA special.

It is in a great location for getting anywhere in Manhattan, whether walking, taxi or subway.

If you stay here you have to have breakfast at the tick tock diner, just a true american diner. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a nice hotel in a central location... i would also take up the offer of arranging a transport shuttle from the hotel, we done this leaving the hotel and we saved $30 and they arrange everything.

"“Great for the Empire State Building.” I stayed in The New Yorker for a total of 6 nights, I had to extend my trip by 1 night due to my flight being cancelled and the staff were extremely helpful and managed to keep us in the same room for the final night.
From the word go the staff couldn't be more helpful, polite or nice.
The hotel is lovely and very busy! The only negative on the hotel I could probably mention is the plumbing is very noisy. The showers and toilets in the rooms next door to us woke us up an awful lot due to being so noisy. 
The location is great for attractions such as the Empire State Building or shopping in Macy*s. There are a lack of places to eat in this area compared to if you were to stay close to Little Italy for example. The hotel does have two restaurants inside it though, one is called Coopers Tavern which I never used because the menu didn't appeal to me or my family, the second is the Tick Tock Diner. I absolutely loved it in there. It's decorated as an old school diner which reminded me of the film Grease. The food wasn't spectacular but was good. We had one bad experience with a member of staff being rude and demanding her tip as we were unsure if when she gave our bill if she had included it, so we went to ask as the till if they could make sure it was included. Before we'd reached the till she had come up to us demanding that she needed it. All other members of staff were lovely though and incredibily helpful. They have great pancakes in this place too.
If I was to visit New York again, I'd try to stay somewhere closer to Time Square, however, with the transport links in New York it doesn't matter too much where you stay.

When I checked in, the staff gave me coupons (blue-colored) for free continental breakfast in a nearby restaurant Tick Tock Dinner. When I used the coupon in the morning, I just could not believe my eyes. The breakfast only includes one glass of juice, one cup of coffee, and two very small pieces of toast. It’s hardly enough for my three-year old son. The second morning I talked to the front desk staff. The guy was very rude. So I talked to the manager. She said she needs 30 minutes to find out what went wrong. I just don’t want to waste my time to wait for half an hour for this. I requested a refund. But she refused.

Great location in midtown near a shoppers mecca. The hotel itself is not too big, not too small, it's really just right. Many original art deco details are still visible here. Plenty of elevators, spacious lobby, perfect for people watching. 
The rooms are definately ""cozy"". But cozy is good, as long as it's clean. And my room was very clean. Comfy beds, fluffy yet squishy pillows. I also LOVED that the rooms have windows that open. I hate when I'm all sealed up in a hotel room. Great bathroom. Teeny tiny, great shower, plenty of hot water, and a superb bathtub. I took a bubble bath every night I was there!

However, after a chill-out in our 37th floor room which was perfectly adequate as a base for a couple of days before moving elsewhere for the rest of our holiday, a calmer version of me realised that unlike most of the USA inhabitants, many New Yorkers are abrupt and to the point and don't waste time with pleasantries. Other staff in the hotel were much nicer, especially the guys on the Transportation, information and assistance desks.

"“Really should not be rated four stars...” This is a great hotel if you want to be in the middle of tourist world. The vast majority of people lined up to check in (we checked in late afternoon and waited 20 minutes) were folks with online, bargain cut rates. 
The hotel was pleasant enough, just not up to the above average expected from a four star. The building has aged, and they clearly are trying to keep some of the aged charm (hardware around elevators, signs, etc) but it almost felt dated. Hard to describe, but some hotels pull the charm off with solid spit and polish, the New Yorker tries to do it more with a quick coat of paint. Once upstairs, the carpets are beat, wallpaper is kind of beat, etc. I guess the word would be worn.
The room was comfortable, although the mattress was less than supportive. I absolutely do not excuse bed linens, especially sheets, that are synthetic and scratchy, at best. For this rate and rating, I expect cotton or other natural fabric, and I expect it to be plush. The other issue was a bathroom without ventilation. While I get the age of the building, paint over tile, instead of a tile replacement, and a bathroom full of steam after a shower is again, short of four star expectations.
This hotel is perfect for a first or second tourist visit to Manahattan. Location is central, with an easy walk train, subway, Madison Square, Times Square, the Empire State Building.

"“Four Nights Post Sandy” We spent 4 nights and 5 days at the New Yorker two weeks after Sandy hammered the New York/New Jersey area. I must say I was dubious the quality of our experience in New York, but I was completely wrong. We were in New York to attend a theatrical group tour, and the show went on...with panache and elan. The New Yorker was very nice: Our room was a typical New York City hotel room-small by the standards of most other places-but nicely appointed. The staff of the hotel were all friendly and accomodating. The location is close to the Theater District, but not in the District. Be prepared to walk, which is part of the NYC lifestyle. It is incredibly close to Penn Station, so it is a good choice if you come by train from the south or west. We would stay here again if our plans were focused on Broadway.",Alan_and_Vera,2012-11-01,122005,2012-11-23,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Overpriced and poor service” Our family of 4 recently took one of our dream trips - New York City for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. We booked the New Yorker through Expedia. The reviews looked good, but we were very disappointed. At check-in, the hotel staff was disinterested at best, but truly rude. For the rest of our stay, the service from the concierge, front desk, and travel desk was simply awful. Despite our efforts to be polite, we were continually faced with rude employees who obviously were not interested in us. The cleaning staff, on the other hand, were friendly and accommodating. The room was unbearably small with a view of a wall, and the bathroom was worse. A tiny sink, no counter space and a barely functional shower. The location was decent, but not great. We were there for four nights and would not return. This is NOT a family-friendly hotel. On the upside, Cooper's Tavern in the lobby served an excellent, albeit expensive, Thanksgiving dinner.",TDeal4,2012-11-01,122005,2012-11-23,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.6,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Fantastic” My 2 sisters, my mother and I stayed here for the first time last week for 5 days. It was my mothers first visit to NYC, it was my and my sisters third time. We really wanted to make it a trip to remember for her. I had booked a room with two double beds and upon arrival was shocked at how small the room was, on the 29th floor. There was no room to walk around whatsoever and we had no room for our suitcases so much so my sister put hers up on the desk and planned to leave it there for the week.
After the first night of staying in that room I quickly realised we couldnt do another night, especially with my mother suffering from a chest infection, the room was far too stuffy and small for the four of us (2 to a bed).
The next morning I went down to reception and pleaded my case that my mother was sick and could we get a different (bigger) room.
Not only did we get another room, we were given a suite on the 39th floor!!! The suite was fantastic! My mother got a room to herself (the fold out couch in the living room) and my sisters and I shared the 2 double beds in the bedroom. I was not expecting that at all, I was just expecting a bigger version of the room we had been in. The hotel staff went above and beyond my expectations to ensure we had a very very comfortable stay for the duration of our holiday. We had much more room for our suitcases and bags upon bags of shopping, it was perfect and I would definetly recommend the suite should you plan a shopping trip for 4 people. DO NOT chance staying in a regular double bed X 2 room because the rooms are tiny!
Big shout out to the Front desk manager Birgid who was so nice and considerate to move us to a bigger and better room without any extra charge and thank you also to Gabina who assisted.
I will definetly return to stay in this hotel!
Also thank you to the man (didnt get his name) on the transportation desk in the hotel who got us a ride to the airport at such short notice (meant to be 24 hrs notice), he saved our behinds big time!!!",IrishCarol,2012-11-01,122005,2012-11-23,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Decent hotel in a great location” Stayed there for a week and it's a perfectly adequate hotel.

The rooms are small but completely adequate as you're likely to be out exploring New York most of the time. 
Minus one point for the rude night manager. We were charged for a movie we hadn't watched and he was immediately confrontational.

The building is spectacular, especially if you like Art Deco architecture. The location is also very convenient, it is a short walk to Times Square and to the Empire State Building.
Our room was quite large for a hotel room in Midtown Manhattan and surprisingly clean, however nothing really special. I guess it is not so easy to find a good value as this hotel in Manhattan.

A colleague stayed there as well and his room was tiny. I jokingly asked for the Presidential Suite and got a tiny bed room with a large sitting room and a tiny bathroom. 
The place smelled like an older aparatment house in NYC and the building was very tired.

It's beauty is that is is a short walk from Penn Station, and very convenient to everything. Oh, and it does not have room service, so if you plan to eat in your room you have to bring it in yourself, or order from one of the restaurants that delivers and meet them in the lobby to get it.

"“Great location, friendly and accommodating staff” I was here for 12 nights and the place grows on you.  At first all you notice is a very busy lobby and highly impersonal service.  But as you get to know people in reception or on your floor, you feel better about staying at this hotel
First the good:
 1. Location, location location.   It couldn’t be better. Just a few blocks from the Theater District you can easily walk to shows. Its only  a block to Macy’s.
 2. one entrance to the subway is on the same corner as the hotel so you can get anyplace in NYC very easily
 3. there are complimentary New York Times  and USA Today newspapers each morning at the information desk.  Get there early for  the NYT as they go fast
 4. when the hotel was rennovated (am guessing about 8 years ago), some walls were removed so SOME double rooms have two bathrooms and two closets.  
 5. complimentary in-room wi-fi  is fast and reliable. You have to re-register every 12 hours and you can upgrade to faster service ($9.95 a day), but I don’t think it is necessary for the casual user. No password is needed, though you do need it if you are using wi-fi in the lobby.
And the not-so-good
 1. New York hotels are expensive. If you book the cheapest room, you will get a teeny-tiny room with a view of a wall.   Spend the extra  for a  double/twin  room.   Some doubles are two rooms put together so  have two bathrooms and two closets.   Nice for women traveling together.
 2. there are no safes in the rooms, though they are available at reception.
 3. coffee makers are not standard in the rooms, but you can request one.
 4. five of the lower floors are student housing so there is always a lot of activity in the elevators.    Book a room on the 21st floor or above, and you will use separate, less congested elevators
An interesting aside is that the hotel is owned by the Unification Church (the moonies) and they are still the top administrators.  It is managed by  Ramada.",Esther P,2012-11-01,122005,2012-11-19,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good location, simple hotel but ticks all the boxes” We stayed in at The New Yorker at the end of October just when Hurricane Sandy hit the area. Needless to say our trip was somewhat disrupted. However, the staff at the New Yorker were helpful despite being up to their necks in work and hassled travellers. 
We had a room on the 19th floor, with two double beds. It was an excellent size and loads of storage. We requested a camp bed and they swiftly brought one to the room which my friend's daughter said was very comfy. The bathroom was dated, clean, but far from modern. Seems the rooms have been nicely updated , but the bathrooms haven't. Tiles have been painted over rather than replaced and fittings are old. 
This is a good hotel. It's location is excellent for all the immediate tourist attractions. The Tick Tock diner is ok for breakfast but not great for supper. 
The concierge department were excellent and more than happy to help arrange a shuttle bus to the airports, print off boarding passes etc.

"“Great location, friendly service” While it's certainly possible to find more personal, boutique-y neighbourhood hotels, the New Yorker trumps many on the basis of its combination of location and value for money. The NYer was one of the first monster hotels to be built in the city and is almost like a city in miniature itself. Back in the day, it hosted many of the big bands and sports stars of the time. On arrival, you may be shocked by the size of the lobby and the sheer number of people in it, but this level of busy-ness is really what being in Manhattan is all about! The first 20 floors are not for hotel guests, which means you're guaranteed a room some way off the ground. 
The NYer has been renovated several times over the years, retaining many of its Art Deco features, esp in the bathrooms. It could do with a bit more updating particularly in the public areas, but hopefully you will not be spending a great deal of time wandering the corridors, unless you get lost! The room we were given was a little small and the view not great, but the lady who checked us in said to come back the next day if we weren't happy. On doing so, she upgraded us to a much larger room at no additional charge, complete with a view of the Empire State building! That will do nicely NYer!
Apart from the friendly service, the location is the prime reason you would choose the NYer. In a safe neighbourhood and walking distance (and I mean walking distance) from the Empire State, Times Square, Macy's, Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden and other attractions, it's ideally located in Midtown West, with Penn Station subway just outside. There's also a reasonable 24 hour diner right next door - Tick Tock - great for breakfasts and late dinners.
Altogether, you can't go wrong with the Nyer - it provides an ideal base in this spectacular city...if possible give yourself 7 days here.",croydondweller,2012-10-01,122005,2012-11-18,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Amazing Location” Just back from New York having stayed at the New Yorker hotel for 4 nights, we requested a twin room and due to the hurrican I called the hotel to ensure all was ok - only to be informed that a standard ""double"" room was reservered. When asking what could be done, I was advised an upgrade to a view room that provided twin double beds would cost me 20 dollars a night plus taxes more - so as me and my mate were traveling I had no option but to accept. I over heard a conversation with 2 other guests who had also reverved a twin but were given a double - so maybe a call to the hotel the week before traveling is wise.
When you arrive at the hotel you realise just how ""BIG"" it is, but it give a much smaller feel when inside, the staff were wonderfully friendly and my only issue is check in queues, so my advice is do not try and check in before 4pm (between 3 - 4 the queue was a nightmare). One queued I was told my room was not ready and come back in 1 hour, no big issue had I not spend 20 mins in the queue. Killing time in the bat which provides happy hour most days and the food is ace - the skyscrap burger is well worth a try.
Once the hour had gone and so had the queue, Ruth on reception was lovely and even offered me a room change 1 day in to get a view of the Empire State building as the room I was given had panaramic view of the Hudson River. There is free safe hire so bear that in mind when checking in.
The room 3403 was large for a New York City hotel, with a walk in wardrobe and 2 good sized double beds and space tp walk about - better then most London hotels I have stayed in, Small table and an arm chair and tv stand with 2 windows and an amazing Hudson River view over to New Jersey. The bathroom was so clean and load of fresh towels and they are bath towels not sheets so people on here said they were small, well not they are bath towel sized.
The room had climate control and free wi-fi, smart HD flat screen tv and loads of channels to choose from. For breakfast the Tick Tock diner was amazing, always busy and the staff are so friendly and worth the tips I left every time I eat there.
My only gripe is once you check out - they will not allow you to use the hotel rest rooms, so my advice is just use the once in the bar (at the back - and are large is you need to get changed prior to leaving).
The location is amazing, there are subway enterances around the corner and Times Square and the Empire State building are only a few blocks away, Mace's is around the corner and everything else is either a short walk or subway away.
I would highty recommend this hotel to anyone - i noticed alot of negative comments about silly little things, but honestly just checkin after 4 and go for a view room its worth the extra (as a few said a standard room were a little on the small side).
I would use this hotel again the Art deco design and insides are magic - makes you want to go back in time to the 30's and see it in its original glory.",Tony E,2012-11-01,122005,2012-11-18,False,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Still an Excellent Old World/Old New York-Style Hotel in the Upper Chelsea/Garment District Area!” Before I start with my actual review for this fine hotel, I need to share with you a bit of a preface to the review.
I stayed at this hotel several times between 1997 and 2001 on visits to Manhattan, and I loved it each time. In fact, it became my favorite hotel in Manhattan. Then, starting around 2001, came a long haitus period during which I did not need to stay overnite in Manhattan for a number of years; this period lasted for over a decade. 
Now let's move forward about a decade, to late 2010, when I started to make trips several times per year to Manhattan because of my work, but for those stays, I needed to be positioned in lower SoHo, near Chinatown, and I rather quickly found a hotel in lower SoHo (the Holiday Inn SoHo) that more than met my needs, and that hotel has become, over the past two years, my favorite hotel for my fairly frequent stays in lower Manhattan. 
Well, I learned in early October 2012 that I needed to spend a few days on the west side of lower mid-town Manhattan, just above Chelsea in mid-November in order to see some clients in that area, and so I checked out room prices at the New Yorker hotel using their own website (I will note here that I tend to always reserve my hotel stays via a hotel's own website, rather than via any of the online booking services, because things always seem to turn out better that way). I checked the room rates with a bit of hesitation, simply because I had noticed that the New Yorker nightly room rates have climbed steadily over the past decade, and that many times nowadays their room rates fall in the range of about $380 to $700 per night, which is well out of my price range.
Well, I was very lucky when I checked room rates in early October for a projected stay in mid-November, for I was quickly able to book three nights at the New Yorker (from Nov. 17 to Nov. 19), via their own website, for an average per-night price of about $175. To me, that is very impressive!
Now that we have the introductory material out of the way, I can move on to my review for my current stay here. By the way, I am writing this review on Nov. 18th, during the middle of my 3-night stay at the New Yorker, and then on the 19th I will be moving on to SoHo (because of my work requirements), where I will stay for an additional two weeks at the earlier-mentioned hotel in lower SoHo.
In late morning on Friday, Nov. 16, as I was heading to Manhattan on an Amtrak train, I suddenly realized that while I would be getting to New Yorker hotel by around 1 PM (and, of course, their normal check-in time is 3 PM, typical for most hotels), I had totally forgotten to call the hotel front desk the night before -- as they had recommended that I do when I had called back in October to ask about the possibility of an early check-in -- to request an early check-in. 
In an attempt to remediate my oversight, I grabbed my cell phone and tried to call the front desk at the hotel in an effort to at least give them a bit of advance warning that I would be asking for an early check-in at about 1 PM. Well, each of my two consecutive attempts to call the front desk at the New Yorker resulted in a string of never-answered rings, followed by a recorded message telling me that the front desk staff was too busy to take my call, after which my call was rolled to voicemail. During my second attempt to call the hotel's front desk, I finally left a brief voicemail advising them that I would be arriving at the hotel in about one hour, at about 1 PM, and telling them that I would appreciate an early check-in if it was possible. 
Well, it was only a quick walk from Penn Station to the hotel once my train had arrived in Manhattan, and I found myself approaching the front desk even earlier than 1 PM, perhaps at about 12:45 PM, with the full realization that there was a very good chance that they might not be able to offer me an early check-in on such belated notice. However, I was about to be pleasantly surprised! 
Once I reached the front desk, I introduced myself, and asked for an early check-in, explaining that I had totally forgotten to call the night before to give them a heads-up about the request, and adding that I would be more than happy to pay any early check-in fees, if necessary, if they could accommodate my request for an early check-in. The very friendly front desk clerk quickly told me that she would indeed be able to check me in immediately, and she advised me that there would be no extra fees for the privilege of early check-in. 
I happened to mention during our conversation that I had stayed at the New Yorker several times in the past between 1997 and 2001, and it was about at this point that she offered me a free upgrade from the New Yorker Room (a relatively basic room with a queen bed located on the 19th floor or above) that I had reserved, to a View Room, which, she explained would give me a queen bed room on an even higher floor that offered a better view of the New York skyline, and would also offer me a little bit more floor space. Of course, I accepted her kind offer for a free upgrade.
I am now a full two days into my 3-night stay here at the New Yorker, and I can report that this hotel has lost none of its charm since my last stay here over a decade ago. There are tons of elevators -- specifically, six or seven elevators serving floors 2 through 20, and another six elevators serving floors 21 through 40 -- and the elevators are spacious and fast, and thus there is NEVER any significant wait for an elevator, no matter what time of day or night.
The lobby is still quite impressive; it is very large, and it features a number of separate seating areas where one can sit to wait, or relax, or read a book, or to simply sit and people-watch. There are currently two restaurants in the lobby; a cute art deco-style (like much of the rest of the hotel) diner-style restaurant called the TickTock Diner on the southern end of the lobby, and a restaurant called Coopers at the northern end of the lobby. I have eaten at both, and each has good menu selections and serves good food.
I have invariably found the lobby area, the large elevator area, the hallways (on the hotel room floors) and my room to be immaculately clean and well-cared for. Yes, the rooms are a bit small, but that is simply a fact of life for rooms in most hotels in Manhattan, at least in the under-$600-per-night price range, due to high real estate costs and high property taxes. 
Speaking of the rooms, the building was completed in 1926, and opened for business as a hotel in 1930, and thus the basic ""bones"" of the structure -- including room shape and size for the hotel rooms -- are the same as when the hotel was first built. With that in mind, I want to say that I feel that the hotel management has made excellent use of the available space and structural bones in remodeling the rooms and the hallways, and the net result, for me, is a hotel that is obviously almost one hundred years old, but which exhibits a lot of warmth and grace, and which remains an iconic and stately hotel, one of the grander old-style hotels in Manhattan.
During my stay here, I have always found the front desk staff to be very helfpul and attentive, whether I have approached them in person or whether I have called the front desk from my room phone. Regarding complaints from a few earlier reviewers that they were never able to reach the front desk by phone while they were staying in the hotel, and rather, that they got rolled to voicemail each time they had tried to call the front desk, here is my report of my own experience in that realm:
Much as I reported earlier, my two attempts to call the hotel's front desk from my cell phone while on a train enroute to Manhattan did result in each of my two calls having been rolled to voicemail. However, during my actual stay here, out of the eight or so times that I have needed to call the front desk, there has been only one instance where my attempt to do so has resulted in my call being rolled to voicemail, and, in that case, when I tried again to call the front desk just one minute later, my call was answered by a person almost immediately.
I was able to easily get a rental refrigerator for my room by calling the front desk, and the total one-time refrigerator rental fee was simply $20, which is a bargain by Manhattan hotel standards!
Since so many past reviewers have complained about the bathrooms, I will offer my own observations on that matter here: I am 6'1"" tall, albeit rather slender (I weigh about 185 pounds) and agile, and I never had any problems at all navigating around the room itself (even with the small rental refrigerator installed) or in the bathroom. 
Yes, the bathroom is rather small, but that is very common for hotel rooms in New York city, particularly in the older buildings, and, at least in my room (a View Room on the 28th floor), the bathroom was spotless and immaculate, and both the bathtub and the tile floors of the bathroom were in perfect shape. And, despite the fact that I am 6'1"" tall, I had no trouble at all accessing or using the sink, the shower/tub, or the toilet, and could easily live in this room for months on end in total physical comfort and ease, without ever feeling cramped, crowded or constrained by space limitations. 
All that I can say in closing is that whenever I need to stay in or near the Chelsea/Garment District area in Manhattan, I will definitely return to this hotel again and again.
BTW, while basic bare-bones slow WiFi here is free for all hotel guests, there is a charge of about $9 per day for a very high-speed enhanced WiFi connection (it is very quick and easy to enable the enhanced high-speed WiFi; it takes about four seconds to click on a button to have the charges billed to your room bill). I personally chose to go with the high-speed option, and I have not regretted it.
One last note: for me, one of the things that gave this hotel its charm was the old-style wooden door frames and moulding/trim, and the old marble trim that was ever-present in hallways, in the lobby and in the mezzanine area.",Vinny067,2012-11-01,122005,2012-11-18,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Adequate” There is a lot of history to to this hotel, and it tends to show in the wrong ways: old-style marble trim in rather drab hallways, for example. The rooms are tiny, i.e normal for New York, and the attempts at Art Deco styling are not very successful. A plus for me was the casement window, which opened. I prefer that to the hermetic HVAC systems of modern hotels. A minus was that there was almost no ledge, and no sink counter, in the bathroom. If you're mot careful, leaning over the sink to splash water on your face can lead to a bonk on the forehead from what ledge there is. 
Apparently certain floors of the building are residential or offices; the upper floors are hotel. It makes for a busy lobby, and annoying security near the elevators. The all-night old-fashioned diner, off the lobby, seems nice on paper but looked hideous from the doorway. The best thing about the hotel is its location a block from Penn Station, allowing for easy access to the subways and the train to Newark Airport.",loraxes,2012-10-01,122005,2012-11-17,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.1,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

It took three hours to eventually get changed to another room , they acknowledged this was still not the right room , the toilet was so small even our average sizes could sit there ...though the next night we were given a much better room which we loved.

"“Great Location, excellent Staff and Nice Hotel” I stayed at the New Yorker from the 09th - 12th November 2012. The hotel is a 20 min car journey from Newark Airport and a ten minutes walking distance from the Empire State Building, Macy's and Times Square. 
Upon arrival check in was quick and requests for coffee & tea making facilties for our group of six in each room was honoured. We also asked for a room upgrade for one of our of party as it was a special occasion. The room was upgraded to a larger room with a view of the Hudson plus a small box of chocolates were presented, a nice touch!
The rooms are small, to be expected as it is New York and space is a premium! However the rooms were clean, newly refurbished and the bed was very comfortable. My room upon entering had a strong smell of smoke. I reported this to reception who were surprised as it is a non smoking hotel. However they changed my room no questions asked and the next room was fine. 
Attached to the hotel is a small diner caled Tick Tock and we had breakfast there every morning. It was clean, the food was delicious and the staff excellent. It is very busy so try and turn up early in order to get a table. The concierge sorted out our New York Pass and assisted us with where to get tickets for the hop on and off buses that tour the city - a must to see everything! They also sorted out out thearte tickets. We saw Mamma Mia and the tickets start at around $140 -200. We booked our tickets and got them for $99 each, a bargin. The concierge - Susie was a lovely lady, very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. 
We organised an SUV to take us back to the airport and this was $145, so around $25 each. It was quick and easy to organise at the Transportation desk in the hotel and the driver was excellent. I had also organised a limo to pick us up at the airport which I had ordered from the hotel via email prior to our trip. They kept in contact prior to the flight and were waiting for us at the airport as we exited the arrival lounge. On our last day we placed our bags with the bell boys as we had chekced out of our rooms. For a couple of dollars they place them in a secure room which allowed us to go shopping without having to cart our luggage around. 
I cannot pick fault with the hotel or the experience we had during our stay. The the hotel is old and full of character. It is well maintained and the traditional art decor style is consistent throughout every floor. There is a gift shop downstairs and seemed competitive. Even though the rooms are small we spent so little time in them, all that mattered is that the bed was comfortable and it was!

"“A Historic New York Favorite” The New Yorker Hotel aka Ramada-Plaza, is part of the Wyndham chain.
I recently had the opportunity to stay at the historic New Yorker while attending a conference at the nearby Javits Convention Center. The New Yorker is very convenient to a number of attractions and venues in mid-town Manhattan, located as it is at 34th and 8th. Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Macy’s, Herald Square and the aforementioned Javits Center just to name a few. In addition, there are a plethora of nearby restaurants, easily 50+ places to eat within a two block radius around the hotel. These restaurants include the Tick Tock Diner and Cooper’s, both on the hotel grounds adjacent to the main lobby, as well as the Stage Door deli within less than a block. One of the main attractions of the New Yorker is simply its history, of which almost all the staff seem to be blissfully unaware, and the hotel misses the boat on an excellent marketing opportunity if they would include a short blurb in the in-room notebooks (sorry, English only despite English speakers being apparently a minority of the guests) or in a pamphlet available at the front desk. There’s a lot of history with the New Yorker, once one of the best hotels in Manhattan. Visitors can find a Wikipedia history entry at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Yorker_Hotel. The hotel was built in 1928 and interestingly among the many facts, it was the home of the genius Nikola Tesla for the last 10 years of his life, 1933 - 1943. He lived in Room 3327 and used adjacent 3328 as his study. Both rooms are still available for occupancy. The hotel is considered mid-level to be moderately priced by New York standards and is very comfortable, with large rooms, and an unfailingly friendly staff. Numerous renovations over the years have kept the hotel up to modern standards. A well-equipped fitness center is included for the athletic types, there’s free wi-fi (an absolute must in today’s world), and a small and well-equipped business center. I found The New Yorker a delight and despite modernization still has remnants of its past, art-deco glory.

We also had brunch the next day at the attached diner and all enjoyed our food. 
There was only one thing I wanted to mention. As a surprise, before we headed out to dinner, my husband had arranged for a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to be sent to the room. We were in the room for about two hours and nothing ever came (which I found out when I asked him about it the next day.) Since it was a surprise, we weren't expecting anything. At 2am, not long after we returned to the room, we received a phone call to see if we were in the room. Shortly, the champagne and strawberries appeared. Upon contacting my husband, I learned that he had sent them. The next morning we ate the soggy, chocolate covered strawberries and I brought the champagne home, appreciative of the thoughtful gesture.

"“Brilliant location, great food (in the restaurant - didn't try the Tic Toc diner - seemed a bit greasy for my liking)” We were checked in by Mohammad. He was very pleasant and gave us a SUPER room.

The windows were somewhat draughty but the heating prevented us from getting cold. The room was very clean and the ensuite was also clean but somewhat dated which made no difference to me. 
The hotel location is superb. We happily walked everywhere - Macy's is just 2 blocks away, we took a cab up to central park then walked back via 5th avenue. Walked from the theatre back in the evening - never once felt concerned for our safety. 
We booked the hotel transfer from JFK on arrival and it was FANTASTIC. we arrived in the middle of a snow storm and it was wonderful to find Boris at the baggage carosel waiting for us, ready to escort us straight across the road to the car - well well well worth doing!

"“It'll a Do...Good location” We visit NYC often but this was our first time staying a The New Yorker. Initially, we were pretty excited to stay at a somewhat historical hotel. Although the lobby is attractive with a nice retro feel, the quality of the rooms were a bit disappointing. The room seemed clean, and being NYC, the room size was not surprising to us. However, the bathroom was definitely in need of attention. It almost looked like the tiles in the shower/tub had been painted over and the door appeared warped as it was difficult to close. The shower head was unusually low - and I'm short. It also flowed a solid stream of water, like from a fire hose - not comfortable. However, this is New York, so realistically, how much time are you really spending in your room? If you're like us, you just need a clean bed and a place to shower. For that, it will do.

"“Nice building, good location, let down on service.” I was a little concerned as soon as I arrived at The New Yorker. It was raining, dark, I had a screaming baby in the back seat and really needed some help with our bags etc but couldn't seem to get anyone's attention, so not a great start.
No doubt it's an impressive building, and the 39th floor suite we had was well enough appointed, small for a suite but to be expected in NYC. My only real complaint with the room was that the windows are small, (as you would expect with the architecture of the era) & the net curtains they've hung don't slide back, So we ended up peering through the narrow slit that remains which was a shame from the 39th floor.
Location is spot on, near Maceys and the shopping district, everything within walking distance really. The park a little further away, perhaps half an hour. 
The service however wasn't really good enough. The hotel is huge and busy and the staff always tended to be a bit brusque and unhelpful. The hot water broke down one day, I called reception to ask when it would be fixed and the lady on reception was quite rude really. A couple of hours later the water came back on but was dark brown however long we let it run, I called reception again and same lady hardly let me get a word out before she put me through to what she said would be a manager but in fact was just an answer machine. The hotel did credit $50 on our bill when we left but to be honest, the water breaking down was probably a one off problem that could happen anywhere, it was the way it was dealt with that wasn't great.
One major tip I would give anyone staying at this hotel is not to use the Transport desk. We asked reception about booking a taxi/car service to take us to the airport when we checked out to save waiting for a taxi the early morning we were leaving. 
We were quickly ushered over to the transport desk where two quite stroppy guys told us it would be $135 for the larger vehicle we needed and then demanded we pay them there and then up front. It felt all wrong so I declined. My friend that lives in NYC then recommended a local car service Carmel who provided an equivalent size vehicle for $68 that we paid for on the day, half the price
Perhaps the hotel would have provided a posher car but then we never asked for that and as a tourist you rely hotels to give good advice and stop you getting ripped off. I feel like here the opposite happened and tourists that know no better end up overpaying.
Overall it's a great location & a huge iconic building but as such, I'm not sure the staff have quite the incentive to provide a decent level of service. It was an ok stay but I'll try somewhere else next time.",Goodbloke1,2012-10-01,122005,2012-11-11,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“A Very Decent Hotel, But the Value Depends on the Price!” My wife and I live in Manhattan, and we were forced to relocate 8 blocks west due to Hurricane Sandy. So, we stayed in The New Yorker for 4 nights. This is a huge hotel with old bones that clearly has been renovated, largely successfully so. The lobby is impressive, but the perhaps 40-minute check-in wait was not. (But, this was almost at the height of Hurricane Sandy, so I would definitely cut them some slack here.) Getting off the elevator onto our floor, we were faced with a very large vestibule that lead to the hallways to the rooms, and perhaps because the vestibule is so large, it gives the feeling that the ceiling is somewhat low (maybe it really is somewhat low?), so I would hardly call the experience an ""airy feeling."" Again, I believe the hotel management has done a lot to work with the old bones of the hotel. For example, also as you step off the elevator onto the room floors, you are also greeted with complimentary newspapers. Now to the room: Ours was rather small in size, but the room was modern (except for the closet). The bed? Wow! Remarkably comfortable. There was a nice flat screen tv. The bathroom was probably the low-point of the room. On the plus side, it was clean, the sink area modern, and very good lighting. The tub, however, was clearly dated (but, again clean), seemingly from the 1960s. It typically took 3 or 4 minutes before we could get hot water out of the shower (and this was not, in our experience, a fluke, namely, that held true for all the days we were there). The towels were thin and cheap, the bar of soap remarkably small and anorectic. There was very little space over the sink for toiletries. Room noise was problematic, on and off, until about 10PM: The walls are not very thick, and we could hear a baby crying and a dog barking next door. There was noteworthy stomping coming from the room above us, and similar loud sounds coming from the room next door (around 8:00 pm). My wife went next door, and it turns out it was housekeeping making up the room. Clearly, they clean up and make up the rooms at all hours (as they likely must do in such a large hotel). After 10PM, things were largely quiet, and we had no problems sleeping. So, in the final analysis: This is a centrally located, older but modernized, very clean hotel. The key issue is: Is it worth it for the money? We paid $249 (+ tax) for the first few nights and a ""special hurricane rate"" ($209 + tax) for the remaining nights. If you can get the room for that neck of the woods, I'd grab it. Ultimately, we had to live in a hotel for an additional 5 nights, and we ended up moving to the DoubleTree Times Square South (on 36th Street between 8th and 9th Avenue) -- a much nicer hotel that was less money (BUT, I think this was a fluke, namely, all the runners for the NYC Marathon had moved out of the DoubleTree after Mayor Bloomberg cancelled the race, so perhaps the DoubleTree markedly lowered their rate [to $199 + tax per night] for a very small window of opportunity in order to re-fill the hotel). See my review of the DoubleTree on tripadvisor also. If the rates for the 2 hotels are the same for you, don't think twice -- grab the DoubleTree!",Psychologyguy,2012-11-01,122005,2012-11-11,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Location + Fair Price = Good experience” Upon arrival I found the lobby clean and expansive. The check in is tucked away to the right of the main entrance making it difficult to find when standing in awe of simply being in New York (my first visit). I was directed by the concierge desk that I mistakenly approached on where to check in. The process was quick and efficient as with many transactions in the city. I received my keys and headed to the elevators. Be prepared to show your room key each time to head toward the elevators as an attendant is on duty to prevent random tourists from catching a ride up. I was on the 37th floor out of 42. The view was toward downtown and I could see the manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, the new tower, as well as lady liberty on a clear day. The room is very small as are many habitats in New York, yet is comfortable. It had a queen size, comfortable bed. Also a decent closet and dresser to unpack and settle in. I usually live out of my suitcase when I travel but found it necessary to unpack due to lack of space. The bathroom is functional with a pedestal sink, large deep tub, and less than desirable shower head. I traveled alone and felt the room was more than adequate for my needs. It's about a 10 min walk to Times Square or Chelsea neighborhood. Directly across the street is Penn Station and Madison Sq Garden.

"“Close to times sqaure...” I travelled to New York a few years ago, from what I gathered the hotel had just had a re vamp. A friend of mine stayed at the hotel previously and told me that it was rather outdated, but the tick tock diner is amazing. 
When arriving at the hotel, I was pleasently surprised, the lobby was huge and christmassy - just watch you expected for christmas in New York!
However. When we finally booked in and we were shown our rooms it was a different story. We have previously booked a room with two double beds for 14 nights. When we got into our room, we found one bed in a tiny room. So small you could not open the wardrobe doors and had to climb across the bed to get to the the wardrobe, and push the bed out the way.
The view we had was of a brick wall, but the toilet/ bathroom was pretty spacious and nice.
After a week of sharing a bed with my friend, with loud nosies of people next door, the window not opening when the heating had broken. The room was like a sauna and we were unable to open or window or shut off the heating in a small box room at around 3am. We were pretty exhausted and tired at this point with no sleep or relaxation whats so ever. 
The 7th night, we finally had enough, works from down the corridor began at 5am. We thought it was someone next door banging on the shower pipes, but when we went down after a restless sleep in a boiling room, no space and generelly annoyed we were upgraded to a room at the top of the hotel, after an explaination that it was work men completing works on the refurbishment.
The room we had made up for the whole holiday to be honest. It was massive. We have two huge beds each, a direct view of the empire state building, views over looking the streets of new york and a view of the chrysler building in the second window we had, at night time the lights of the empire state building would glow, it was a shame to close the windows.
However, apart from the 1st week in the hotel in the box room, I'd say this hotel is okay, however if you can get a room like we had on our second week, it will make your new york experiance much more better than our first week!
On our first night, we ate pancakes at the tick tock diner, after I had been advised that these are amazing. I'm not sure if it was the shock of the room we were given, shaken by the fact I had walked out of a dwane reed without my $90 change until a nice gentleman had ran out after me handing it to me, or general jet lag...but I really didn't think much to the pancakes. My friend who was with me had ordered an ice tea and had recieved a cold glass of water with floating tea leaves in, which could have been an ice coffee or ice tea with a split bag? I'm not sure. 
The staff at the hotel were helpful, and advised us on how to contact home and where to get phone cards from. Apart from that there wasn't much interaction with the staff, I think because the hotel is so big it's pretty hard to remember everyones name and make the stay a little bit personal.",nomnom7,2011-12-01,122005,2012-11-11,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.1,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Average Hotel at Premium Price” While it is historically a luxury hotel, I would rank it as pretty average by modern standards. It is dated, but clean and well kept.

“A good NYC hotel” From the outside the Hotel looks impressive that 1920s Neo-Gothic look is very NYC. On the inside the hotel has obviously been refurbished and whilst we checked in the day after Hurricane Sandy everything seemed to be going smoothly. The lady that checked us in immediately upgraded us to a slightly larger room. Which we were grateful for as the upgraded room was still frightfully small with a smallish bed something between a double and queen sized. Fortunately we were able to upgrade again for an extra $10 a night which gave us two beds of that size in much larger room. It was definately worth the $10. There is free wifi and it is across the road from Penn Station and Madision Square Garden. They have a tours and booking service in the lobby and the lady there was able to arrange tickets to Book or Mormons for me with 36 hours notice. The hotel is an easy walk to the theatres and plenty of restaurants around. I would happily stay here again in the future.,Mng75,2012-11-01,122005,2012-11-10,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Consistent experience in great location” I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past 30 years. The location just can't be beat and the experience is consistently good.

"“Sure, it has its charms, but don't expect much.” Don't be fooled by the pretty pictures of the lobby... this place is OLD. That could be cool - I love historical buildings with beautiful architecture and a fascinating backstory. However, this hotel is just not ""up to snuff"" to be considered a top stay in NYC. The staff do their best, and there were definitely some friendly faces around the hotel during my 5-night stay, but the customer service cannot make up for the old building. (Upon arrival, Mohammed did make sure to find me a room with two double beds, which was much appreciated.) The bathroom took me back decades - the plumbing was not great and the shower head was from another era (hint: not the future). There is little insulation, and you can hear conversations in the hallway at all hours, and doors slamming. It sounded like there were people in my room sometimes. Oh, and the wifi hardly ever works. You'd have to pay $10/day for the high speed wifi if you need internet access. Good points: The room itself was small but completely fine, and the beds were comfortable. Despite the size of the hotel, I was never waiting long for an elevator; I think there are 6 or 7 for each side of the hotel. There's a 24-hr Duane Reade across the street. That can be a life saver. The location itself is fairly handy, especially for shopping and access to Broadway. The 24-hr diner is handy too, for late night munchies and morning breakfast. The food isn't fantastic but it'll do when there's nothing else around. There are subway stops nearby that give you access to most of the main lines up and down Manhattan. The neighborhood itself is not that charming, though. Next visit, I will definitely try to stay at a boutique hotel in a less bustling part of the city.",wanderluststruck,2012-10-01,122005,2012-12-01,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Book and pay for your show tickets online from the theater,you can print them off at home and just show them at the box office when you go this will save you a lot of time queueing for ages trying to get cheap tickets with not good seats.
Be prepared to tip a lot,the whole place relies on them,you usualy get a choice of between,15,18 or 20% on top of the bill.Three of us where there for 5 days and we tipped around 150d in various places, but hey if your going NYC you´ll be taking a few bob anyway.If you rearly want to see as much as possible then do as much walking as you can,tour busses are OK but you need to be on the ground to take it all in.

"“What a great stay” Due to Superstorm Sandy we had to move hotel a number of times to secure accomodation for each night our delayed stay. From the 3 hotels we stayed at the New Yorker was by far the best, though reading other comments we may have struck lucky. Situated on the 35th floor one of our rooms had a view of the Empire State Builiding to die for and the other room had 3 windows, 2 facing the Hudson river. The location was very good but as our 4 day stay in New York had been extended to 10 days we'd become used to walking everywhere, so no doubt our fitness levels had increased.
The staff we met were friendly including reception, transportation, and bell boys. Can only recommend this hotel based on our experience.

The Tick Tock diner is excellent and we ate breakfast there early every morning. The staff there were really great. Coopers Tavern, the other on site restaurant is also excellent and we ate supper there 2 nights in a row. We had a double/double room on the 34th floor with a view of the Empire State building. The room was of a good size but the bathroom was a bit snug. No problem for us though at all. The Reception staff were all excellent and helpful and there is a great handy shop in the basement of the hotel again with lovely staff.

"“Loved it” Booked The New Yorker as I was coming to NYC to visit my son who is currently resisding in The New Yorker as a student. I was also celebrating my 50th birthday. I read the reviews and must say one reason I was happy to book this hotel was that I was impressed that the management respond to comments made here on Tripadvisor. Arrived at the hotel after along journey, check in went smoothly. Room small but adequate and plenty of storage in separate cupboard, bathroom at little tired but clean. Bed comfortable, and fab view of Hudson River from 37th floor. Would have likedtea/coffe machine in room and maybe some water. Used Tick Tock Diner and Coopers Tavern, both great service. Great location and would love to return.
As a side note, would like to say a HUGE Thank you to the hotel for taking great care of my precious son during Hurricane Sandy.

"“Just hasn't really got it.” My wife and I stayed here as our son is currently in one of the student rooms at the hotel (I believe 5 floors are allocated for this permanently). The lobby and check-in all went well and the staff were friendly and courteous. The BIG problem is that the rooms are just too SMALL - this is a common complaint and I now really do appreciate the other comments. 
To be honest, our Metro room really was tiny and we had a struggle to get any space. The bathrooms are even smaller and our room was certainly in need of an update. I am not a large chap by any means but one towel we were given hardly went round my waist and the other was not much bigger than some other hotel face towels! It almost felt that we were being crammed into what should really have been a single room.

"“Loved New Yorker!” Hotel is in perfect location to see all the sights. Felt very safe walking around this area at night. Upgraded & got brilliant corner room on 22nd floor with lovely view of Empire State. In hindsight, really in NY all you want of a hotel room is the bare minimum as you definitely won't be spending any time there with so much to do & see so it's probably not worth upgrading. No safe in room, just safety boxes in Reception but they are not big enough for an ipad - that's my only moan! Otherwise it was perfect. Tick-Tock Diner serves great food quickly.

"“Our Experience” The hotel was disappointing, we waited a long time to check in. Yes we had heard the rooms can be quite small in New York hotels and that is not wrong. We were disappointed in our room size, had to put our cases n the floor beside bed. Bathroom was so small it was one at a time for using it. You have to go high to get any decent view. Rooms and hallways are very rundown and showing their age and it didn't really feel it was clean and we were told it was four star when we booked. Location is good for walking to everything including hop on hop off bus stop. I gt my hand stuck in the No. 2 lift door, I could not pull my hand out for several seconds and my wife hit the call button and it finally reopened, it hurt that much I was yelling and two ladies came to see what the yelling was about as the doors reopened. I went to report the incident at the concierge, they took all the details and asked if I wanted an ambulance. I didn't request one as my hand was just badly bruised and very sore. My disappointment was that there was no further follow up after the event by any management to see how I had recovered. I think this is very poor behaviour and would not stay there again.",Denis C,2012-09-01,122005,2012-10-25,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.9,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great experience at the New Yorker” We stayed at the New Yorker because it was the preferred hotel and discounted rate for a business trip there. We stayed an extra day and a half to see the city. This was my first time to New York and I didn't have a clue about the location of the hotel. I read every review from Trip Advisor with mixed feelings, as some were good and some weren't. I was a little anxious about how it would really be.
First I can tell you that the hotel is in a great location. Since I had never been to NY, I was afraid of how far we'd have to walk to Times Square & to restaurants. The one thing that shocked me was how safe it is to walk ANYWHERE in New York and how much safer it is than Atlanta where I'm from. I couldn't believe women even walk around at night alone. There are so many people walking together, you never feel afraid. We just don't do that here. It is only a few city blocks walk to Times Square and there are restaurants everywhere. Directly across from the hotel is a TGI Fridays, McDonalds, Famiglia Pizza and on the opposite corner is a cool Mexican Cantina with a roof top seating area. Just a few stores down there is the Houndstooth Pub (awesome english pub - get the Brooklyn Lager if you like craft beer), Dunkin Doughnuts, Chef Yu Chinese Restaurant, and too many others to count.
Second, the staff were all very nice and friendly. I had read on one Trip Advisor review to ask for a coffee maker and you'll get it. Well I asked and almost before we could get to the room they had a nice Keurig with the coffee in our room and brought more when we needed it. Everyone was right, it is very nice to have the Bell staff check your room key before getting on the elevators and when we were leaving, they swiftly hailed us a cab and loaded our luggage in the pouring rain.
Third, the condition and atmosphere is very nice. The lobby is really nice and big and decorated. A week or so before we arrived I called to request a room with a city view (you can request river view or the opposite side city view. I had also requested and upgraded room but because of the conference, it was full. You could probably do this when it's less busy. When we checked in I asked if the room was one of the remodeled rooms and they told me it was (26th floor - great view). Yes, the room is smaller than what you are probably used to in a more recently built hotel, but it was nice and clean. The bed was super comfortable as were the pillows, but come on, really how long are you going to stay in your room. Yes, the water pressure is strong, but I thought that was great. It was like getting a shower massage everyday. People pay good money for for those shower massagers just to get that kind of pressure. And yes, there is only one shelf over the sink to put your toiletries. I just kept most of my stuff I needed for the bathroom in a small suitcase to bring in each time and would set it on the toilet. That is the only thing I can say that the hotel needs is some extra space in the bathroom but I'm not ranting and raving over it. Good grief, get a grip and make do and quit your whining. It's an older hotel and the rooms were made smaller then.
And last, we went to Cooper's in the lobby several times for cocktails and once for dinner. We loved it and I'm telling you they have the best steak I've ever eaten anywhere (Prime Ribeye). We also ate at Tick Tock Diner in the lobby once. The prices are very reasonable and they give you lots of food. Reminded me of the Seinfeld diner but maybe a little nicer.
We also used the business center downstairs to print our boarding passes, but you had to pay about .25 cents per page.
We never had any problems with noise and never experienced any rowdy people at any time.
Bottom line, great location for the price. You can go somewhere nicer and pay more or you can go somewhere farther away and pay less. The hotel is very nice and the staff are great. I would definitely stay here again. If you're not a whiner and complainer about petty little stuff, you'll enjoy staying here.",Cathi D,2012-10-01,122005,2012-10-25,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Love the New Yorker” We stayed at the New Yorker in September for 5 nights.
Check in was great - no queue and we were on the 23 floor. A lot has been said on here about the size of the room. yes they are on the smaller side (I have stayed in smaller in Europe) but it was enough room for my friend and I plus our suitcases. The room we had was two double beds and was very clean and tidy. We really didnt spend much time in there. But the room had a hairdryer plus ironing board and Iron in the wardrobe. We heard very little noise at all. beds were very comfortable. 
The hotel also has complimentary wifi! - we never had a problem with reception in our room or the lobby. You just need to re-check in to the wifi every 12 hours but who can complain when its free!! You can pay for a ""premium wifi"" but we found the free one to be quick enough for uploading photos to facebook etc.
The hotel location is fantastic!! - The empire state building is about 2 blocks down 34th street, Macys is a block or so down the road, old navy, sephoria. So many shops! Public transport is just across the road - Penn Station & the Port Authority bus terminal is a 5 min walk up the road. These will take you anywhere you want to go! Its about a 10/15 min stroll to time square and a couple of block (15/20min) walk to the USS intrepid. We walked alot of places from this hotel. it is so central. We caught the train from penn Station out to yankee stadium, central park, the September 11 memorial. Very easy to use and again so close to the hotel. 
We were 4 female travellers and we felt very safe around new york. No troubles at all. As the hotel is close to major transport hubs there was never a shortage of people around.
There is a 24 hour chemist/supermarket on the corner across from the hotel. Very handy. There are plenty of eateries. There is the diner next door which wasnt bad. There is a mcdonalds over the road, a TGI Fridays plus a pizza restaurant. A short walk up the road, there is subway, another pizza shop that does 2 slices and a can of soda for $2.95!! Bargain and good pizza too. There are two amazing deli's a 5 min walk from the hotel. We purchased our lunch there everyday. So cheap and delish! Salads, subs, paninis, muffins, cakes and soups. There are so many choices in a small area plus there are many more up around 42nd street/times square area.

"“My New Yorker experience” The hotel wasn't quite what I expected. It looked different on the website.....more modern. Although the room was neat, it was small and old. Carpet needs replaced and bathroom should be renovated. There was constant drilling that gave me a headache my first night. I reported it to hotel staff and they didn't believe me. The problem didn't get resolved until two days of listening to this drilling. Then they moved me to a different room. The hot water stopped working and when it came back on rusty water returned with it that left a horrible residue on the wash cloth.

"“Not what I expected from all the reviews” We arrived by train at 9:30 pm and checked in. They were busy at reception but professional. We were tired after riding the train all day so we took our bags to our room & just dropped them so we could go to the Tick Tock diner for dinner. It is crowded 24/7 but they give you more than decent food without a wait to sit down. By the time we finished it was almost 11:00. We went back to the room and after my husband fell asleep I realized they had not given us the queen bed we had requested. Our room was a corner room that was very very tiny & so was the bathroom. The room was pretty clean but not immaculate. After a pretty uncomfortable night we checked out with very surly reception employees. Not in the least bit nice! They also charged us $0.50 a bag to store our bags & then another $0.50 a bag to pick them up! Have never had anyone charge to store bags, including 2 other hotels in New York. I'm convinced we may have been given a small room because we booked our room on booking.com and it was way cheaper. The price we paid however was still ridiculous for the shoebox they gave is.

"“Great place to stay” We were 5 nights at The New Yorker in October and it was great. I wondered given some reviews saying the rooms were cramped and there was a lot of noise from neighbouring rooms -- but that wasn't the case at all. I had been setting myself up by thinking of the hotel rooms of Paris and London which can be very compact. This room was spacious by comparison and a better price than either of those cities. The bed was very comfortable and the room quiet. It was nicely furnished and had the best HVAC system -- ever. Every hotel should check with The New Yorker on how to have a SILENT air conditioning system. We've never experienced anything like it. The room was so pleasant that we hung out for several hours on a couple of days when we were too pooped to walk any farther. We loved the art deco style throughout the building. We also enjoyed both restaurants: Tick Tock Diner and Cooper'sTavern. Tick Tock had great bagels and service was incredibly fast. We ate there every morning before heading out. Great people watching there, too. We had dinner twice at the Tavern which really is a restaurant/cafe not a tavern. The pasta bolognese was great; too big a serving for me. The veal picata the second time was super; great flavours and not too much. Staff were consistently friendly and helpful. Many tourist sites were within walking distance and a central train/metro station was in the same block to take you to places further away. I almost hate to give it such a good review because the price we paid was more than reasonable.",Tansay,2012-10-01,122005,2012-10-23,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Very good hotel - would recommend” We arrived at the hotel and were immediately impressed with the standard. There is a grand concierge at the door of the building, which is close to a few subway stations and only a few blocks away from the Empire State Building and Times Square.
When we arrived, there were only twin rooms available but as we wanted a double room, we asked about an upgrade. The guy on reception, Mohammed, immediately gave us a free upgrade to a corner room, which not only had a double bed but a great view of the Empire State Building. It was amazing, we not only got a view of the ESB but we were able to appreciate the building when it was lit at night. We were on the 23rd floor of the hotel so we did not hear a lot of noise from street level, which was great.
The room itself as of a good size and was serviced daily. With the upgrade, we were also given use of a coffee machine. Towels, toiletries and coffee were refreshed daily, The room was a good size.
Everything about the hotel was great.
The only downside was the diner attached to the hotel, Tick Tock, which does not have any affiliation with the hotel. The food and service was disgusting. The only good thing about it was the moment we got to leave. IT WAS HORRIBLE!! I would not recommend that anyone eats there.",mhazza30,2012-10-01,122005,2012-10-23,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Underwhelmed” The best that can be said for this Hotel is the location. We arrived at 5.30pm but one of our rooms was still not ready. One room was so tiny we had to play 'traffic lights' around the bed and my husband decided it was smaller then our bathroom at home!!. There was no tea/coffee making facilities...not even room service to supply one, so we had to get up and go to the nearest deli....which was a real disappointment on the morning of my 50th birthday! . We didn't have much interaction with the staff, but was surprised when handing back the key at reception that we weren't even asked if we had enjoyed our stay. The bathrooms were outdated and even more compact then the rooms. Our stay in New York was only 3 nights, so we didn't waste time complaining about the rooms as we didn't plan to be in them much anyway. Given the cost it was completely underwhelming.

"“Another great stay” This is my second stay & my husbands first . I chose to come back for location & the staff who did every thing to make this a great stay. Madeline- Guest Service for sorting out my resevation after problems with a stay in 2011. She was true to her word & kept an -upgrade that was 6 mths out of date. Ana on Front desk was so very good sorting out our room . Jim the Bellboy for alway greeting with a smile . We had a suite 3909. The views are so good . The Housekeeping Staff did such a good job, you could eat of the floor & I am fussy. The Hotel is Old . The rooms are smaller that the bigger , newer hotels . Having stayed in Hiltons & Millianuim Hotels which don't have the charm of the New Yorker you miss out. The whole of the staff from Security to Front door staff are always helpful & smiling. 
New Yorker Rides ( Desk in Reception) are the best car service I have ever used -8 trips and second time of using them . We were 2.30hrs later that expected . The driver was still waiting in arrivals for us , no phone calls to make. £50.25 for a town car JFK to Hotel a great service. And a 4.30 am pick up to Newark was on timre & a smiling Driver. Tick Tock Diner is really good. Good food , hugh portions & fast service . We had B&B & the Contental Breakfast was really good , because we were there on a week-end breakfast was in Tick Tock.

"“Excellent Location, easy to get around” We were at the New Yorker in June for a little sibling trip and were happy with this hotel. The folks there were very accomodating and helpful and we appreciated the added security at the elevators, where you are required to show your hotel room key to have access to them.
The location is excellent, walking distance to Times Square, Subways, Penn Station and loads of other things.
The rooms are definitely on the smaller side, my brother and his girlfriend had a very small room and couldn't accomodate all four of us when we were in there, however my sister and I paid for an upgrade to two double beds and it was much more spacious and a standard sized room. Our bathrooms, although basic, were clean and bright, and due to our location our bathroom actually had a small window which was kind of nice. 
The hotel itself is definitely older and not slick like some of the newer hotels, however, they have maintained it very well, it was very clean and for the price and location can definitely say it was a great experience staying here.

"“Nice hotel, area sketchy” Visited New York City in mid September to see two Broadway shows and stayed at the New Yorker, got a good deal on Hotels.com. The hotel is nice, security at the elevators, so no one is going up that is not a guest. Room was clean and beds were comfortable. The room was relatively quiet, outside noise was minimal for being right in the heart of the theater district. This is a high tourist area and very crowded all the time. I would recommend traveling with a few people, not alone whether day or night...just good to be safe. This hotel is right near everything you might want to see in NYC, most are within a short walking distance. We took advantage of the City Sights Hop on Hop off which was a great way to see the city for minimal cost. If you wanted to spend extended time at a stop you simply got off the bus and caught the next one. Beware of folks selling stuff on street corners or just trying to give you stuff for they will want money for it.

"“Safe port in a storm!” We stayed at the New Yorker during hurricane Sandy. We had a suite on the 39th floor which was ideal for me, my husband and our teenage daughter. The hotel is old but charming and the history makes up for the brown paint on the doors! The suite was very clean with comfy beds, two TVs and air con. There was a fridge and coffee maker which was useful given that we were forced to extend our stay. The hotel is perfectly situated for sightseeing, in mid Manhattan and tube, bus and train all within a stones throw. The diner and restaurant were great.
The best thing about this hotel however were the staff. Being away from home and finding yourself in the middle of a hurricane was scary but the staff were reassuring, helpful and accommodating. Many of them stayed at the hotel to make sure guests were looked after and given the damage to neighbourhoods in the area, that was admirable and they worked long shifts to cover.

I have stayed at the New Yorker Hotel twice before - the first back in November 2008 and the second September 2010. (I am only writing this review as I never reviewed on Trip Advisor then)
The first time we was in a small box room, the decor was quite old.... The second time I upgraded us to a suite with a balcony. What a treat! We had two huge TVs, a balcony looking over the city and breakfast vouchers for the Tick Tock diner! 
It is right by Madison Square Garden and has great links to the subway (right next to it), you are only a couple of blocks from Macy's and only a 10 minute walk to Times Sq.

Yes, it wasn't the biggest room, but we were able to open up our suitcases on the floor, and didn't trip over each other through the week. The bathroom could do with renovating as well, the shower was adequate, but seemed to be either very hot or just cold, and they need bigger bath towels! The bed was lovely and comfortable, and the sheets were warm too. The staff at the New Yorker were wonderful, we were greeted with a smile every time we walked back into the hotel after a day exploring the city, the concierge was a big help, and we were even able to leave our luggage after we had checked out and wait for our airport transfer. I would definitely recommend the New Yorker, its simple and you don't need a lot from your room when you're hardly in it, and the location is the best part, it's very central, just 10 minutes from Empire State, and about 20 to Times Square.

Rates are reasonable for NYC. The poor reviews given to this hotel may well be due to poorly considered expectations. Folks, this is an historic hotel and room sizes won't match bigger, newer ones but work well for two people. As for staff attitude ... I lived in the City years ago so was not expecting Mayberry. Reasonable questions asked in a respectful, polite manner were answered in kind, albeit with the classic NY lack of smiles & prolonged eye contact, which should not be taken personally.

"“Expected More” I had high expectations for this once glamorous hotel. The location was great, just a mile from Times Square, lots of shopping in the area, but that is about it. The room was very tiny, the bathroom is dated and our tv didn't work and despite calls to the front desk, it never got fixed. Anytime someone turned on a shower, we heard the pipes rattle and it woke us up. When we checked out, we were waiting for our friend who was also in the hotel, but when he didn't arrive we asked at the front desk and they said he had checked out. It turns out he just slept through his alarm and was still in his room.

"“Great Hotel” Thoroughly enjoyed staying here. Central location. Great Staff and Security. Tick Tock Diner..Excellent! The NewYorker Rides which is affiliated with the Hotel was a Godsend as we were arriving late on a Sat night. The best and courteous service.
My husband lost his little torch and baggage keys which were attached and the next morning we checked with the concierge and presto someone had handed it in when it was found in the foyer and they had put it away for safe keeping. The Security was excellent as well. The Staff checked your key before allowing you to enter into the lifts. The best thing was the view from our room.

Located across the road from Madison Square Garden, Locate above a subway station. Only a 10 minute walk up to Times Square and the theatres. Great service and very friendly and helpful staff that go above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as possible.
We stayed here for a week and fell in love with the hotel and the city. Our room was big by New York standards, we even had a bath in our room which was great as our room looked out on to a piece of the New York skyline.
Security was great we were always asked by staff to show our room key so either we looked dodgy or everyone was being checked which was a great piece of mind. My wife become ill on one day and the cleaning staff were great they made sure we had plenty of towels and tissues and even checked back on us to make sure we were doing okay.

"“Safe in NYC” It would not be acceptable at this time to give any negative comment about this hotel as the staff were amazing in helping everyone staying as guests,evacuees from the immediate area this week and the building itself kept us all safe and sound.
I will be as helpful as possible in anything that appears negative but please do stay here it is wonderful.
Location.....perfect, can walk to all attractions and visit everywhere on foot as long as you wear comfy shoes.Flat soft shoes or trainers best, you will see so many places in a day, dipping in and out of delis, cafes, restaurants and bars on the way. All shopping accessible by foot if you want to.
Rooms.......we were a party of 12 . I booked through Thomson and was told our rooms would have amazing views and would be superb. Some had amazing views, some had large twin (each a double) rooms with 2 windows. Unfortunately ours was a box with just enough room to walk round the bed. Cases had to be stored in corner. The view as we walked in was straight out onto the opposite brick and window wall. My heart sank. The bathroom was fine and fit for purpose. Everything was clean and done daily. We managed to get some amazing photos from the bathroom when we found we could open a 1 in slit. At any other time I would have asked for another room BUT under the circumstances I thought others who may have worried about losing their homes needed them more than we did.
Dining.......the Tick Tock Diner is excellent value and never had to queue for long even when packed. Good range on menu. The fruit and yoghurt is beautiful and makes up for some of the calories taken in throughout the day !!! My family enjoyed the pancakes, Oreo milkshakes, burgers and bacon. Coopers Tavern was more expensive. We had to dine there Monday as we had to remain in the hotel. The food was excellent but you can get good food anywhere and less expensive. The bar in there is very good but prices a bit higher than other local bars. Both dining options have direct access from lobby and no need for coat.
Staff at front of house.....all extremely helpful. Really helped us when needed, got us a minibus to get back to JFK when our limo couldn't get to us. Concierge has theatre tickets but be aware that there are agents fees to add.better to go to TKTAt Times Square, there are several red booths and easy to find. Times Square is 10 min walk away at the most.
Facilities.....very small souvenir shop. Sweatshirts, T shirts, T towels, Aprons etc in basement. Small gym. Clean restroom in basement but remember to take your room key to access.
To conclude this is a perfect hotel and offers good value for money. We will certainly return but not if Sandy is a guest !! It was a very memorable time in so many ways as you can imagine. Thank you to you New Yorker, you have been around for many years and that's what was so reassuring for us on Monday evening x",Carol-and-Pete,2012-10-01,122005,2012-11-03,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“It's alright” This hotel is really big. As a result it feels a little impersonal. After check-in (which went very smoothly), you don't really get to see any staff apart from the security guards in the lobby who check you have your key card, before allowing you up to your room. However, any staff you did speak to were always friendly and answered my questions. Our room was a standard room and was small but adequate - we hadn't planned to spend much time in the room, but then along came Hurricane Sandy!! The bar at the hotel is ok and the food was pretty good, but very expensive. The Tick Tock diner was rubbish - don't eat there!! For breakfast go instead to the International Gourmet Kitchen half a block (2 minutes) North - much better value and much better food.
You can't beat this hotel for location as you can get to all the midtown locations with an easy walk, but not sure I would stay here again.",Graham C,2012-10-01,122005,2012-11-02,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great hotel” My son and I stayed at the New Yorker for 5 days. It was a wonderful experience. The staff were extremely helpful, receptionists, concierge, security, everyone. They gave us tips on where to go, not the tourist traps, but places where the New yorkers go. we went to an Irish bar to watch a football game and had beers with the locals, we visited the areas like the Meat Packing district and found a fantastic French restaurant... all the information was kindly provided by the staff... The hotel was superb, we had a view of New york, the beds were very comfortable and the bedding was changed daily. Downstairs there was a restaurant called Tick Tock where we ended up having breakfast everyday...good food, and most days it was pretty crowded, the prices were very reasonable... even the waiters in the restaurant were friendly and obliging. best of all, this hotel is located near to the Empire State building, Macys and other stores..What can I say..

"“Great Hotel in Central Manhatten” Booked a Suite with two Double Beds for two nights and was allocated room 2607.
I arrived early at 12 noon on an Amtrak train from Washington so the room was not available until 3 pm, no problem there. Went back to reception at 1 pm and was told the room was ready. Caught lift to 26th floor and the room was at the end of a corridor. On entering the room I was greeted by a huge lounge area with a double settee and six very comfortable single seater chairs, there was also a 42"" TV on the wall. Now this room was huge, you could have had a disco party there was so much room.
I proceeded to the bedroom which was big with two double beds and a large desk unit. Off the bedroom was a room to hang cloths, with an ironing board and the usual safe. The bathroom was adequate but a little on the small size considering the size of the two main rooms. In the area between the lounge and bedroom were a mini fridge and a door. To my amazement this led to a balcony looking over 34th Street and down to the Hudson River, how many skyscraper hotels have a balcony!!!!!
To be honest, this is the best room I have ever had in a hotel, the size and amenities were out of this world. I know there are comments about the size of some rooms, but as the old saying says ""you get what you pay for"". The bill for two nights, room only was $959, about £300 per night for two people. We were given complimentary vouchers for continental breakfast of orange juice, croissant (very fresh) and coffee which we took to the room. We also had the breakfast later which was very good, again as near an English breakfast as you could get apart from the crispy bacon which Americans appear to love.
The room was very quiet with a wonderful view down to the Hudson and we encountered no problems with the lifts as we could get one of four lifts to the 20th-40th floors. The reception staff were very helpful as were all the staff we dealt with.

There is no bellman when you arrive if your luggages and the same don`t help you when you`re leaving the hotel till your cab.

"“Just for business” It is a well located hotel and a good option for business travelers since it has various subway stations near, shops and places to eat nearby. It is clean and rooms are bigger than other alternatives considering NY spaces. Nevertheless, I would not recommend this hotel to families, couples or anyone who comes on a vacation. 
It is almost impossible to sleep after 7:30 or 8:00 in the morning! Since rooms are small and next to each other, you listen to the shower of every ""neighbor"" (really loud) every time they use it and you hear slamming doors all night and day...literally, you feel like somebody is entering your room whenever they open their doors. Besides, the cleaning personnel starts early in the morning and they slam doors and make loud noises (talking, laughing, shouting) while cleaning which makes it almost impossible not to wake up.
In addition, they don't have safety boxes in the room, meaning that you have to store valuables using a key along with a hotel worker in order to store or take away anything.....they know everything you are storing and have to make lines everytime you need something!
That being said, I would never come back except for business travel and yet I would think about it if rates were similar to other well located hotels that are more ""boutique"".",C B,2012-10-01,122005,2012-10-19,False,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent location” Arrived at 4pm and was greeted by a very friendly receptionist. Because we had booked this hotel some time ago and she had availability, she upgraded us (foc) to a View Room! We hadn't requested this so were well pleased. Our room on the 35th floor had a view of the Empire State building! The room was well equipped, quite large and very clean. The hotel is in Art Deco style which we loved, and there was a real 'buzz' about the lobby area. The only slight downside was the bathroom, which was quite small, but it had a great shower and was spotlessly clean.
We had breakfast each morning in the Tick Tock diner which was attached to the hotel, and thoroughly enjoyed a different breakfast each day.
We also enjoyed a couple of cocktails each evening in the hotel bar before retiring for the night.
The location of this hotel is fabulous, Penn St station and Madison Square Gardens across the street. Macy's a couple of blocks away and Times Square and broadway within a 20 minute walk away.

"“Overpriced for room” My wife and I stayed 4 nights in October 2012. Because we were attending a conference we supposedly got a better rate - $249/night plus tax. Our room was tiny - or as Jack Benny said it was so small you couldn't even change your mind. There was a double bed, a small desk, and just enough room to walk around. I know NYC is expensive but I thought this was too little room for too much money.
The bed was very comfortable and there was a large flat screen tv. However there was no list of stations. The closet was large.
However, everything was clean and well maintained. As other have stated the hotel is showing a little wear and age. True it is the art deco style but rooms and halls just seemed to be a little dark and uninviting. The lobby on the other hand was large, bright and always full of people.
We had no problem checking in; the room was ready when were checked in about 3 pm. And checkout was a snap. Since the statement delivered to our room on the last night was correct all that was needed was to drop the key cards and key card envelope into the collection box by the elevators.
We found the staff to be pleasant and helpful. We got several restaurant recommendations from staff members and they all were at least acceptable (and a couple really very good). There is a very large fitness center with lots of equipment and very clean.
Location was excellent for what we wanted to do. Taxis were readily available (because of physical limitations we could not use the subways but they were nearby also), (Since we don't go to NYC very often, last time was 8 years ago, we had a little trouble getting taxis to go where we wanted. Then we discovered if you give drivers the cross streets they can take you exactly where you want. Example: We told the taxi driver at the airport we wanted to go the New Yorker Hotel but he had not idea where it was. When we told him 34th Street and 8th Avenue, off he went. This made things mush easier for us and the drivers.)
I would not stay at this hotel again unless we had to attend a conference or meeting there. Small rooms, high cost, and uninviting halls made a less than perfect stay. There are too many other hotels that will offer better accomadations at the same cost.",stl82,2012-10-01,122005,2012-10-17,False,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.1,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Could be great but...” We stayed here in October 2012 and we were booked into a Metro Room with a Queen Size bed. The room was small and a little worn looking but it is New York so I expect this is normal. The location is really superb and our view was terrific so no complaints there. On arrival the Check-In receptionist Ophelia was outstanding. She was very welcoming and helped get us checked in without any fuss. 
On arrival in our room we unfortunately found several hairs stuck to the wall of the shower and pubic hair on one of the towels. I rang down to reception and they immediately sent us someone from housekeeping who cleaned the toilet and shower for us again and replaced the shower curtain. This the reason why I could only score the hotel average and not very good.
Apart from this mishap at the start of our trip everything else was fine until we were presented with our bill and found they it was much higher than the total shown on Priceline. This was my fault as the 15.75% New York taxes were shown (in tiny tiny writing) on the Priceline bill but please anyone booking a room in NY make sure all taxes are included. It was a costly error on my behalf but one I won't be making again.

The guy on the desk apologised for it only having a queen size bed but it was fine. We were out and about so didn't stay in the room too much but it was clean and everything worked OK. Used the hotel gym once and it was quiet with good equipment.

"“Good Location, Good Service, Terrible Checkout Experience” The hotel is very efficient for a short stay in NY, especially if NY is not your final destination - close to all attractions, one block away from Penn Station (good if you take Amtrak or just want to go to JFK during rush hour), one block away from Hertz location - but do not expect the quality of The Ritz. 
We had a ""View Deluxe Room with Two Double Beds,"" which was reasonably large (around 30 sq.m) and well equipped. Housekeeping supplied a coffee machine and capsules for both tea and coffee (not Nespresso, more like drip coffeemaker). The view was good, although a nearby rotten skyscraper spoiled it a bit. The bathroom was reasonably clean, but the pale green tiles and worn toilet seat lowered overall score. Housekeeping was somewhat intrusive and kept checking every 30 min whether they could clean the room, even though we told them to come in a couple of hours. Check-in was very nice and friendly, and normally the front desk staff was nice and friendly. 
The whole experience was ruined during check-out, when a ""very decorated"" front desk agent with obviously excessive testosterone level scoffed (literally): ""I give you TWO (!) minutes to run up and bring your bags down in order to avoid late check-out penalty (they charge $25 per hour after 12:00)"" - even though late check-out was pre-agreed with someone else the night before. [needless to say, after such hospitality, I made a point in coming down exactly 2 min before the time paid for]. That was particularly frustrating given that we chose more expensive New Yorker (solely for the view) over nearby Hilton, where I would receive royal treatment and 4 PM checkout as a Diamond Member. Even though another front desk person tried to get me a refund, and the hotel *sort of* apologized after that in an e-mail from the guest relations manager, we left with pretty bitter aftertaste.",MikhailMOW,2012-09-01,122005,2012-10-15,False,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.6,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Wonderful Stay in Great Location” I booked this hotel via Expedia for a NYC weekend trip for my wife's 30th birthday. As with any blind booking site (hotwire, expedia), I was somewhat skeptical on finding myself with The New Yorker as it didn't have the brand recognition as a Hilton, W, or Sheraton even. But once we arrived and checked into our room on the 35th room, I instantly knew that this hotel was going to be exactly what I hoped for.
We reserved a Metro room which is (if you've read reviews on TripAdvisor) as explained: tight quarters, art deco decorations, small bathroom. I actually found the room to be slightly bigger than I imagined (I was expecting a glorified closet), with a workable walk-in closet, desk w/ chair, a ledge along the windows for my luggage, and a comfortable queen size bed. If there's one drawback, it's the size of the bathroom - it's serviceable but with all of my wife's toiletries, there left little space for my stuff. It was cramped, but the thunderous water pressure from shower more than made up for it.
Location defines the true value of The New Yorker hotel. On 8th avenue, we were, at most, just four blocks from all the major subway lines (1,2,3; ABC, L, R, E) and though we didn't need it, Penn Station & Madison Square Garden are literally across the street. We were able to walk to our Off-Broadway show (Avenue Q) and to the High Line walkway on the West side. Most of our excursions were in downtown, SoHo, NoLita, Murray Hill, and we never had to switch subway lines nor need more than 15minutes door-to-door to arrive at our location. Outside of sleeping, we didn't spend a lot of time in our hotel and the location of The New Yorker makes it a perfect base camp.
We didn't experience any of the grips I had read about The New Yorker on TripAdvisor. Our check-in went very fast and smooth. The lobby was busy but never crowded or to the point of annoying. We never waited longer than 30 seconds for an elevator and often it seemed like our own private elevator. Our Metro Room on the 35th was very quiet and we could barely make out the honking and sirens of Manhattan. The cleaning staff did a great job with our room and we had our towels refreshed when requested. 
Overall I felt that I received a lot of value from what I paid for a two night stay at The New Yorker. If you plan to spend a lot of time in your room and require a lot of space, a modern bathroom, and need that pampering feeling, than spend $500+ a night and hope you can come close in NYC. If you appreciate the basic necessities of a room, value location, and know your way around NYC, than The New Yorker will be a perfect fit for you. Finally want to give a big thanks to Ronny Yagual, Guest Service Mgr at the New Yorker - he made our stay one that we'll appreciate for years to come!!",TheWindyCityTraveler,2012-10-01,122005,2012-10-15,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Location” My husband and i stayed at the new yorker hotel for 5 nights in early october.
The room was very clean and nicely decorated however the room was very small! We had nowhere to put out suitcases except on the floor between the bed and the wall.
The hotel was in a great location! 2min walk from macy's and the empire state and a 5min walk to times square/broadway. It was also across the road from mcdonalds and starbucks and there is a diner downstairs which is a bit expensive but you wont leave hungry.

"“First class everything at the New Yorker” Travelling from Australia as a family of four with kids aged 8 & 5. We were originally booked into a midtown apartment but, while in Vancouver and with only 36 hours notice, the apartment suffered a terminal plumbing issue and became unavailable. After three anxious hours late night searching on the 'net we found the New Yorker. Despite calling at 03:00 NY time, the front desk staff booked us straight in, for 14 nights, room with 2 double beds, and even managed to arrange early checkin as we flew overnight via Toronto.
Without exception, the staff were great - curteous, efficient, friendly. The room had a point blank view of Empire State Building. And was everything it should have been (well, maybe the bar fridge should be standard). Bathroom was completely functional though a little cosy on space.
Location, location, location. The hotel is beautiful and one of those fabulous NYC iconic spaces. Deco vintage but refreshed for contemporary needs. Tick Tock Diner was perfect for breakfast and we had a fine dinner at Coopers, the hotel restaurant.
Overall, it was more expensive ($350/night) than we had budgeted for but, for a hotel stay, it was fabulous, fun, and a great introduction to NYC. Highly recommended.

"“Big money, tiny, tiny room.” For $400 per night, you expect a little charm, a little something extra. If you stay here, set your expectations far lower. You will get a room the size of a shoebox with a view of another building and a tiny bathroom that feels like a public school locker. This hotel is devoid of charm and is simply a place to sleep for a night, nothing more, nothing less.

"“Not the biggest room but comfortable.” We came to New York to celebrate Canadian Thanksgiving weekend. We traveled by train to Penn Station which is only a 100 yards from The New Yorker Hotel. We were greeted by the doormen with a cheery smile and a welcome to The New Yorker. The front desk staff were as equally pleasant and cheery to deal with during our stay. The lobby is very impressive and seems to retain it's orginal charm. You will need to show your room key to pass sercurity to access the elevators. 
The room we had was well, lets just say it was small for sure. If you have been on a cruise ship, the room would be about the same size or a touch smaller. The room would not be classified as luxury by any means but it was certainly comfortable and clean. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was high end. The bed we has was a queen though it felt a little smaller. If you are person or a couple of size I would certainly request 2 queens or a king bed upon booking as there are not many of them available. The bathroom was functionable though having two people in there is certainly a challenge. Also, the water temperature is not consistant so be prepared for hot and cold blasts.
The location of The New Yorker is certainly a great feature. A short walk to the subway, Penn Station, Times Square and Broadway.
I would stay here again.",Duane L,2012-10-01,122005,2012-10-13,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location.” Great location for a hotel, that can't be denied, however a hotel cannot sell itself purely on that. First impression of the building was fantastic, beautiful art deco features, gorgeous public areas. greeting by reception staff was friendly but unhelpful. Our room wasn't ready despite our arriving at the check in time of 3pm. The man on the desk then told us he couldn't give us an estimated time that it would be ready because if he did and we returned and it still wasn't ready it would give us cause for complaint! We were left in limbo with our hand luggage to wander in the local area and get a drink from a local diner after travelling for 19 hours. An hour later room still not ready, then some confusion as he realised this room wasn't going to be cleaned until late evening, tried to allocate us another room, also not ready, told to wait in reception and he would come to us as soon as ready. Another hour passed, asked another member of reception staff who found a room that was ready and finally gave us this one at 5pm! Room had lovely art deco features, fantastic views but despite a recent refurbishment it was shabby. Tile paint peeling off in the bathroom and an ineffectual shower. Tiny wardobe space and no drink making facillities.
Concierge very unhelpful when enquiring about how to get 911 memorial garden passes, she was more interested to try and sell tickets for a boat trip which included passes than helping us with the enquiry. 2 lovely irish lady guests in the business centre helped us get online and we booked passes within 3 minutes, something the concierge could easily have done or advised where and how we could do this. Stay if you want to gaze out of the window all day. Other hotels are just as central and probably will provide more facillities and better service.

"“Great location” Just returned from a four night stay at The New Yorker Hotel and was not disappointed. When I originally booked the room I requested a good view and on arrival the lovely Receptionist upgraded us to a corner room which was perfect! Thank you! The view of the Empire State building and 8th Avenue was awesome and the room had two queen beds and plenty of space. The bathroom was small by 4* standards and yes it was in need of refurbishment but it was more than adequate for our stay. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom and plenty of towels though I would say the bath towels were a bit small (please note). Pleased to see an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe though the room safe did not work. There is, however, a safe deposit box at Reception.
The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and it was so cosy we found it hard to get up in the morning! Room was on 28th floor with double glazed windows so no traffic noise and very quiet.
During our stay we used the small Cafe in the Foyer for breakfast food of coffee and pastries. They had a good selection of yoghurt and fruit too all of which you can take up to your room. On the last morning we had breakfast in the Tick Tock diner which is within the Hotel (will write a separate review).
The New Yorker Hotel has a great location making it easy to walk to a lot of tourist attractions, eg Times Square, Broadway or Empire State Building or alternatively take the Subway just round the corner.
Staff throughout the Hotel were friendly and helpful and I would highly recommend The New Yorker as a great place to stay.",jehinch,2012-10-01,122005,2012-10-12,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Will Look Elsewhere...” Currently staying in the hotel, where Borg our reservation agent and two separate Front Desk employees have given us a major run around. Promised (in writing, brought proof) an Empire State Building view room, but despite written confirmation room was not blocked off for us. Fine says new front desk clerk, you can have one for the next four nights of your stay. Next day, we confirm with the morning clerk that we are moving (packed and ready to go) and she says room not ready but no worries, we can leave bags in current room and whenever we return (even late), room awaits us. We return at 5:05 and alas, same clerk as LAST night says we are late and room was given away. But HEY! How about free breakfast tomorrow (as a FAVOR) and we will get you that room tomorrow! Breakfast Vouchers to be brought to our room tonight! Guess what? 12:21 and no vouchers yet! 
This and two days of dirty towels (crusty blood clot in one, makeup in another) have left a bad taste in our mouths. We are backpackers historically, and we consider ourselves low maintenance. This was our 10 year anniversary trip though, and at $300/nt for a tiny room, I'd expect more. 
My story would be different if our service had been better. 
Best comment at this point (day 2 of 5) is, great central location and comfy pillows. Hoping the next 3 days are better.

"“Great bargain, unique decor, ""security"" obnoxious” This is a great hotel in a great location in that rotten cesspool called NYC (Never going there again, ever! Suck it, NYC!) People were generally polite, the gift shop pricing was actually reasonable (compared to the shady tchotchke shops on the rotten streets of rotten NYC), rooms were clean and remained clean, and the art deco decor was a wonder to see. The excellent location ensures that you can just get on the bus or train and go anywhere quickly. The only bad experience came from the rent-a-security douches who insist on stopping you every g-d time you tried to get to the elevators to get to your room. May be this was for some imagined security concerns but it made a nice hotel feel like a darned prison - not cool at all.

"“Great Hotel generally but Front Desk needs better service” The location of the New Yorker is great, as good as you can get in Manhattan. Its beautiful in an art decor style and is spotless - its very clean and tidy. 
The Tick Tock diner attached has very good food but does get very busy. But it is open 24 hours so you can always pop in and the staff are good but rushed off their feet. Highly recommended. Most of the staff we found to be excellent in particular we found the Security Staff near the lifts to be very courteous and friendly. The lifts were speedy and with virtually no wait.
The Cooper Tavern we found it so/so the staff just seemed to be not bothered with service - perhaps it was a one off but we didn't go back there again.
The room is small but it is Manhattan. We booked a double but there was adequate storage space. The bed was good. There is temperature setting in the room but we did find that there was a distinct draft from the window side so especially that side of that room could get cold. The views though are amazing.
The restroom amenities are acceptable - the shower and bath taps are in the deco style (4 wind up taps) so they take a bit to get used to.
Only thing that we gave a mark down on was the front desk we had an issue over a prepayment -within the hotel. It took 3 visits a long wait and additional proof (even though proof was originally given) to get what we paid for. They went from not believing us, to then not giving us what we wanted to finally agreeing that there was an error and we got what we had paid for albeit on the 2nd day. We did not get recompense for the 1st day it was not even mentioned but the thing that stuck was that they did not apologize at all.

Some of the communal areas, halls etc were in need of a lick of paint, but certainly nothing to complain about or that would spoil our stay. W arrived early, but the receptionist found us a room early for us to check into, and actually upgraded our room. We were on the 24th floor. The room was spacious, there was 3 in our party and we had 2 good sized queen beds and 2 bathrooms. The rooms were cleaned daily to a high standard. The rooms didn't have safes but there was a safe available free of charge at reception which could be accessed 24 hours a day.

"“Look out for Mohammed...!” We travelled as a party of 4 to New York for my 30th Birthday celebration, and stayed in the well recommended New Yorker Hotel. On arrival, we were greeted by Mohammed on the front desk, who could not have been more helpful. On finding out it was my birthday he went way out of his way to get us one of the best rooms and presented me with some special hotel chocolates as an added little treat! He really went above and beyond for us and he is a true credit to the Hotel. As is Benny, who spent a long time with us chatting, giving us traveller advice and recommending various spots for us to see that we would not have found on our own - and not forgetting Marco either, who was also very friendly and helpful.
The room itself was excellent, cleaned and tidied daily - the maids were also very polite and friendly when we saw them. The bed and pillows are worthy of a mention alone as they were so comfortable - a rare treat in hotels these days! 
I have ""a thing"" about bathrooms and this one didn't disappoint - a lovely hot and powerful shower and nice clean towels as required. 
The views from the room were great and despite being in such a prime location, the noise at night was minimal and didn't interrupt a good sleep. 
The neighbouring ""Tick Tocks"" diner which is twinned with the Hotel offered wonderful food at reasonable prices, again with lovely staff - Joseph was particularly chirpy even in the morning rush! The free piece of delicious NY Cheesecake I was given for my birthday was a lovely gesture. 
We really only used the Hotel as a 'base camp' while we explored NYC and prior to our arrival we were not concerned with it being anything more than that, but with such lovely staff, rooms, food, etc, etc, we were more than pleased with our choice. 
I should add that the location is great, as we found out when we stumbled upon Times Square on our first nights stroll 'down the block'!

Although the room wasn't large it was clean and very quiet (25 floor above street). Would be nice to have had tea making facilities, especially in the morning - having to get showered and dressed before a cup of tea is not my idea of fun. That said there was a good coffee and pastry stand in the foyer!!

"“Great hotel for a family! Loved it.” We stayed at the New Yorker late September with our 2 girls, aged 6 & 9 years. When we arrived Mohammed moved us from our original Tower Suite room overlooking the Hudson River to a better view directly facing the Empire State Building. Awesome! Our room was on the 39th floor with 1 bedroom (2 beds) and a sofa bed in the lounge room. The kids actually enjoyed sleeping on the sofa bed! Being on the top few floors entitles you to a complimentary continental breakfast, which was just down the hallway. There was a good selection of cereals, toast, bagels, fruit, juices & coffee. It was a perfect way to start each day, particularly as we did a lot of walking.

“Great location” 3 of us were travelling & stayed here. The room & the beds were both very small/compact. The rooms are modestly decorated. That said the housekeeping staff were lovely & cleaned it seemed daily - we stayed for 5 days. Our room was on the 29th floor & had a spectacular view of the Empire State Building. The reception & information staff were very nice & helpful. We did encounter 1 less than helpful member of staff on 1 of the nights where it lashed rain & we needed assistance getting a cab - he was the only member of staff who was not helpful. The Tick-Tock Diner attached to the hotel is wonderful - great staff & food. A definite bonus for the hotel.

"“Small rooms, but great location to explore NY” Had a good stay in the New Yorker Hotel. The room is quite small, and with our 3 suitcases there is not much room left to move around. This was expected, and since we're not going to New York to stay in a hotel room it was sufficient.
Location of the hotel is excellent, close to Penn Station and Herald Square, so easy to get in the undergound to move around the city. Times Square is also within walking distance.
Only issue in the room was the airconditioning, which made a lot of noise on the lowest setting and had a rattle every 15 minutes when turned off.

"“Clean, comfortable and a convenient location” Stayed for one night before flying out of the US.
Arrived a few hours before check-in, but thought I would ask if anything was available. The lady at the front desk not only found me a room for immediate check-in, but gave me a complimentary upgrade as well.
My room was on the 34th floor. My door was sandwiched between two others in a u-shape, however I never ran into anyone else while I was there. The room itself was of typical size for something in NY, but the bed was comfortable and the room was clean.
The power points were a little tricky to access, I had to get under the desk and leave my phone/laptop on the floor to charge. The only other negative was that it took a very very long time for the shower water to heat up. I had actually resigned myself to a luke warm shower, then part way through the water heated up enough that I had to turn on the cold tap a fair bit.
Location is fantastic, close to a couple of major subway stations and walking distance to Times Square. I chose this hotel specifically for the location as I knew I didn't have long to fit in all my shopping!
Below the lobby there is a small shop, mainly touristy trinkets, but conveniently also sells air mail stamps. There is a post box in the lobby, so I was able to send the postcards I had forgotten to write! Connecting to the lobby is the Tick Tock Diner, nothing special but after a long tiring day, was happy for a standard diner type meal simply for the convenience of not having to walk anywhere else.

You cant beat the location, very close to Empire State Building, Times Square, Penn Station and Macy´s. The Tick Tock Diner located in the same building as The New Yorker offers good food at reasonable prices with great service.

"“Great Location” Arrived 03/12/12 in New York for my 1st time.
Hotel was in a great location just a couple of streets away from Macey's department store and Empire State Building. Also just a 10 minute walk to Times Square.
We had to queue to check in but this is possibly due to being in December there were 4 receptionists so we didn't queue for long. 
Our room was located on 32nd floor. It was a bit small to other hotels i've stayed in. It was clean and modern. The bathroom could have done with a bit of TLC but you don't go to New York to stay in the room. 
Attached to the hotel was a diner and a restaurant. we ate at both of these and recommend them.
If you have never been to New York before, the taxi's, restaurants etc all expect to be tipped and they will ask for one if you don't give it straight away. They all put about 15% plus onto your bill.

The hotel is an iconic art deco style, it is very centrally located, handy for the shops on 34th street, Times Square and Broadway, Empire State building and central for any other part of the metropolis. Metro is right by the hotel.
The room was very comfortable and clean, bathroom a little small. Despite being right in the heart of the city, it was really quiet. Free wifi. The staff were helpful, though telling us we were getting an upgrade to a superior room was just not true, we got the room we booked and paid for.

"“Perfect Stay at the New Yorker” After a long but trouble free flight from Birmingham England. Myself 16yr old daughter and sister couldnt wait to arrive in New York (our first trip), arriving Nov 29th to Dec 2nd. 
Reception staff couldnt have been more helpful and as the trip was mainly a present for my daughter for her 16th the Receptionist gave her 2 small token boxes of chocolates on our arrival and a free upgrade to a Tower Suite on the 40th floor with an amazing view of the ESB and the Chrysler Building. The bathroom was small but nice and the beds really comfortable with good quality bed linen etc. My sister said the sofa bed in her room was very comfortable and the coffee maker was excellent. The whole Art Deco theme is lovely and it was nice to stay in a hotel with a bit of history.
We also were given vouchers for 'free' breakfasts at the Tick Tock Diner, the food was good and the atmosphere great. 
One evening we ate in Coopers Tavern after a very busy day sight seeing and shopping and i have to say the Margaritas flowed, the food was great and the service excellent.
The location of the New Yorker is perfect, easy walking distance to Times Square and right next to Maceys and loads of excellent shops.

"“Not the Best, Not the Worst.” We drove in from New England and hoped to take advantage of their valet parking, went around the whole building and could not find where to pull up for valet. Only accessible spot was filled with taxis, so we parked in a random garage around the corner. We were in a major rush because we had tickets to the Anderson Live taping so we didn't have time to deal with the parking situation. Hotel's in a pretty decent spot on 34th & 8th, just a few blocks from the Times Square vicinity, but far enough away that you have better restaurant options and prices. After the show we went back to get our luggage from the garage and check in. The lady who checked me in was so not interested in her job or me as a guest. She was complaining about something and threatening to leave to her co-workers. She barely spoke to me, took forever, couldn't figure out how to check me in because I had pre paid, so another lady had to show her. I kindly mentioned the issue with valet and she interrupted my sentence and barked at me to talk to the door man. I hate it when hotel staff don't have answers about basic guest services. I didn't bother with the door man. I asked if I could have a fridge because we had a guest with insulin. The lady acted like asked for a free room and said i had to pay. Most hotels will not charge for medical reasons but whatever. I'm not too worried about it all because we got the room for $193 for 3 guests per night when it was normally $270 something. They put us on the 19th floor, room number 1945. I must say that the corridors looked a bit shabby, like renovations were being done, the way the concrete trim matched the concrete floored corridors, with a runner down the middle...just a bad choice. Our room was RIGHT off the elevator, big enough with 2 full beds, 2 nice chairs and 2 huge double windows facing the Empire State Building. Great view, comfortable room. No coffee in room. Pillows were great, beds a bit saggy in center but comfortable enough. The size of the room was good. All 5 of us total could hang out in one room comfortably. I was charged to make a local phone call, literally half a block up the street. The bathroom was big enough. The shower took a while to get warm. We ate at the tic tock diner down stairs. Not too bad, burger was a tad dry, but low prices. We stayed 2 nights. Had to use the business center to print out a page. Couldn't get it to print out, then realized we had to select a printer. Those settings should be set already in my opinion. You can swipe your card right on the desktop to pay, min. Fee $1.40. Upon check out we asked to hold our bags. It's $1 per bag. They ask for half up front and the other at pick up. That was quick and efficient! Oh and the incidental deposit/hold on your card is $45 per night. The garage where I parked only charged me the car rate and I had a van. They also charged me less on the overage than they advertised. I parked for 53.5 hours. They are on 35th on the left side, Lincoln Parking. I was happy that I parked myself, they are open 24 hrs and I could get to my stuff in my car at any time. As for The New Yorker, I might stay again if the price works, but it wouldn't be because I love the hotel. I had to call them about an odd charge on my card when I got home. Before I could get the words out the lady cut me off and answered me w/o knowing my question. I had to tell her to stop and ask her to LISTEN to me. She had such a hard time doing that. Once she did it was resolved.

"“Perfect Location & Affordable...” I stayed with a friend for 6 nights in the New Yorker. For us it was all about location & affordablity, New York is one of the most expensive cities when it comes to accommodation & value for money. This hotel has a perfect location, its hop skip & jump from from Macy's & Penn Station/Madison Square Gardens & 3 or for blocks from Times Square/Broadway Shows. We stayed in a double room it was little tight for floor space but it was clean & rooms were seen to everyday. The staff were helpful & friendly we had problem with hairdryer in the bathroom, rang down to receiption & they sent up someone up to fix straight away. The hotel its self has an old feel to it, when you get out of lift to its dated but i kinda liked that, it was step back in time a little, art deco feel to it...

"“This is the place to stay.” I am so glad our travel agent reccomended this hotel. It is situated in a great part of New York, very close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. It is only a short walk to Times Square. The hotel itself is very clean and has good size rooms. It has a very good fitness centre for the most part the staff are quite helpful. You can get good coffee and pastries in the foyer in the morning and you can walk through to the Tick Tock Diner, a fantastic classic diner that serves great food.

“Great location” Stayed here for 5 nights in December 2011. The hotel was in a fantastic location right opposite the empire state building and Maddison square garden. The rooms were very good with comfortable beds. Would definately recommend this to anybody who wants a sightseeing holiday in new York city. The staff were friendly and helpfull. There was a mc Donalds opposite the hotel which we used to grab a breakfast before going sightseeing.

Both were full bathrooms and the room was a good size. The hotel is in a good location opposite Penn Station, handy for a short walk to Times Square and a little longer walk to Ground Zero and Grenwich Village.

"“Great location, good for the price, nice and easy.” Spent a week in August 2012 on our first visit to New York, as previously stated great location for the sites, best of all near Penn Station so we got the NJ Transit to and from Newark Airport and found that really easy, rather than a taxi. Hotel was clean, rooms smallish but did the job and I was suprised how quiet it was at night - we were on the 21st floor. Air conditioning quiet and easy to control. Staff efficient and if you took the time to engage them, were friendly enough. TICK TOCK diner was a godsend if you had a long day and just wanted to eat well, without going miles and then relax.

The hotel was very inviting; we arrived from LaGuardia via New York Rides ( they were late, see that review); and were dropped off at the front door at 9 am. Our room wasn't ready at first but within 10 minutes we were in. We were on the 36th floor with a corner view so we had a great view of the city from two directions -- financial district, ESB and Madison Sq Garden. The room was clean, beds are great, relatively small room but expected in NYC; bathroom clean, towels fluffy; security on duty most of the time; conceirage useful; lower level gift shop great with good options, Overall perfect location, never ate at restaurant or used the fitness facility since we were barely there at all but I woud stay again.",henney88,2012-09-01,122005,2012-10-01,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Small Room, Terrific Location” My wife and I stayed for two nights (Thurs - Sun). We had a very good stay, and staying at the New Yorker provided advantages other locations may not have provided us. 
First off, yes, the rooms are small. Our room on the 31st floor was about the size of a large bedroom. It had a queen sized bed which was comfortable. There was a small LCD TV (appropriate size for the room). A smal dresser, and a small desk. The bathroom was small, but it served it's purpose (plenty of hot, hot water in the shower). There was also a closet which was very well sized for the room. The room was clean. One thing about the room, yes it was small, but honestly, how much room does one need? My wife and I stay hotels all over, and this was the smallest room I've ever stayed in, but after the initial ""Wow, this is a small room"", it was never an issue.
The location is incredible. The subway is steps from the front door of the hotel. Times Square, 5th Ave, and Madison Square Garden are within easy walking distance. 
Aside from being one of the first grand New York Hotels with a ton of history, (Nikola Tesla spend the last 10 years of his life here, JFK stayed here while running for president, Mohammad Ali stayed here the night he fought Sonny Liston) it is right in the heart of Midtown Manhattan. You get up in the morning to go for coffee and you are right in the heart of New York. After a Broadway show you are an easy walk home. You are a 10 minute subway ride from either Uptown or Downtown. 
We drove in and parked with the Valet ($35/day) and it was easy. For a few extra bucks we were able to stay in Manhattan vs. New Jersey and it was easy to stop by the hotel to drop off bags, take half an hour to change and sit for a bit, or change for a night out. Very well worth it. 
I would stay here again, and I would recommend this hotel.",sneaky291,2012-09-01,122005,2012-10-01,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“What a great decision!” After trawling the internet for weeks I finally settled on the New Yorker Hotel 34th on 8th, it had mainly good reviews and was recommended by 2 people.
We were so happy we stayed here for my husbands 50th birthday, it looks great from the outside,and you are welcomed the minute you walk in by friendly staff who look you in the eye rather than down their noses.
We were dealt with promptly and efficiently at reception,and given a lovely room which had been upgraded for us from a metro room to a view room by customer relations manager Ronny,after I emailed him with my concerns after reading some trip advisor reviews. The room was great, and the view of the empire state building on one side and madison square gardens on the other, I will never forget! We even slept with the curtains open as it seemed wrong to draw them!
They have clearly spent lots on this hotel but fabulously not modernised it beyond recognition, bathroom fittings all looked original,as did the tiles,and door and the hallways and lifts all looked original art deco,so there is a real sense of history and wondering who has slept there,and walked the hallways.
Its location is perfect for a first time visitor too,very central to everywhere you want to get to,without the loud music and lights of times square.We literally got the cab from jfk (65$ with tip/toll), dumped our bags and walked to empire state building(fastrack pass highly recommended, your time is too precious to waste queueing for 2 hrs), and were taking in the view within an hour!!
We had a bad experience at the restaurant we had booked on our first night so we left and came back to hotel in the hope the concierge could save our evening,and sure enough the lovely Sheila managed instantly to get us a table for half an hour later in her favorite restaurant Tribeca grill, now thats not easy on a friday night in NYC.
The 24 hr tic toc diner attatched is ideal when you wake up at 4am starving hungry,and there is a very reasonably priced gift shop in the basement, along with a room where you can easily print off your boarding passes and use the internet for free for 10 minutes.

"“Great Location - Needs Modernising” The New Yorker is in a great spot, close to Times Square/42nd St without being on top of it, it is on top of Penn Station - so great for subway connections and Amtrak. The rooms are the smallest I have ever been in and I spend alot of time in hotels around the world. However it was comfortable, in fact the beds and pillows were great. Its a very busy hotel, so a bit hard to get that friendly personal touch from staff, but they were friendly. The Tick Tock diner does a great breakfast and its cheap.

"“Lovely Art Deco Hotel in the heart of NYC!!!!” I stayed here to celebrate my 50th in September.My children selected it as I love Art Deco, I wasn't disappointed! The Hotel was very nice. The lobby was impressive.Each floor had a lovely seating area with table and lamps, which lent to the Art Deco feel. We stayed on the 37th floor with a spectacular view overlooking The Empire State and Chrysler building. The room was very clean and comfortable if a little small, with a flat screen TV The bathroom was also on the small side, but very nicely decorated, with a couple of original features.. We stayed for four nights, my only criticism if pushed, would be that the shower went from freezing cold to boiling hot in seconds then back again. I suppose being on the top floors with such spectacular views some sacrifices have to be made!! It wasn't the end of the world, though if you were travelling with children, it may be an issue.The bed was lovely and comfortable, we only saw staff on check in and check out and they were very friendly and efficient.

"“I loved it” This is a belated review I am writing after staying in the hotel this summer. First off, let me just say - yes, the rooms are small, very small compared to hotel rooms in the rest of the country. However, this is true of almost any hotel in New York City, especially Manhattan. There just is not enough room for large hotel rooms as they are found in other parts of the country - real estate is at a premium. But I loved staying at the New Yorker. 
The hotel is older, but I found the vintage features to be charming and I also enjoyed staying where so many prominent literary and historical figures stayed over the years. My room was tiny but comfortable and I loved my vintage-style bathroom. Room was very clean and quiet. I rarely heard noise from the hall or from the adjoining rooms, and door opening/closing noise has started to become my pet peeve in hotels, where you can hear doors slamming open and closed all day and night. Maid service was efficient and everything in the room worked well, and the staff was responsive when I needed them. No problems with the elevators. I found the room to be kind of an ""oasis"" from the city's noise and hustle.
The best part of the hotel is the location. The New Yorker is located literally on top of Penn Station and any entrance to the station - from which you can get anywhere in New York you need to - is mere feet away from the entrance. Madison Square Garden is just down the street, and there is nice shopping down the block in both directions - clothing, shoes, etc. Fifth Avenue is close and you can buy just about anything clothing-wise you want within a few blocks of the hotel, if you're inclined that way. The New Yorker is in a very busy and bustling area with lots of tourists, if that bothers you. But it is very easy to get cabs in front of the building (if you don't take the subway), and hotel is also in a very walkable neighborhood. I walked back to the hotel from Radio City Music Hall one night at about 10 pm and had a great time and never felt unsafe. The Tick Tock Diner, under the hotel, is OK. I ate there for one meal and it was nothing special, typical diner food. But it is nice to have an onsite meal option for long days when you don't feel like searching for a restaurant. 
What I will say about the area is that it is kind of touristy and not upscale - there are mostly chain stores, chain restaurants, etc. If you're looking for posh, or quirky, you'll need to try another neighborhood. But that's relatively easily accomplished, with the subway so nearby. 
I really think this is a gem as far as Manhattan hotels go - no frills, but nice rooms in a great location for a relatively reasonable price. During this same trip, I visited a friend who was staying in a very expensive upper East Side hotel and her room was no nicer or bigger than mine - but had cost her three times as much per night. In Manhattan, you do not always get bigger or better when you pay more, when it comes to hotels.",foodiechick77,2012-06-01,122005,2012-09-30,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

But the staff here, particularly those behind the reception desk, were impatient and unclear about certain important aspects.

The New Yorker is well situated adjacent to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. The Empire State Building and Times Sq are within a few minutes walk.
The rooms have recently been renovated and have an Art Deco theme.
The rooms a not big but are clean and facilities are good.
There are no safes in the rooms but safety deposit boxes are available in reception.

"“Great hotel. Good location.” We stayed here for four nights in August 2012. Staff were very helpful on arrival. Room was not huge but very adequate. Lovely Art Deco bathroom. We were on the 33rd floor and had a great view of the Empire State Building and also the Chrysler Building. On the ground floor was the Tick Tock diner and the Tavern bar. We made good use of these. Excellent location. Entrance to Penn station at he side of the hotel, Madison Square Garden on the opposite corner. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby. Macy's was just a block away. We made good use of the subway system which was very easy to use, as well as having a New York Pass, which saved us quite a bit of money.

"“Great Service At The New Yorker Hotel” I have been staying at the New Yorker Hotel since May 2012 traveling there nearly every week. The physical hotel is good, however the people providing the services are GREAT! That is what makes a hotel ! Especially at the check-in desk, they are polite and very knowledgeable. In particular is Ornelia Green; she is a great asset to the hotel. She is well versed in all aspects of the hotel and describes things clearly in a very friendly and professional manner. This is her normal way of being at all times she has assissted me. One time I left my credit card there by mistake and checked out -- I wasn't even one block away and she called me on my cell phone. Consistant, reliable, friendly, smart and very professional!!!

"“KEEP GOING BACK” Stayed here for the second time in three trips to New York . the hotel is nice and central being across from Penn station and Madison Square Gardens and three blocks from Mac'ys . Its also a little walk away from times square or you can get the subway from across the road or around the corner if you like . 
it has a 24 hr diner and a Tavern attached to it as well as a business centre and fitness centre and gift shop downstairs . Used the diner and the tavern both very nice and prompt service with good food . the hotel itself is very security concious and in the evening you have to show your room card to security (not a bad thing these days ) . ALL STAFF in the hotel are polite helpful and take time to listen (a rare thing sometimes ). 
It is a large old building bursting with character and its even good just to sit in the foyer area and admire the décor and enjoy the chilled air its always nice and cool a relief when its hot outside !!
There are free safe deposit boxes in reception however you must join the queue to access them as they are dealt with by reception , be patient the staff can be busy at times .
We love this hotel and will definitely be returning again as soon as ! . If you have any problems ask the staff they are happy to help and really want to make your stay special .
Also make use of their New Yorker Rides service (within the hotel ) its a great way to be whisked through the traffic to your airport or onward destination or even a night at the theatre when you Dont want to try flagging down a yellow cab which can be difficult when the theatres come out late on in the evening or during rush hour .

"“Very disappointed in ""suite""” For the last 4 years we have a girls vacation to NY and have stayed at the New Yorker and have always loved it, with no complaints; great location; friendly staff and love both of the restaurants in the hotel. We have had various rooms, depending on the size of our party. Last year 3 of us went and we were quite surprised at how big the room was especially for NY. This year 5 of us went and were advised we should get a suite and it would have 2 bathrooms and the suites were beautiful. VERY disappointed. The only good point was it did have 2 bathrooms, however the room we had last year was bigger than the suite. Couldn't open closet door due to fact that you had to put your suitcase on the chair because in the ""living room"" there was no place to put luggage. Had to sleep on the couch because if you opened it into a bed, you would have a hard time getting out because it takes up a good portion of the room. No alarm clock or mirror in the ""living room"", Could not control the temperature. Had to turn off the AC if you wanted it warmer.

"“Decent hotel in handy location” I've stayed in a few places in NY and this was middle of the road, decent hotel, clean and far quieter than some of the more upscale places I've experienced. 
The hotel is a little outdated, and the bathroom was, mm, interesting - definitely well equipped for people needing a little extra assistance which is thoughtful, but could use a facelift. It is in a good location, close (but not too close) to the buzz of Times Square and near Penn St station which is handy as well as all the touristy things like Empire State and hop on/hop off bus stops etc.
All the staff - except for Tony at the front desk - were helpful, friendly and chatty. Tony on the other hand was immature, rude and seemed to think that calling a guest at midnight to confirm if there was a need for 2 bookings under the same name - rather than doing it at check-in which would have been logical - was reasonable. Erm..........I would disagree, particularly after a long haul flight and crossing timezones, but Tony apparently knows best and wouldn't even entertain conversing about why this happened, or apologising for the disruption and inconvenience, he merely did the adult equivalent of stamping his foot and running to mummy (in this case the manager) who did come out and was very apologetic and like the rest of his staff, welcoming and friendly. 
The gym was a very good size, restaurant attached to the hotel was good food and the staff there were excellent - they even sang an impromptu happy birthday to one of our group which was really sweet.
All in all, one to consider for future trips if you don't want to spend a small fortune but need somewhere convenient, clean and quieter than the rest.",wrikl001,2012-09-01,122005,2012-09-25,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location.” stayed here for 4 nights mid September and very pleased with the hotel.Only down side was we had to leave 300 dollars as a bond as we did not bring a credit card.Thought this was a lot and was not informed about this by our travel agent Thomsons. The beds were very comfortable and staff very helpful.They have a free safe to use,beware of busy times on reception as you have to queue each time you wish to use it, and think this system could be improved.Some of the reception male staff had an unfriendly attitude but others were great. Its very near the station and if travelling from Heathrow to Newark easy to get the train to and a far better transport system than the UK. The service and food in the Tick Tock diner were very good and set us up for the day. The bathroom was very dated (hence the average rating )but clean and housekeeping staff very good. Staff were also good at helping us find our way round.

"“Good option, central location” The New Yorker Hotel is a good option if you want to stay for a nice price (NY-wise) in a central location. Rooms are small, but comfy and clean. You can even be lucky and get a nice view of the city from your room. The Tick Tock Diner downstairs is a nice option for trying some real american breakfast.

"“A European hotel in an American city” If you're European, then you will find this hotel to be much as you would expect to find in any major European city in the same price range.

The hotel is very well served for transport links and a lot of attractions are no more than 15-30 minutes walk if you can be bothered.
As usual, the in-room free wi-fi service is woeful, but can be upgraded to laughable for a suitably disproportionate charge; I wouldn't bother.

"“Little things spoil the experience” An old art deco style hotel in a great midtown location - Madison Square Garden & Penn Station opposite, one block to Macys and Empire State a short walk. Many of the rooms are small. Generally a good standard considering their size. However, some now beginning to show need for another re-decoration, especially bathrooms. Coopers Tavern is smart, but expensive for the mid-town area. The Tick-Tock coffee shop is always busy and reasonably priced, with swift service. On previous visits I regularly ate there. However this year the side salad option with main meals does not come with the usual American choice of dressings (Thousand Island, Italian, etc.), but a ""standard house vinaigarette"". This was the most disgusting concoction served to me anywhere in the world. I know that the two ingrediants don't naturally mix well, but this example was a foul, thick, congealed mess that looked more like chocolate sauce than a salad dressing. When I commented to my waitress, she said that ""everyone commented on how good it was"". This was despite it being untouched on all the adjacent tables. A small thing, of course, but getting the little things right can make or break your experience. As a result, I ate most meals elsewhere on this trip. Following the 2006 -10 re-furbishment, the ""official"" hotel rating went up from 2.5 stars to 4 stars (with corresponding price increase). I thought this was an exageration at the time. Now I would not rate it more than 3.5 star. I will continue to use it regularly as the location suits me. However, they do need to work hard at keeping the standard up.",Geoff C,2012-09-01,122005,2012-09-25,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The housekeeping staff are excellent also, cleaning our room everyday to a high standard and replenishing towels, etc when required. 
The location of the hotel is ideal, many attractions are a short walk away, but you also have excellent public transport links. There were plenty of great eateries close by too. 
This was our first time in New York, and as many visitors are advised ahead of visiting, very little of your time will be spent in your hotel – this is true – considering this, I would highly recommend the New Yorker as a comfortable, clean and good value (considering it’s location) hotel.

"“Great location, good hotel...a little overpriced” booked the new yorker based on the location and reviews. Paid around £210 per night (for 2 adults) we stayed i a metro room which is the cheapest one, we didn't have a view apart from the back of the building, rooms with views are extra. The room was very clea, but smal and art deco style, my biggest annoyance was the shower, you could not get the water temperature right and had to constantly keep turning the hot and cold taps up and down for it to be bearable,it was either scalding or freezing and by turning the taps you could get about a 10 second shower at a reasonable temperature! the towels were very small and toiletries not up to much. The is a good hairdryer in the bathroom and ironing board and iron is also available, our iron was leaking water and the staff promptly changed it when asked.It was very quiet most of the time and we were able to get a good nights sleep. You can print boarding passes for free at the business centre in the hotel and there is also internet access for a fee. there is a fitness suite but we didn't use this. Location wise it is great, it is in the heart of the most tourist area, times square, madison square gardens and the empire state are all within walking distance, however it is very touristy so you wouldn't want to hang around this area all the time if you wanted to get the new york vibe, but its a good base. overall it is a clean safe hotel in a good tourist location, a little over priced in my opinion, there is a subway right next to the hotel which was very convenient for us as we used it every day.

The extra we paid for it was nothing compared to the spacious room and gorgeous views. No noise issues whatsoever.

“London-fabulous holiday” I stayed here with my two daughters 3-9 September. Thanks to Mohammed at check-in we got a great room with a wonderful view.

We relied on Lonely Planet guide for restaurants and didn't go wrong once. Even managed to get tickets for an NFL game (what an experience). Highly recommend the sunrise/sunset trip up Top of the Rock though wouldn't bother with Empire State Building...too crowded and views aren't as good.

The beds were so comfie, slept great in them and the room and bathroom was spotless. Had a lovely view of the Empire State Building on my last visit.

"“Over rated, over priced , over The New Yorker” This hotel may have a bit of history and yes it is a great location but it is not a four star hotel.
The standard rooms are the smallest i have ever seen in any country. The bathrooms are very dated, baths are enamel and chipped and stained. The beds are ok but there is no room for any more than one suitcase and you have to use the very limted floor space. The rooms can not accomadate 2 persons in the same space at one time and there is no fridge, coffee maker or radio. 
Sure the hotel is old but to to rate this hotel 4 stars is being dishonest as most travellers expect certain ammneties by star ratings. I didn't choose this hotel as i stayed here by a choosing the secret Expedia deal which i will never do again as it seems ti me that this is one way to get rid of dud hotels to unexpecting travellers.
There are far better hotels for the same price in the same area so buyer beware.

"“Rude staff and don't care attitude to complaints” I have delayed posting this review despite the fact that we stayed at the New Yorker at the beginning of June 2012 because I thought it was fair to allow the hotel to address our various complaints first. We only finally achieved a vaguely satisfactory settlement on 11th September 2012 and only then after the tour operators had become directly involved so I do not feel it at all unreasonable that I should set out in detail the problems we encountered to warn others.
We travelled as a family with two teenage children and stayed there for five nights. My husband is very seriously disabled and we had gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that the room would be suitable for us and would accommodate the hoist he needs to be able to be put into bed and to use the bathroom.
The first problem was that, despite having been assured before we booked that there was a three inch gap between the bottom of our bed and the floor to allow the hoist to be used there wasn’t. In other words he was potentially stuck in his wheelchair until we went home. As he can’t move and is at risk of pressure sores this was a very serious issue. All the beds in the hotel are apparently the same and it has not been totally clear whether the fault lay with Kuoni, the tour operators, or the hotel but the New Yorker has not exactly behaved proactively about making amends since we got back. 
I eventually suggested a rollaway bed which was provided quickly and efficiently by the head of housekeeping and duty manager who were both charming and prompt. But this was not a great start and it was only my suggestion which gave us a solution to what would otherwise have been an appalling problem. It also meant that we were not able to sleep together whilst we were away and the space to move around in the room was much restricted by the rollaway bed.
The wheel in shower room smelled of damp and the hotel itself looks shabby in parts. I woke up with a number of bites every morning and I notice that another reviewer made the same complaint about a stay at about the same time. Subsequently the hotel produced a bed bug report showing no infestation but it begs the question of what was biting me.
There are no safety/security boxes in the rooms meaning a wait at the front desk every time I wanted to access the box.
There is a major issue also with the front desk and the staff there. There was nearly always a queue at Reception to check in/access security boxes. I waited up to ten minutes to get access to my box and another ten minutes to return my passport. The behaviour of some of the front desk staff was curt and surly although some were very pleasant. One however by the name of Samira (as I subsequently discovered) was the rudest person I have ever met in a public service position. She was offhand and brusque with me telling me to “Get in line” if I wanted to access my security box. Whilst I was waiting (ten minutes) I saw her wave back a group waiting to check in as they were coming forward, barking “Get back I’ll call you when I’m ready”. No please or pleasantry. An elderly Japanese lady was trying to get some attention and she shouted at her to get back to the end of the line nearly yelling “Nobody is going to help you. Wait your turn!”
I was eventually assisted by another member of the front desk and when I was alone with her I asked if this person always behaved like that. I was told – amidst nervous giggling- “I don’t want to comment” but I did establish what her name was which I wouldn’t otherwise have known because she wasn’t wearing a name badge.
I saw the Duty Manager and complained and he said he would attend to it or words to that effect. As I was leaving speaking to him Samira gazed at me in a disrespectful and hostile manner. She did this again when I saw her the next day when she was again not wearing her name badge. In fact I never saw her wear the badge.
I set out all of the above complaints in a letter to Mrs. Lima the owner and operator of the hotel with my feedback form. I included my contact details but it was only when I took it up through Ramada that I was contacted by the hotel. It was however confirmed that Mrs. Lima had had my original letter but nothing had been done about it. Emails about all of this went forward and back for a long time resulting in the hotel offering - to start with - some free of charge accomodation ""on our next stay"". I pointed out we were not going to be visting them again even if we returned to New York so this was changed to one night's refund for rudeness and inconvenience but with a denial of any blame in respect of the bed problem. I was however told some time ago by the Guest Services Manager that Samira is one of their most highly decorated staff members!! I note that unflattering comments have also been made about her by other recent reviewers.
Our very helpful travel agent then did her best to help and as a result of this a further offer appeared to have been made by the front of house manager Matt Slippoy.I emailed him about the offer on 4th September 2012 The email was not even acknowledged let alone answered. A final settlement has now been reached but via Kuoni with no direct word from the hotel.
Good things are the location and Coopers Tavern which is excellent but if you have any kind of special needs or just want consistently courteous service from the front staff, let alone if you expect legitimate complaints to be resolved quickly then avoid this place like the plague",Mary B,2012-06-01,122005,2012-09-13,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Loved this Place! Great Stay!” We stayed at the New Yorker hotel for 9 days in June. The hotel was really easy to get to from New Jersey Liberty (EWR) airport via the Air train that goes to Union Station. The hotel was about ½ a block away from the station. Getting around downtown was a piece of cake. The subway is on the corner. Times Square and Broadway shows were within walking distance. 
Our room on the 35th floor had an outstanding view; the Empire State and Chrysler buildings out one window and downtown with the new WTC building. We never tired of looking at that view and took countless pics. The room was small, like hotel rooms in Europe generally are, but it was well-organized so that we could move around easily.

Walking distance to Broadway, Tmies Square, restaurants, subway, generally most of the major sights. As our travel agent booked us Run of House, perhaps check what room is allocated.

"“Amazing service, MILITARY FRIENDLY” Let me begin by saying I cannot thank The New Yorker enough for the very generous 20% off for military members. My husband is in the service (Air Force) and we were in NJ visiting family, we deciede to have a 'mommy and daddy' night in NYC while family watched our son. We chose The New Yorker because of the prime location and for their discount. I can say without a doubt, the stay was worth the money..and then some more. 
We arrived early, so we left our bags so we could explore the city for a bit (free by the way). When we did check in at 3, my husband and I had the most amazing service from Mohammed (REMEMBER THAT NAME!). Arriving at the room, I was so suprised at how much room we had! We had a wonderful view of the Hudson River, the bed was so comfortable, the room and bathroom was clean and tidy. Shortly after, Mohammed called to see if we were happy with our accomidations (We were). I loved everything about this hotel, and I hope we can stay again soon. I plan on telling all my military friends and family to stay at The New Yorker should they get a chance to stay in NYC.

"“Great location, great views, great rooms” We spent three nights during which it felt like home, it was so comfortable. We arrived from Newark airport, which was convenient as the hotel is right there when you cross onto the island. The front desk was efficient. We had an executive suite on the 38th floor. It had a six-seat dining table, couch and chairs, two bathrooms and a separate bedroom. And a balcony! With views of the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building (my fav :). The main focus of our trip was to go to some Broadway shows, and this was a great location for that as all the Theatres are within walking distance. It's also right beside a subway station so it's easy to get anywhere in Manhattan. We had continental breakfast on the 39th floor sky lounge which was very convenient as I am always extremely hungry as soon as I wake up!

"“Fantastic New York expierence” What can I say about the New Yorker… this is the 14th US hotel that we’ve stayed in for leisure during the past 12 months, and it was by far and away the best!
We arrived after a long flight from the UK and were greeted very warmly by Ana. They had our original request for a high room on file, and not only did they honour it, but also gave us a free upgrade from a View room to a corner View Deluxe. 
The room itself was reasonably sized for Manhattan (where the rooms are usually smaller than elsewhere in the US), clean and well fitted out with flatscreen TV with cable, bath/shower etc. I believe they have been recently refurbished, and are blessed with a quiet and modern air conditioning unit – something that so many other American hotels lack. We paid the extra for a view room, and boy was it worth it. We had a full-length view of the Empire State Building from the windows on one side of the room, and from the other a view of One World Trade Center, the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson. We could spend hours just looking out those windows! There is also free WiFi throughout the hotel. 
The hotel retains its original 1930s Art Deco style and much of its original charm. If you want a modern glass and steel building then look somewhere else. It’s located a comfortable 10 minute walk from the hyperactivity of Times Square, and is just a block from Macy’s (ladies!). Penn Station opposite provides convenient access to the Metro and transport to JFK. The diner next door does great breakfasts, if you have a large appetite.

"“Impressive Art Deco Hotel” Location of this hotel for Manhattan is excellent. Substation is just across the road with many connections. Times Square is about 10 minutes walk away. The hotel is a little tired with the decor but it is to be expected as it is an old art deco building. When you are in the lobby - LOOK UP! its amazing. 
The room we were given was quite small but functional. The view was nothing to be excited about but it was quiet which was the main thing. 
Food at the tick tock diner next door was nice and the guy at the desk dealing with transfers was really helpful. 
Our only complaint was the woman at the concierge desk. We turned up there on the day after we arrived to book some tickets for the usual attractions, the light was on, but there was no one at the desk. There is a little ATM touchscreen looking machine in the same space as the concierge desk so while we waited we had a play on that and bought our tickets for the circle line tour via this, really easy to use. At this point the woman came backt to her desk and said to us: ""why have you used the machine?! You should have waited for me to come back!"" She obviously gets paid commission on selling the tours. I replied to her that without a notice saying that she would be back soon, why would we wait for her. Very rude. Subsequently we avoided speaking to her about any other trips and sorted everything ourselves. 
A really good tip that I must pass on to anyone visiting NYC is Big Apple Greeter:

"“Location!” The best thing about this hotel is its location! Very conveniently situated in the heart of manhattan. Subway and penn station are 1 block away.
In essence this hotel should be split up in different sections so it would be able to cater for different demands... Now it is just a mastodont that delivers rather bland rooms and basic service.
 But as far as businesstrips go... If you have a reasonably up to date bathroom, clean sheets, industrial size ac... One is happy?
Kudos for the curly haired weekday concierge who saved me 60 dollars on a broadway show. The hotel can only sell premium tickets. I bought them myself saved a buck and was seated 5 rows of the stage! ( brilliant seats)

The room was very pleasant, well renovated and comfortable for the purpose of a place to stay when spending most of your time out and about.

“In need of a little TLC but great location” We booked a suite which comprised a bedroom with 2 large beds an ensuite a living room with extra sink & fridge and an additional toilet. Great for 4 girls - we had plenty of space to sit and have a drink whilst inspecting our purchases. The room was very clean but was a bit dog eared and could do with a bit of refurbishment. Breakfast was available in the TickTock diner - this was fairly busy in the mornings as it was frequented by non-residents as well as those staying at the hotel. that said the food was good and the menu whilst not particularly extensive had enough on it to satisfy our requirements. the location of the hotel was great - just across the road from Madison Square Gardens and the main train & subway links. Only downside to our experience was that the check in staff were not particularly pleasant or helpful and the concierge was hardly ever there !,belfastgirl007,2012-07-01,122005,2012-09-06,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

All staff were very friendly and helpful from, security, reception, concierge, door men and cleaners. Rooms were cleaned every day! We were on the 40th floor, a suite, room was basic but had all your needs, the view was amazing from here!! Worth the extra money even if only for the view!

"“Fantastic - dream come true” We stayed here for a week in July for our honeymoon. Everything was great from the moment we arrived - we had asked for a room with a view of the Empire State before we travelled and had been told that there would be a small daily uplift for this (which we'd agreed to pay) but the receptionist (without being asked) saw that it was our honeymoon, waived the charge and upgraded us to a better room which had an absolutely stunning view of the Empire State and Midtown. We were also given some chocolates, which was a nice touch.
The hotel has so much character - proper art deco building, so at times it kind of felt like staying in a tourist attraction (in a good way). The Tick Tock diner is fantastic - open 24 hours, enormous portions and delicious satisfying food, just what we needed after long days pounding the streets and late nights out! The bar, Coopers Tavern, is also good - we ate there one night and the food was perfectly decent, but we had a cocktail/beer in there most days before going out as it had a good atmosphere, seemed quite a few locals called in for a drink after work.
Before we went, we'd read a few reviews on here complaining about the staff. All we can say is that wasn't our experience - they were pleasant, helpful and in most cases quite chatty. Given that the building is a star in itself and the location is fantastic, this was just perfect for us.

"“The New Yorker Hotel” This was my first time in New York and I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel. I was attracted to the hotel because of its history and location.

I am disabled (wheelchair) and the hotel staff were very helpful and the room i stayed in was very accessible. They would go out of their way to make sure i was satisfied. The hotel has two restaurants which provide great food and service. They also have a transportation service that was very helpful and provided me access to go anywhere in the city. I can not say enough about this hotel and New York City. Nothing i had heard was accurate, the people and the atmosphere are awesome. And for someone that is disabled and faced with challenges everyday this is one of the most accessible cities i have ever been to, and the people show respect and generous hospitality to the disabled.

The room we had was small but it had 2 double beds which were unbelievably comfortable. The climate control kept the room cool and the bathroom was clean and adequate.

"“Good location, but can be modernised” We spent three nights at the hotel. Overall, the location is great. You are few minutes walk away from Times square, Macy's and other major tourist attractions. 
The rooms could be better particularly the toilets. The sink was clogged and they are marks and scratches inside the toilet- the paint has come out- so looks a bit unpleasant. 
They have a gym in the basement- reasonably well equipped but having showers around the area would be great.

"“great place, great accommodations, great view, very clean rooms” The New Yorker was a great hotel in a great place in the garment district and only a block from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.
We checked in and a room wasn't ready so we got an upgrade to a great suite on the 38th floor with an amazing eastern view of the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building etc- a totally unobstructed 180 degree view!
Service was very nice in all respects and never had to wait more than 30 seconds for an elevator.
Breakfast was included and the continental breakfast is very good and well stocked with fruits and pastries and such.

"“Period Busy City Hotel” 6 of us had 4 days here in 3 rooms, two of the rooms were small and needed repairs, television, plumbing and door fittings, the staff (who are very good) did change the rooms for us and did the repairs quickly, so my impression is that unless you are careful, they will give the grot rooms out first to fill all the rooms if they can, so complain if you have to it will work. The rooms could do with things like clothes hooks in the bath room and bed room also a kettle .
Not all the rooms have a good view and some of them are very noisy, not only from the street, but also from the Hotel itself . 
We used the Hotels Tic-Toc Diner for breakfast and the odd evening meals, we all recommend it for the american food experience, the staff are very good.

Our room on the 37th floor had the most amazing views of the Empire State Building and Crysler Building, facing both East and North. Great location, walkable to so many sights: Times Sq and ESB etc. Ticktock Diner is so useful with a great selection and service. Problems: when checking in we were told money for the room was taken when checking-out and there were no other fees to be paid, when I checked my balance that evening, the money for room had been taken along with a deposit! We were not told about the deposit! Therefore I was down $270 for the week, this was hugely inconvenient. We spoke to the manager the next day who said we should have been told about this, but there was nothing he could do and he would speak to his staff about the bad service.

"“Great holiday location” We stayed on a very busy week in March, 5 nights, including St. Patrick's Day. 5 of us stayed, 2 in a regular room, and 3 others in a larger suite. The typical US thing of 2 double beds in a twin room meant the room was made smaller than it really was ( in the regular room), the larger room was fine. Having said that, we didn't come to New York to hang out in our rooms, so the only problem was finding somewhere to stow our purchases!
The bathroom was not the most modern, but very clean and adequate, the shower had a very annoying habit of going cold suddenly. The bathroom had no window. The tv was overly complicated to set up, there were also pay-per-view movies etc. Our room had no view to speak of, it would be nice; but again, we didn't come to New York to gaze out our window, so not really important.
The other room was slightly bigger as we mentioned, with a small closet, which would be good for storing suitcases etc. Also the view was better, nothing special, but the fact that buildings weren't in such close proximity meant the room was brighter. Plus the bathroom had a window.
The hotel diner was ok, I had breakfast there one morning. American breakfasts are legendary, and a good reason to spoil yourself, but I would not recommend this diner as a breakfast destination. The food is ok, but a lot of it is only average, and the coffee is weak.
The hotel staff were very nice and friendly, cleanliness was great.
The location is very good, especially for first-time visitors to New York, as it is less than a ten minute walk to Times Square/ Empire State/ Grand Central Station etc.Madison Square Garden is right across the street. Macy's is two minutes down the road. Across the road there is a Starbucks and a McDonalds if you need a fast food fix, but the area around Times Square is teeming with lots of places to eat anyhow. There is a subway close by.
Overall, it is a good place to stay if you want be close to Times Square and branded shopping, however, for boutique/alternative shopping, real coffee , nice parks and great music venues- head to East Village area.

"“Great location, great hotel!” I stayed here on my recent visit to NYC on business (6 nights) and was very pleasantly surprised by my visit. Located just 2 street blocks from Penn Station, the hotel was very conveniently located to public transit, which makes getting in from any of the area's airports very easy! In my case, I arrived at Newark and was at the hotel within 30 minutes of my arrival into NYC using NJTransit. Macy's at Herald Square was only a few avenues away, as was the Empire State Building, and Times Square was easily within walking distance. Highline Park wasn't far, either, and if you're interested in Central Park, it was a bit of a trek, but definitely doable (I regard NYC as a very walkable city).
I arrived at just about the start of check-in, and it took quite a while to get through the line. The staff was pleasant, though. Once checked-in, though, I went upstairs, found my room and was pleasantly surprised at the size of my accommodations. I received a Double room and the footprint of the room was much larger than any other room I've stayed at in NYC in recent history. There was a desk, two closets, two chairs and a coffee table. 
The bathroom, however, was quite small and a bit on the noisy side. The toilet was one of the loudest toilets I've ever heard, and if you're neighbor is showering, you can hear their shower coming through the walls (I assume we shared a wall in the bathroom). There was excellent water pressure, though, and the soaps/amenities were restocked daily.
Aside from the bathroom, though, the room was fabulous. Despite being sold out for the duration of our stay, the room was quiet and I rarely heard a peep from my neighbors, aside from their shower. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean, too!
Food options nearby are plentiful. I would suggest the Hourglass Tavern (46th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues) for a cheap-ish night out (less than $20/person). There is also a Starbucks right across the street, as well as a number of diners, fast food joints and restaurants lining 8th Avenue. For the theater-goer, Broadway and off-Broadway plays are at your doorstep -- you're never more than a few blocks away from the next great show (but your tickets at the TKTS booth in Times Square on the day of the performance!).

"“not dirty, doesn't feel dangerous, good water pressure, good gym...” ...Otherwise, I would skip it. As other reviewers noted, the walls are paper thin (I am there at this moment and the shower from next door is so loud I feel it will leak into my room)! Similarly a few minutes ago, neighbors on the other side returned to their room and their entry was so loud I wondered for a minute if they were trying to get into mine!
The property, while it appears to be basically clean, is very, very old. Such that in my room, there is a total of 1 electric outlets, which has two sockets, near the floor across from the bed. None in the bathroom. As others noted, also there is an absence of any reasonable shelf space in the bathroom (as in, like zero...), there is no coffee maker, the mini-bar is empty, and when i went to use the safe in the room, there was a note that it was broken. There appears to be a very think ""duvet layer"" of some sort nestled between flat sheets, but there are no blankets to speak of, not on the bed, and not in the closet. The closet contains a total of about 9 hangers (I think three are pants/skirts hangers). While internet access is free on rooms to get ""high speed"" internet, you have to pay. (All things considered, couldn't they offer just one break? I am now listening to another shower and/or sink activities next door, seriously right behind my head.)
I booked my reservation here thru Guestmob, which I had heard about online from some friends. I was disappointed to end up at this hotel in the first place, since the others listed in the same ""suite"" of hotels that they were offering in and around this neighborhood, generally appear newer, hipper, cleaner, and more interesting. (You pay up front and the guarantee that their rate is much lower than others and you can cancel within about 72 hours or so of your booking once you find out- exactly one week before you go- where you are staying but by that point, awfully hard to find good deals in places like NYC.) Also, I didn't realize until digging around for more info about Guestmob, that there is no guarantee that the entire group of hotels that they list in a given suite, are available for a given week. Thus while the rate that I got to stay here appeared good when I was envisioning myself at one of the other locations, it wasn't particularly competitive at this hotel (in fact there are prices listed on the inside of my door here that suggest one could stay here for $30 less per night, depending...). I am paying $178 a night (before tax) and while I wouldn't necessarily feel as badly about staying here if I had actively chosen this location myself, probably I never would have if I hadn't used Guestmob and my sense now is that the ""shiny, happy, prettier"" options that they list on their site might not be the ones to which they send their travelers most frequently, because they probably make more off bookings at other hotels like this one (which should seriously be considered more of a 2 star experience, at least compared to other hotels in the U.S.). I won't use Guestmob again, nor will I stay here. I am hoping to at least get a little bit of sleep eventually.
Having said that, mostly the front desk folks have been friendly and I am looking forward to using the gym tomorrow.",corinne b,2012-08-01,122005,2012-08-31,False,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great place to stay!” This was our first trip to NY for my daughter and I. We stayed for 5 nights. We wanted an older style hotel with character that is well maintained. The New Yorker fits that perfectly. Check in was fast and easy. Knowing that we had a small ""metro"" room I was expecting it to be tiny. Yes, it was small but not as small as expected and with 2 double beds we were able to manage quite nicely. (it was exactly as pictured on the web site). We were pleasantly surprised to have a view of the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building out our window. We were on the 35th floor and although there was some street noise (like sirens) it was very quiet, the beds firm but comfortable. It was never a problem waiting for elevators as there are so many and security staff always checked our room key before we got on the elevators.The staff were always friendly and helpful when we asked for assistance. The location couldn't have been better. We used the subway and all the stops were an easy walk away. Time square and many attractions were also easy to walk to.The area isn't as busy late at night, but even returning after midnight we always felt safe. There are several eateries close by. We really enjoyed our stay at the New Yorker and hope to return soon.",anira160,2012-08-01,122005,2012-08-30,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Great location” This was a decent mid range hotel in NYC. You should expect a clean room and accessibility to anything you could think to do in the city. The subway is right next door as is a diner with decent food (only eat there if you're in a pinch though-- there are FAR better places to eat nearby). The hotel staff is friendly but it took an act of congress to get a new room key made. The rooms have modern amenities and were well appointed. I would stay here again if I needed economical accommodations with a great location. For the single girl-- I did not see any security cameras in the hallways back near the room we stayed in. This was really my only concern as we were in the farthest corner of the hotel with a long walk to and from the elevator.,Maggie R,2012-08-01,122005,2012-08-30,True,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Ideal for arrivals via Penn Station. Great location, great view.” This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel. We were upgraded to a ""view room"" (room 3717), which had spectacular views of the skyline, including the Empire State Building and the Crysler building. The room was small, but I was there to sight-see, not lounge in my hotel room - and the location and view made up for the small size anyway! 
We arrived via Penn Station, so we only had a very short walk to the hotel with our luggage. Our room wasn't ready, but it was before check-in time, so this wasn't unexpected. The staff was curteous and helpful, checking our luggage and giving us some directions. When we checked out, the bell staff even checked a flower in a small vase for us while we finished our sight-seeing.
Hint: This is a VINTAGE hotel. Expect it to be older (smaller elevators, rooms, etc.) It is well maintained and has a lot of character. I personally prefer a vintage feel. Beautiful grand chandelier in lobby.
My only small complaint is that the bathroom could use some renovation, as the tile grout is stained, which doesn't give the impression of spotlessly clean. That said, the room (including the bathroom) was very clean and comfortable.

"“Characterful and great location” I'm really pleased overall with this hotel. Firstly arriving - from JFK it's really easy to get to via subway. Just take the Airtrain to the Howard Beach station ($5, you pay when you arrive at Howard Beach), and then get the subway (the A train, $2.50) straight into Manhattan - the hotel is literally outside the subway entrance. Having witnessed the busy roads around the hotel, I'd say this was a much less stressful route to the hotel than via taxi or shuttlebus!
The location is great, you're right in the middle of the hustle of the city. It's just a couple of blocks from Times Square and the Empire State, and also within easy walking of the Circle Line boat tours which depart from the pier at the end of 42nd street - I did the 3 hour circular tour of Manhattan on my first afternoon there to familiarise myself with everything, and can highly recommend it. The Tick Tock diner that's connected to the hotel is great, has all the American classics like pancakes, waffles, egg creams, mac'n'cheese, burgers etc - and there's also plenty of convenience stores, starbucks, pizza places, dunkin donuts and loads more right outside the door.
In terms of the hotel itself - really nice lobby, friendly and welcoming staff. The room was on the small side but had a bath (great for soaking aching legs after all that walking) and was art deco-styled. It wasn't all shiny/contemporary decor that you see in chain hotels and, though it looked like it had seen fresh paint recently, it was a little worn in some places, but I actually really liked this as it had lots of character and history. One tip - take earplugs. I heard no noise at all from adjoining rooms, but the traffic is noisy right through the night as the drivers seem to beep their horns at just about anything! I had to spend one night without earplugs as I'd booked an early tour and needed to hear my alarm, and didn't really sleep that night because of this. The other slight issue I have is that the hotel charges $1 per item of luggage that you want to store with them on your check-out day. Although this is a small amount, I do feel this should be complementary at a 4* hotel and I've never had to pay for this at a non-budget hotel before. Overall, I'd really recommend this hotel for it's unique character, friendliness and location.",jaynie111,2012-08-01,122005,2012-08-30,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Location, location” Excellent location; central Manhattan, stones throw from Empire State & Penn station with lovely 1920's decor & friendly staff BUT cannot get over the fact that you can pay $250 for a tiny room which has no mini bar, room service or water provided (or view of Empire State we were meant to have). Arrived after midnight from UK & woke up at 5am, dragged my jet lagged self & friend round various floors looking for ""soda machines"" which were only source of water available - they were only on some of the floors and we eventually worked out that you needed single dollar notes to purchase it. Stayed in many 4* hotels in UK & abroad and never had this ever, not sure why they did not tell us when we checked in.

"“First trip to NYC!!” We stayed here for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon, neither of us had been to NY before so didn't quite know what to expect. The hotel was pretty central for most tourist attrations, with Macy's and the Empire State no more than a 10 minute walk! The room was small and as we were travelling on to Mexico we had 2 very large suitcases to climb over everytime we went out the door but as it was only for 4 days so we didn't have a major issue. All we wanted was clean, central and friendly which The New Yorker definitely was! Tick Tock diner was pretty good too, we went twice for breakfast and we weren't disappointed!

The Hotel has an old style charm, very New York, The staff were helpful, we had a great time.

"“Good value - disappointing service” We stayed at the New Yorker Aug 6th through 11th. The hotel is situated a little farther south than I would have preferred, but the price was right and it included complimentary wifi and a breakfast. 
I'll get the bad over with first. The front desk is deplorable. My daughter attempted to check us in as she was first to arrive, and even though I had pre-warned them with an email and had a positive response back, she was still told she could not check in. It was getting late at night and I was held up in another city with delayed flights. After she called me, I had to call the hotel and I did manage to get it straightened out. But first impressions are everything.
The next day our ""keys"" did not work, and we headed back down to the front desk. The man there took my id and keys and after a few minutes informed me that we were not to keep them near our cell phones as they had been deactivated. I don't even think he looked at me once. So its these impressions that last, and I'm sorry to say that they overshadowed all the good.
The lobby is very nice and open. The information desk was helpful and pleasant. They check all guests at the elevator for keys, which gives you a sense of security. Our room was on the 36th floor overlooking the Hudson. It was well appointed and very clean. The bathrooms are outdated and there are no fans but otherwise it was fine. I must say the beds are super comfortable and I think I had one of the best sleeps ever travelling. Pillows super comfy. It was quiet - no street noise and no noisy neighbours.
The hotel is well within walking distance to Times Square, Macy's and The Empire State Building. There is a 24 hour pharmacy across the street and the subway stns are close by. 
We ate at the TicToc Diner a couple of times for convenience. The food was average and no complaints - exactly what we would expect from a diner.
I had no problems with settling the bill a day early. Angel on the front desk was great and he helped me organize a town car for my 4am ride to La Guardia Airport.
So, all in all, it was really good value. If it hadn't been for the initial negative experiences with the front desk, I think I would have rated it a bit higher. Still it was a good trip and if you can get the discounted price at this hotel, it is worth saving the extra money.",Lois2011,2012-08-01,122005,2012-08-14,False,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“The New Yorker -perfect” Stayed September 2011 for 4 nights and thought it was fantastic , flew in from Belfast to Newark and quick train change and we were at Penn station , which is very close to the New Yorker. Hotel reception busy but that wasn't a problem , staff were very friendly and there manners were second to none. Room was a bit small , but we were there to see New York not the room . Back to the room , it was brilliantly decorated with modern fittings but it also retained some older features which mixed well. The bed did ruin one of our nights , we were out shopping and came back and went for a nap before dinner , well it was so comfortable I slept right through to 4a.m :) .

"“Decent, clean, good value” This is an older hotel in the Garment district, about a 10 minute walk from Times Square. The Lobby and other common areas are clean and elegant, elevators are fast and frequent. There are some neat deco details throughout the hotel, most original, it looked like. The suite we had featured a living area with a mini-fridge and sofa bed and a bedroom with 2 double beds. All beds, including the sofa bed, were very comfortable with tempur-pedic type mattresses. The bedroom and living area were both small, but fine for a short stay. There was a large entry way with a 2 closets, one of them quite large. Our room had a great view of the Empire State building and also had a large terrace, (which had no furniture, so you couldn't really use it) The only negative was the bathroom, which was very small, though clean. We were told the room was a ""renovated"" room, though I would call it more of a redecoration than a renovation as there were definite signs of age in the bath area. 
Continental breakfast is available for the concierge/corporate level rooms and has a good variety of cereals, pastries and fruit and the view from the dining area is fabulous, though seating is limited. The Tick-Tock diner in the lobby of the hotel was actually quite good and reasonably priced. Across the street is a Starbucks and in the other direction, a good restaurant, Lucy's, which features Mexican and has good Margaritas, though they don't allow kids after 5 PM. 
Hotel is very close to Penn Station, less than a 3 minute walk. You can leave your luggage for $1/bag after you check out.

“Small rooms....but very comfertable” Came here after two weeks in florida and it was a bit of a culture shock. Very busy hotel with people coming and going all the time and there was a latin music conference going on when we were there.

"“great hotel with great staff!” Spent 7 nights at the new yorker and it was a very pleasant stay. Great friendly staff, great location (close to penn station and times square) and we got a great view from our window!

"“Loved it!” This was our first trip to The States, and we went to celebrate my wifes 50th. Yes the rooms are small, yes maybe the decor is a little tired ( but I still loved the Art Deco style, and the building itself looks fantastic), and while the staff weren't over the top attentive, (which I find annoying anyway), they were perfectly competent. We did pay 10 dollars extra to have a room with a view of The Empire State, and were a little disapointed that the bed faced the opposite way to the view, but that is a minor gripe.
Reading other reviews on here, I get the impression if you regularly enjoy 5 star hotels, and enjoy fawning staff and immaculate rooms, then this probably isn't the place for you. However, if you are an everyday couple, with a relaxed attitude to life and like to enjoy yourself- then stay here!
The location is fantastic, you can walk to Times Square within 10 minutes, The Empire State in five, Maceys in two minutes and Madison Square Garden in about 30 seconds! Loved the Tick Tock diner which is attached to the hotel, and we had breakfast there every day.
I would love to be able to visit New York again some day, and if I do, this hotel would be my first choice.",Rex L,2012-06-01,122005,2012-08-07,False,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“New Yorker Hotel - Felt like home for 9 nights” We are so happy for having chosen this hotel for our 9 night stay in NYC!
Before I enter into detail, a couple of things: We got a summer deal for our dates with a discount (on the hotel's site) and we stayed at a Tower Suite (which are huge).
Let's start with the reservation process. We did it on line, perfectly. Then we managed our reservation through Nicole, who did an excelent Job. We even asked for a room with balcony (for which we paid extra), and had it just like we wanted.
We arrived really early, so our room was not ready. Kept our luggage in the hotel's luggage room, and headed out.
When we came back, check in was fast, and at this point we had our only problem with this hotel: The breakfast. The reservation details stated that continental breakfast was included. Being there we learned that from Mon-Fri it was served on the 39th floor, while on weekends, at the Tick Tock dinner. We travelled with our 2 girls (3 and 7), and for the Tick Tock they gave us vouchers, but only for adults. I said I could share with my 3 yo, but my older daughter needed to have breakfast. Besides, if they could have breakfast from Mon to Fri, why not on weekends? Long story short, they issued a set of voucher for my older daughter. More on the breakfast later... The promo also included a couple of welcome drinks. :-)
Now, the room: We were given room # 3808. When we stepped down from the elevator we realized it was a corner room, and when we opened the door we could not believe the size of the living room. It was huge, with a huge diner table and 6 chairs, a desk, a Flat TV, a wet bar, a sofa bed, integrated refrigerator and lots of room! There was a door to a bathroom.
Two doors led to the bedroom, which had a bathroom and another flat TV. The room is also equiped with a safe.
Both bathrooms were very clean and beautiful with marble all over the place.
Finally, the windows. We had lots of windows, and when we looked through the door to the balcony, there it was: The Empire State, which is 3 avenues away. A perfect unblocked view. When we could stop looking at it we realized that we could also see the Chrysler, Downtown, the Hudson River and at night the reflection of Times Square's lights. Just sitting on the balcony (which had a table and chairs) at night, having a drink and looking at all those wonderful lit buildings, was breathtaking.
Moving forward, the basics:
The location was perfect. All subway access (Penn Station is incredible). 34th St is awesome in terms of walking and shopping (Kmart, Macy's, Duane Reade, Party City, to name a few). A nice walk to Times Square, and a longer one (but doable) to Central Park.
The hotel lobby is simply gorgeous, and the hotel on its outside is a beautiful building.
The room, and the hotel in general was very clean and very tidy. Every single person working there was really corteous and friendly.
Both the living room and the bedroom had independent temperature control. The fridge had a really nice size, not the mini bars where you can hardly put a couple of cans. We stuffed it to the top and everything was cold.
The water temperature and pressure were fantastic. We even had bath simultaneously in the two bathrooms without problems.
Despite the 40 floors and quantity of rooms, we've never had a long wait for an elevator. Half went from Ground Floor to the 20th and the other half from 20th to 40th.
We had some packages delivered from Amazon and they received it without problems. In fact, a couple arrived prior to our check in, and they received them anyway. The people at the mail room were very friendly.
We had complimentary wi fi with very good signal all over the room.
I've read some reviews were people were annoyed by having to show the key to the security people to enter the elevator lobby. For the record, I did not find it disturbing at all, always had my key ready, and the guards were really friendly. In fact we thought that this requirement was for the benefit of all guests.
Tick tock dinner: It is not part of the hotel, but it has a connecting door. We had breakfast here on weekends (to go, and took it to our room), and had dinner 3 or 4 nights (again, take away to our room). Simply good prices, good food, good quantity. Our girls are very hard to please when we travel, related to food, but once they tried the food from the Tick Tock, they asked us to buy there again. Every dish we tried could be shared by 2 people.
Now, the breakfast issue. Let's start by saying that I understand that it is not very common in NYC to have breakfast included with your room. I think it was offered to the upper floors. The room where it was served, the sky lounge (perfect name for awesome views) was not big, but it served its purpose. The problem was that there was only one person to clean, replenish, bring coffee and beverages. And you have to be there early, because at some point, some things were over for the day (bagels were gone fast). Or you could be let there waiting for a table until you were cleared to go in. This situation, while not a deal breaker by any means, should be addressed by the management, because I think that adding a couple of persons to serve breakfast, and having all the items available until breakfast time is over, could solve the problem.
All in all, a great experience. Nice clean hotel, Friendly staff, in our case a huge room and awesome view, and great service from check in to check out.
It is also fair to mention that we used the New Yorker Rides to go from and to JFK and the service was excelent, with very friendly drivers and always on time.
Totally recommended!!!

"“Great location” We were very happy with our stay at The New Yorker. The location is great! Penn Station is down the street. It is very close to Times Square. We walked there and felt safe day and night. The Empire State building is a few blocks away and we could see it from our room. We had a view room
with 2 beds. The size of the room was good. The bathroom was small and could use some work but it was clean. The front desk staff was very helpful. If you are driving there it is hard to find a space to park for valet. We had to drive around 5 times before a space was available.

"“Worst Check-In Agent Ever” I stayed at this hotel right after a wonderful time at another New York hotel in walking distance; but I can say that my experience here was the polar opposite at The New Yorker.
 When I arrived at the front desk, I was greeted....wait, actually I was waved over by the agent's wiggling index finger. I saw that her name was ""Siemira"" or something like that. She just blurted out ""NAME"". I responded to her question (?). She gave a obvious sigh of frustration, and asked for ID. I passed that on as well, and not once during this excruciating process was I ever welcomed or even acknowledged beyond a barbaric level. 
The check in alone was horrid enough that it already defeated my experience. The hallways and rooms kind of look like a low rent apartment building that has not been renovated since the '70s. They are serviceable, but this is listed as being a 4-star hotel on several websites. I really am not that picky, so long if the room is comfortable; but some truck stops are more appealing than this place. The room was definitely fine to sleep in. The room was clean, although it did need some maintenance (toilet paper holder was falling off the wall, missing bathroom tiles). The location is good, right on Penn station across the street from Madison Square Gardens. 
On the second day, I requested a cot, and the woman who checked me in was working again. I was afraid to speak to her. this time she was counting cash and I had to say ""excuse me"" quite loudly for her to even look up. I asked if I could get a cot to the room, she angrily said that there is a $25 fee. I was fine with that, but she kept on arguing as if I was not aware there is a fee (must be a natural defense mechanism). I clarified that it was okay, and she said it would be arriving in the room. 3 hours later, still no cot. I went downstairs, and another agent was (thankfully) working. He said that the room may be to small for a cot, but housekeeping would measure it to make sure. The cot never did arrive during the stay.
 I did complain at front desk upon check-out, and the friendly agent working apologized. At least they did not charge for the cot. The other staff I encountered where pleasant. The housekeepers where fantastic and very friendly. They should be working at front desk.
Frankly, my review would have been much better (maybe a 3) if it was not for Siemira at check in. The way she behaved is totally unacceptable for a parking toll booth; never mind a ""4-star"" hotel.",Scona,2012-08-01,122005,2012-08-05,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Hotel in NYC!” My husband and I spent last night at The New Yorker Hotel on 34th and were pleasantly surprised. I had found a deal on Travelzoo that gave us a room with a view (gorgeous views of the Hudson River!) and breakfast at the hotel's Tic Toc Diner. The hotel has been restored to resemble its infancy days in the 1920s. The decor is spot on. Rooms are rather small, but there was still plenty of room to get around. The courteous front desk staff allowed us to check in at 11:00 a.m., which was great. All was spotless. The bathroom was quite nice (very deep tub!) but the sink could have used a ledge or somewhere to put your make-up/toothbrush/tooth paste while you were using them. The hotel has over 900 rooms and I was surprised at how good the water pressure was in the shower. From the hotel, we were able to easily walk to the theatre to see ""Once"" (highly recommended). If in the area, stop by John's Pizzaria on 44th--you get a very reasonably priced meal before seeing a show and the restaurant is in a restored church. The security in the hotel was very good, with a gentleman checking room keys prior to allowing access to the elevators. We noticed a plethora of different languages being spoken so the hotel must be a favorite with the international set. We had a cocktail at the attached Cooper's Tavern and while we didn't eat there, the food looked very good. We walked a few doors down from the hotel to eat at Tir Na Nog, a highly recommended Irish restaurant and bar. Breakfast was included with the room price, which was a bonus. I do think, however, it was unfair to limit the times you could use the breakfast coupons to between the hours of 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. Check out time at the hotel is a generous 12 p.m. and it would have been nice to be able to sleep in. The hotel is located right near Penn Station, which made taking the train into the city an easy, stressfree way to get there!

The hotel offers free internet, but should also offer guests free access to the computers. As it is now, you have to pay a fee to use the computers.

"“Brilliant hotel and stay” This hotel is great, it's a gorgeous huge building and the reception area is impressive but also welcoming.
We were on Honeymoon from the UK and got to the hotel at about midnight, check-in was easy and the room was nice, a bit small but I think that is expected in New York unless you pay thousands for a suite. The room had everything you needed, the bathroom was small and compact. The view was of the Hudson River which was lovely. We arrived exhausted straight from the airport and very hungry and ordered room service, the hotel don't have their own room service but the restaurant 'Tick Tock' on the ground floor seemed to do all of the room service. A man came up with a menu, we ordered by phone and the food was there in 20 minutes - perfect! We ate every breakfast from there too.
The concierge lady who books all the events/tickets/shows was lovely and really helpful.
We were on the 26th floor and it was great.
The hotel is in a perfect location for tourists, as most things you want to see are in walking distance, but we got a cab to Central Park.
The only downside was that you have to show your room pass everytime you go back into the hotel which was a bit off putting at first, but at least it shows they are security conscious.

It's also just a 5-10 minute walk from main bus terminal, so ideal for travelling cheaply to and from the airport (we flew in and out of Newark, and got the shuttle bus into town). My friend and i had booked a double room for 3 nights, but on arrival, we were disappointed that the room was so small, we couldn't have both our suitcases open at once on the floor. We asked to upgrade, and were able to do so the next day, for an additional 20$ a night (would have cost much more than this additional $40 had we booked a room with 2 double beds). It was well worth the money- we got a much bigger room, with a double bed each, plenty of space, and to top it all, the view from bed was of the Empire State Building.

"“Comfortable Stay at the New Yorker” Had a one night stay at the New Yorker in July. Got a great price through Hotwire for a NY 4-star hotel and then found out the name of the hotel was the New Yorker which is a historic hotel, built in 1929 and opening in 1930. It has retained much of its original grandeur with its art deco architectural influence and design. When you walk into its large foyer, look up at the old, beautiful tin ceiling, among other things. It is a quite busy hotel also, and I noticed many foreigners using the New Yorker as their home base. Never had to wait for an elevator though, there are more elevators here than in most hotels this size which was a plus. I arrived late in the evening and I hadn't had dinner. No problem though because the Tick Tock Diner is adjacent to the hotel and accessible from the lobby, plus it runs 24 hours a day. So I was able to get a hot meal at 10:00 pm before retiring for the evening. My room with two double beds was small but not cramped. It was very clean and the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. Like I said it's a historic hotel, so I didn't expect alot, but was pleasantly surprised at its comfort level. The bathroom was clean, had a tub/shower with good water pressure, everything operating correctly there, but was extremely small although adequate. The room even had a closet, the old fashioned kind with a heavy wood door. No view to speak of. The best part besides the comfort of the beds was being able to digitally control the air conditioning, which was a central system, not single unit.
Although there were no extras, no mini bar, coffee pot, or room service, I wasn't looking for those things. Alot of restaurants will deliver there however.

"“New Yorker in July” I booked this hotel through my local travel agent as the final stop on a three week visit to the New England area. It was recommended by a friend. We had two adjoining rooms. My three adult children had a bright airy room with two queen beds and a spacious bathroom. Our room next door was not as big, with a lovely view of a brick wall. However, in NYC one spends very little time in ones hotel room so that was not a problem. The hotel is nice, if a little dated, as I suppose can be expected in an Art Deco building. The reception staff were very good and a fine breakfast is available (extra) in the adjoining Tick Tock diner. The hotel is only a short stroll from Macy's , the Empire State Building and Times Square and is across the road from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Two rooms for four nights for five people cost me €2400, which is not cheap. Also, in my travels in the weeks previously I had become used to tea/coffee making facilities in the room.

Mohammed at the front office help me out and gives us a room facing Empire State without any additional cost at all. We were so delighted with the room and extend our stay for another day.

"“Nice surprise at The New Yorker” Went as a gift from my family for my 60th birthday. When we checked in Ana noticed it mentioned my birthday on the reservation and gave my daughter and I free full breakfast every morning, beautiful chocolates and we had a nice big room with two beds and two closets. We were so surprised and Ana made our day. The hotel is in a great location with all the subway lines within a block and Times Square about 15 minutes away by foot. 
We walked from Times Square at midnight every night and felt totally safe. Macy's is right around the corner and there is lots of great shopping within a block or two of the hotel. The Empire State Building is only 3 blocks away. Overall great stay.

"“Best hotel to see 4th of July fireworks!” Okay, so check-in was a little nerve-wracking. It took us an hour to manage to pull up in front of the hotel and the line to check-in and get our room keys was very long. But other than that, our stay was wonderful!
My husband just happened to find out that this hotel offers an all-you-can-eat buffet and a perfect view of the 4th of July fireworks for a very reasonable price! We didn't have to fight the crowds at all! 
After the buffet, we watched the fireworks from the 38th floor balcony overlooking the Hudson Bay while enjoying a desert buffet and unlimited drinks. The best part...they didn't pack us in like sardines! They only sold it to the first 40 or 50 people lucky enough to find the offer! 
The location is absolutely perfect! It is literally blocks from everything! Yes, the hotel is older, but that is what makes it so charming. It has recently been renovated too. 
We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building from our room, the price was so much cheaper than surrounding hotels and the room was quite large for a Manhattan hotel. Only downside...no pool.

"“Great Value - Very Pleased - An Economical Perspective” We stayed at the New Yorker for 5 nights. Location is phenomenal. Very clean. All staff was very polite. Small, but very functional room. Bathroom was very clean but because it is an older style hotel, it didn't have the space and functionality of your typical chain hotels. For the record, we paid 1050.00 US (incl. all fees and taxes) for the 5 nights and it included a great breakfast with a fantastic view on the 39th floor. Got the promo deal off travelzoo. My suggestion is if you decide on this hotel, check several websites often including calling the hotel directly. Reserve the room but always make sure you have a no-fee cancellation policy. Continue to research a better quote and if you find it, cancel the existing one. If money is not an issue, stay at the Trump Towers. Access to Penn Station was a pleasant advantage. We took the New Jersey Transit Train in to Penn and realized we were a 4 min. walk from the hotel. NJ Transit from Newark International was very inexpensive and convenient. 12.50 per person and about a 35 min ride in. Managing your luggage on this commuter type train can be a minor issue depending on the time you use it. I suggest boarding on the front trains or back trains where they are more likely to be less packed than the middle cars. 
The 75 minute sightseeing cruise was excellent. I believe the 2 or 3 hour tours would be too long. It was about 22.00 and very worthwhile. The Intrepid was excellent, the NBC Tour was mildly entertaining..not the way we wanted to spend 1.5 hours. (take it or leave it) Renting bikes for seeing Central Park was a great idea. Very pleasant and relaxing. If you rent at Central Park, the prices are fixed. Otherwise, if you go with the ""off-site"" companies, you can always ask for a better price or an extension on the time. They'll find you before you find them. The Comedy Cellar in Greenwich Village was great. Tons of neat restaurants in Hell's Kitchen along 9th avenue. If it fits your itinerary, take advantage of the Happy Hour prices for meals and drinks. (ie 3.00 - 4.00 for a glass of beer or wine) Little Italy was great - take your time and don't be embarrassed to read the menus that are displayed outside and then make a final decision after viewing a few of them - it's part of the experience. Stomp (off Broadway) was excellent/unique/entertaining. Highly recommended. We went directly to the theatre to buy tickets the day before...they matched the price that we saw online without hesitation. (again...it was a travelzoo price) Be sure to pre-book your visit to Ground Zero. DO NOT SHOW UP WITHOUT RESERVED BOOKINGS...YOU'LL BE IN LINE FOREVER. AND YOU STILL MAY NOT GET IN. Booking online is very simple and if you don't have access to a printer, you can print off your bookings at the central booking office. Walking is an excellent way to see the city...a suggestion would be to walk to a farther destination and after a long day of walking, take the subway back. We walked from the New Yorker to Battery Park with all sorts of stops etc and then took the subway back in the early evening. (2.50 a ride) The central location of the New Yorker allowed us to get back to our hotel to freshen up and continue our tourist stuff in the evening.",enangit,2012-07-01,122005,2012-07-24,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Worst hotel experience I ever had” I am currently staying at this hotel, and i would like to share with you the humiliating experience i had in checking in. I approached the receptionist, she did not greet me or smile. I started looking for my travel documents and she asked me weather i was a student (quite a weird question since I'm a 30 years old business women). It turns out Expedia misspelled my name, so she could not find it. she asked me when did I make the reservation, and I handed her a printed confirmation. For a few minutes she looked for it, not telling me what's going on just mumbling ""no, no reservation"". At that point i asked to speak to a manager. The manger seemed angry for calling her. she said I was already being taken care off, and I should sit and wait. Finally my reservation was found, again no smile, a kind word or any apology. manger and receptionist were rude and unwelcoming. I felt very offended by them and actually started tearing up in the elevator. Room is tiny, dark and old. bellow average for NYC standard. My family stayed here last month in a much nicer room. I went down again for a different person and asked to get another room.

"“Great Location” Our first trip to New York, and the New Yorker was ideal for us. You are close enough to walk to Times Square and many other attractions, but there is an underground entrance right next to the entrance to the diner so exploring the city was very easy (and with a seven day unlimited ride ticket for the subway and buses, it was great value too - and this also allows you to travel on the buses and rail line on Staten Island) The room was small, but you could enjoy the sunset over the Hudson River between the few blocks between the hotel and the river. The security in the hotel was good and the Diner was so good we ate there for quite a few meals during our ten day stay. It was always busy, but the food was fresh, tasty and good value.

"“TERRIBLE VALET! DISHONEST, RUDE, UNSKILLED!” I recently stayed at this hotel with my family because a family member had a business convention within this hotel. We live about 400-500 miles away, and we drove, since it is cheaper than by plane. We arrived at the hotel, got obnoxiously yelled at by the valet man outside for being slightly within the bike lane, and gave our car to him to park. Three days later, we check out. It took 20 minutes just to get our car, and this unusually nice guy (stingy-looking) steps out of the car, assertively puts our bags in the trunk, and stands awkwardly close to the rear end of the car until we get in it. We pay our $105 valet bill ($35 per night/ $45 for minivans (STUPID)), and leave, only to find a dent in our RENTAL car while filling up for gas in Pennsylvania. The bumper was slightly separated from the main body of the car, and there are scratches within the dent. The hotel itself was average, with rude front desk staff yet an excellent location. When we first called the valet service, a man picked up and we complained. He stated something about the business manager coming all the way to Kentucky(where we live) to ""observe the damages""(ridiculously made up on the spot!), and hung up rudely after we asked for his name. We hate businesses where the employees hide their mistakes from you, like what this guy who returned our car did! It's sly and dishonest! This one incident made our entire stay in New York unenjoyable! We are discouraged from ever staying at this hotel again. We've never had any problems with valet services, and it's extremely disappointing that the New Yorker is the first. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE WITH YOUR CAR. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE VEHICLE THAT YOU TRUST THEM WITH.",cfraiser,2012-07-01,122005,2012-07-22,True,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The service is not great (especially reception) and they are understaffed for the amount of guests they have (which is a TON because the hotel is gigantic). The place is kind of like a zoo and just to have them hold our luggage before check-in we had to wait in a 30 minute line. The bathroom was not 100% clean upon arrival. Small and outdated rooms.

"“Great location, OK accommodations” My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night so we could spend two days in the city. We chose The New Yorker because of its proximity to Penn Station--its extremely close! It was great not to have to walk far or take a cab after our 3 1/2 hour train ride. We arrived mid-morning and check-in is at 3:00, but they let us leave our bags with the bellhop, no problem. We had also booked a ""view"" room and we were able to request a room on the Empire State Building side, which took us to the 32nd floor with an incredible view of the skyline. I'd say that was worth it if you've never been to the city before.
The room was small, as was the bathroom, but we weren't there to hang out in the room. Basically it's just a place to sleep and keep your stuff, but the beds and pillows were quite comfortable. 
The service was very good. We ate dinner at Cooper's Tavern, which was nice. They say business casual attire, but several people were wearing jeans and t-shirts. My husband's filet was cooked perfectly and the prices weren't astronomical (but certainly not cheap). We also had breakfast at the Tick Tock Diner which, despite being extremely busy and tightly packed, had very fast service. The food was average.
We were also relieved to learn that the hotel would hold our bags even after checkout. We'd been concerned that we'd have to lug them around all day. Checkout is at noon and our train wasn't until 7:00 and there are no lockers at Penn Station. The hotel held our bags for a minimal 2:00 charge.
Overall, we were pleased with the service and the location couldn't be beat. The rooms were just okay, but comfortable and all we really needed.

"“Not bad!” Stayed here the first week in July with my friend. We booked the room through another booking website back in January. On arrival, the porter came and took our bags from the taxi and brought them to reception with us for check in. Reception dealt with our check in quickly enough but weren't exactly over friendly either. Our room was as you'd expect in New York, small and just enough room to walk around the bed. However, it was still slightly more spacious than another hotel room I've previously stayed in and the room was clean and tidy. The only problem I'd have with the room in general was the shower. For a hotel that's supposed to have been ""renovated and updated"", they seem to have forgotten the shower! We spent more time trying to adjust the water temperature than we actually spent in the shower itself! This I really feel needs to be looked at. The bathroom itself was clean enough. The location of the hotel I found was excellent; only a few blocks from Times Square and even closer to the Empire State Building. There was also plenty of shopping nearby. There's a 24 hour Tick Tock Diner in the hotel block which we went to for food on our first evening there and for breakfast another morning. The food is average, the service was good, but I wouldn't have rushed back. There was also a slightly classier restaurant called Coopers at the other side of the reception/lobby area. We ate in here on the 4th July before going to the Fireworks. The food was ok, I wasn't as impressed as I felt I could have been for the price, but our time there was enjoyable all the same.

It was the perfect location.,gem1984_10_11,2012-07-01,122005,2012-07-18,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent location” Excellent location, well maintained hotel but impersonal, feels safe and secure, rooms ridiculously teeny tiny no space to store our clothes or our baggage but very clean and tidy, staff are abrupt and to the point but do help. We were on the 20th floor, below that even smaller rooms. Price is extremely expensive for what you get. You pay for the location and a bed, that's it!

"“Great views... if you can stand the wait.” My mother and I booked one of the Tower Suites at the New Yorker for our trip into NYC this week. We arrived at the hotel too early to check in but were allowed to have our car valet parked at a rate of $35 for 25 hours--comparable to what you'll find at other parking garages around the city. After catching a cab and doing a few touristy things, we returned around 3:00 p.m. to check in, as advised. We had to wait in a pretty long line to check in, and when we finally were able to check in, we found out that our room had been given to another party and that we'd been given a free upgrade, if we would just wait a few minutes.
A few minutes turned into about twenty minutes, which were spent in the busy (though beautiful) lobby. We were finally able to head to our room on the 40th floor around 3:45, and it was absolutely gorgeous. The decor and panoramic views of Manhattan were well worth the price we paid. The only trouble was that in the rush to get us our free upgrade, the housekeeping staff had neglected to give us a shower curtain and restock our fridge and toiletries. Fortunately, that problem was cleared up relatively quickly.
As part of our free upgrade, we were given complimentary continental breakfast in the Sky Lounge on the 39th floor. The Sky Lounge had a rather intimidating ""bouncer,"" who let us in after we gave him our room number. Once again, the views were incredible, showing off Manhattan and a view of the new WTC towers and Hudson River, but breakfast itself was kind of sad: some granola and boxed cereals, a few stale pastries and cheese cubes, and carafes of juice--more the kind of fare I'd expect to see at a Holiday Inn's continental breakfast rather than at the Hotel New Yorker. Additionally, the Sky Lounge was pretty small, only fitting about 15-20 people at a time.
The location of the Hotel New Yorker can really only be beaten by hotels in Times Square--it's right on the corner of 8th and 34th, and easily walking distance to almost all of the major attractions (though if you've got bad ankles like me, you'll probably want to take a cab to places like Central Park). It's also literally across the street from Macy's, so if you want to get some shopping done, this is the place to do it.
I would advise against using the New Yorker's valet parking service, though. After we'd checked out in the morning, we gave the doorman our valet ticket and were told our car would be brought to us in about 20 minutes. This already seemed like a long wait to get our car, but those 20 minutes passed, then 45 minutes, then an hour. At an hour and a half and frustrated out of our senses, we had a stern talk with the doorman. He asked which car was ours, sent the valet to get it, and he returned not five minutes later. The doorman claimed they had a computer malfunction, but considering the way things turned out, I'm skeptical.",AbbyD522,2012-07-01,122005,2012-07-17,False,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Better than expected, will revisit” New York hotels are notorious for shabbyness, bed-bugs, unfriendly staff, rip-off pricing - you name it. I had read a lot of TripAdvisor reviews about the hotel and expected it to be a pretty safe bet. We were staying 5 nights and with family of 4 wanting to share a room or connected rooms, went for a junior suite. Knew upon reservation that it would be on the 40th floor with a guaranteed view towards the Empire State Building. The view alone was spectacular. The suite was just as expected, double queen beds in a separate room (with flat TV) and large closet fitting in an open suitcase and still room for other bags) and a small living room with own TV, sink, coffee maker, small desk and fridge (roomy for own beverages plus complimentary softdrinks and water). Location is really ideal. Penn Station serves uptown-downtown subways, Port Authority bus station just a few blocks up (bus to Jersey Gardens Outlet Mall!) and all mid-town attractions a walk away. Complimentary breakfast (nothing fancy, but juices, coffee&tea, cereals, bagels, yoghurts etc. on 39th floor lounge (one floor below us). There are a lot of elevators, which is good since this is a huge hotel and for us there was 6 elevators serving only floors 20-40, never a long wait. The bathroom was a little snug and not in perfect condition, but just good enough. Service was occasionally really friendly, at times a little dull, luggage storage was a rip-off (2$ per piece), cleaning ladies were very friendly and flexible on cleaning times. Not sure of the official rating, but I'd say NYH is 3,5 stars. Reportedly the hotel has undergone a lot of renovation, but this was not visible on our floor at least. The kids loved it anyway and of the 7-8 hotels we stayed at during 2,5 weeks in the States, NYH ranked #1, and kids are pretty demanding guests :-)",Egotrippi,2012-07-01,122005,2012-07-17,False,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location & view, small room” The New Yorker was our base for almost a week in NYC, and it did the job well. Not exactly cheap, but I guess the price is fair considered the great location; very much in the center of Manhattan with Times Square nearby and a Metro almost at the front for easy access to the entire city. 
The room was clean, but quite small. That was OK, though, since we used it almost exclusively at night. We had unimpeded view of the Empire State Building.",Michael S,2012-06-01,122005,2012-07-12,False,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Historic and great staff!” I really enjoyed my stay at the New Yorker. The hotel is a landmark of New York so it is a cool place to stay for the nostalgia. In addition to the retro ambiance, the staff was very pleasant and helpful. The rooms have a cool look and feel for an older hotel and they keep things nice. I'm big on comfort and the sheets and bed were very comfortable. The gym was surprisingly decent too. As a regular business traveler it is nice to have a more sizable gym for use. Not to mention it's in a very central location!

"“Great staff and great location!” When we arrived we told the man at the desk (Muhammad) we were there to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and he immediately shook our hands, gave us chocolates and set about upgrading our room. He gave us a room where we could see the 4th July fireworks and had a good view of the Hudson river. I don't have any other rooms to compare it with but the beds were comfy, and the room quite large. Although it is all refurbished, the bathroom doesn't feel modern, but it is clean and functional, so not a problem. All the staff were very helpful and friendly, although check-in queues seem to take a while to diminish. The Tick Tock dinner which is attached to the hotel is great and always busy, which is testament to its quality (and 24 hours a day availability!). The staff will bring you extras if you ask - we asked for tea and coffee facilities and they brought a coffee machine, so if you like tea, bring your own proper tea bags! We found the location was just right - with the subway being so near and you can reach everywhere easily. Do visit the ""highline"" which is a restful park/walk only recently opened and not always mentioned on the leaflets. In the hotel avoid the concierge who tried to sell us tickets for Lion King for $600 for 2 tickets. We went to Times Square and got half price Chicago tickets for $150 for 2. In summary, Muhammad at the desk - very helpful, concierge man - it felt like we were disturbing him!

"“Complete disappointment, but what do they care” I booked this hotel in March for a July stay for our wedding anniversary. We arrived too early to check in so headed out for some shopping and eats. Upon returning after 3 pm there was a line snaking through the lobby for the check in desk and we waited over an hour only to hear that we had to step aside and wait for the manager. Another 30 minutes later, the manager appears from behind the door to tell us that our room (a Tower suite with balcony) was not ready. No explanation, no offer to relax with a complimentary drink at the bar, no apology. An hour later, I ask again, same answer. An hour later, my husband asks again, same answer. By now I am on the phone cancelling and rearranging our reservations for that night. At 6 pm I can't believe that we are being ignored like this and why the heck isn't the ""manager"" making any effort to check on our room himself to offer an explanation about what is going on?! I'm seriously believing that they sold our room out from under us and were purposely dissing us to make us go away. Well it worked. I asked for a cancellation number and made the gutsy move to find another hotel at the last minute for our three night stay. Sometime you just gotta let your feet do the talking. Now I'm watching my credit card statement and they BETTER NOT charge me!! This place is like a cattle car.

"“Nice hotel, convenient to Broadway, decent value” The New Yorker Hotel is conveniently located to Broadway, the Garment District, and Korea Town. The hotel is constructed in the lovely old Art Deco style with high ceilings, marble floors, and wonderful lighting fixtures and wall textures. The rooms have been renovated for carpeting, furniture, bedding, heating/air conditioning and lighting. The bed was PRISTINE and comfortable. The bathrooms are a bit old and small, but perfectly functional. Free wifi, iron, ironing board, hair dryer, and flat screen TV. No refrigerator.
The hallways are musty and really should be updated in keeping with the rest of the quality of the hotel.
The staff was rather indifferent: I waited a long time for the valet to come get my car in front of 8th Ave--there was no one in site. I called the hotel three times to inquire about valet, but I kept getting voicemail. Finally, someone came to get my car. There is no doorman, or greeter. Bare-bones staff. The reception gal was not very cheery or welcoming, but WAS helpful in getting me my room.
There are two wonderful restaurants on the premises: Cooper's Tavern (lunch and dinner) and Tick Tock (breakfast and lunch 24 hours). I recommend both.
All in all, it was a decent hotel at a good value. Nothing remarkable.",motherbored,2012-07-01,122005,2012-07-11,False,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“June '12” Thoroughly enjoyed our 6 night stay in early June; we had a room with 2 beds which though not spacious was roomy enough not to feel cramped, housekeeping staff ensured that the room was thoroughly cleaned every day. Despite some poor reviews I have read regarding the staff at the check in desk, we never found them anything but pleasant and helpful. I emailed ahead of our visit and requested a complimentary coffee machine - which was in our room soon after arrival, and my friend who was celebrating her birthday received some chocolates when we checked in. We had a corner room on a high floor with a fantastic view of The Empire State and Chrysler Buildings from one window and Maddison Square Garden and the Financial district from the other - spectacular!
The hotel is ideally located for walking to many attractions and next to the subway and Penn Station for others.
There are numerous places to eat within a block - Tick Tock Diner and Stage Door I would recommend for breakfast and we ate a good evening meal at Cooper's Tavern.

it is quite so you can rest, very comfortable bed. Not very big room but more than enough for everything. No luxury but comfortable, clean, great views.

“Good hotel” Spent 6 nights at this hotel last week. Very good. Staff were very friendly. We had a room overlooking the Empire State Building on the 31st floor which was very good. It was one of the refurbished rooms which you had to pay extra for. The only down side we found was that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room or any room service. The first room we had was quite small but refurbished and a view of other windows. We moved due to noisy neighbours. But this was not a problem we were moved very quickly. Our second room on the 31st floor was bigger.

“Great location! Huge room!” We booked this hotel off of hotwire for a last minute trip to NYC. It was the largest hotel room (with the exception of a suite at the Waldorf Towers) that I have every stayed at in NYC. Clean room. Plenty of closet and storage space. Train station pretty much right outside the doors. On-site 24 hour diner that is reasonably priced with friendly servers.

"“Perfect for Families!” First trip to NYC and were worried since we needed a good sized room for a good price. My husband and I were completely thrilled when we walked through the doors of our room! The suite was definately worth the few extra $$ we spent! We had a separate room with a sofa bed and 3 chairs and a flat screen. The bedroom had 2 double bed that were comfortable and had plenty of pillows and nice bedding. The bathroom was a typical older one. I actually loved it- took me back to my childhood with the pedastal sink and tile bath. Great water pressure( might sound silly but when an entire family needs to shower every morning you learn to appreciate small things!). We requested a room that would allow us to see the fireworks on the Hudson from our room... We had NO IDEA we would have a balcony! And, from our 26th floor, we had the best view of the show than anyone! We ordered pizza and sat out on the balcony and listened to the broadcast from our Ipad! No crowds and Great pics! 
The location is perfect! Across from the train station, subway literally out the front door. We walked to Times Square often, maybe 10 minutes. You can grab a cab with the help of the doorman and it is really inexpensive and hassle free! 
There are endless choices for food in this area, but the best ( especially according to my 3 boys) was in the hotel. The Tick Tock Diner is hard to beat, for breakfast, lunch or dinner! We ate there at least once every day we were there! 
I am an extremely honest, no nonsense traveller. I am not extremely hard to please about most things, but I won't tolerate dirty rooms, rude staff and noise... This Iconic hotel is a GEM in the midst of some pretty yucky places! I will most definately be back and will certainly suggest The New Yorker to anyone who will listen!

"“Not worth the money!!!!!!” Was in New York City for Dance Educators of America workshops and competition for my daughter. This was exciting for her, but hell for me. I did not book with the rooms blocked by DEA so I didnot receive a discount on my room. The room was very small, felt like I was in a closet. After speaking with several people they stated that this was the norm for NYC. Pushing past the smallness of the room I was still quite shocked as there were no amenities (i.e. microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker). I travel extensively throughtout the United States and abroad and for the money that I spent for these accomodations I definitely was expecting more. They rate this hotel as 4 stars, I beg to differ. The walls are paper thin, seeming as though the neighbors who were constantly slamming doors and had loud conversation, were staying in the same room as me. The hotel staff was very rude. I was checked in right away because I probably had the room that no one wanted. Other people who were traveling with me for the same event did not get checked in until after 7p.m. and when they questioned the front desk staff as to when their room would be ready the staff appeared to be very irritated. Everyone states what a beautiful view they had overlooking NYC. Well I beg to differ on that comment also, my view was of other windows to other rooms. After placing a phone call to have my room changed because of the noise at 2a.m. in the morning I still had a crappy view. I don't mind paying the money if I am going to get what I pay for.

"“First Class!” We arrived at the New Yorker three hours early for check in on July 4th, hoping to at least be able to drop off our bags and even better if we could actually get into our room early. Upon arrival there was some kind of confusion over the accommodations for a tower suite I had booked on a travel site I had not used before, but had found through Kayak. 
Oneida (sp?) at the front desk said not to worry, and in fact upgraded us for free to an executive suite with a huge balcony overlooking Manhattan. My wife and two kids could not believe what an unbelievable room we had and the balcony was such a huge hit it was hard to get them out the door to go explore NYC. The suite was immaculate and the queen size sleeper sofa was excellent for the kids in the main living room.
The hotel had a classic old school Manhattan feel, but updated enough to not feel out of date. Cool to know the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe DiMaggio, JFK, etc had stayed there back in the day. Enjoyed breakfast downstairs at the Tick Tock Diner, quick service and good food.

"“Good location for sites, not nicest part though, expensive, not 4 star” We stayed at the New Yorker in Sept 2011. We chose it because looking at the map it was central. It is central, but having said that, it looked to us like a rather run-down part of New York. The streets were strewn with litter and there was a constant pong from the drains running beneath the pavements and lots of 50p shops! As for the hotel, it’s just 'OK'. Rooms are minute; the single built-in wardrobe would not have looked out of place in a dolls house and to make it even smaller, there was an ironing board in it! Not much point in ironing your clothes when there’s nowhere to hang them! We had to ask for more hangers too, only 5 provided for 2 adults for a 6 day stay! The bathroom was sparse, the odd cracked tile and don’t rely on complimentary shampoo etc, it’s all pretty low grade! Simple things would have improved the bathroom like a toilet role holder and a soap dish! The shower was powerful though and plenty of hot water and the bedroom was clean. The 1930’s theme would have been appreciated if the furniture had not been ‘Dime Store’ standard! At the concierge in the lobby there was a constant queue; the one morning we did wait to speak to the lady, she couldn’t offer us any advice on choosing a tour bus company other than “if you walk down the street you’ll find a rep”. The adjoining Tick Tock diner is only acceptable if you can’t find anywhere open nearby when you arrive; it’s expensive, the place isn't too clean, and the toilets are really bad. For a good breakfast, as you exit the hotel, turn left and there’s a great self-service place a few yards down. Not as much selection on a Sunday (when there aren’t any office workers) but great in the week and the cheese pastries are to die for! 
Overall the hotel is architecturally stunning, in a good location transport-wise and for site seeing, but rooms are certainly not 4 star standard and as such the hotel is overpriced. If I went back to New York, I’d stay out of the thick of it, in Greenwich Village and travel to the sites from there, as public transport is so good. That way you are staying in a much nicer environment.",snowbikesrule,2011-09-01,122005,2012-07-08,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

They have rooms qith a really nice view, wich was not my case...
I had a closed view in my room.
Maybe if it is requested on the reservation, you can get it!
The room is not so big as the photos, and has no refrigerator.
The bed and pillows were very good, but the shower was dificult to get the right temperature. Sometimes too hot, sometimes cold.
The location is the best part.
All the subways very near, Macys, and a lot of other stores on 34th, 
It is near from Times Square also, about 10 blocks, but is fun to walk around!

“Location Location Location” Right in the heart of downtown. We walked everywhere! Friendly staff. Feels secure because there's always an attendant at the elevators checking to make sure you're a guest with a key. Clean rooms. Yes they are small but if you're staying in Manhattan why on earth are you spending so much time in your room!? We even had a room with a view of the Hudson River.

"“Brilliant Hotel, completes a trip to NY!” We stayed at the New Yorker hotel in June 2011 for 4 nights. Upon arrival at the hotel we ate at the 24 hours diner on the ground floor, which does excellent food, including pancakes, waffles and all your other traditional american treats. There was a great selection of food at a decent price. Following this, we checked in. After booking a standard twin room, we asked at the desk if we could have a room with a view (of the Empire State building) and were granted just that!!! I presume this is usually a chargeable extra, as the view is brilliant if you are on one of the higher floors of the hotel.
The room itself was plenty big enough considering we didn't spend much time at the hotel, and we both had the comfiest double beds. The bathroom was nice and modern, as was the decor in the hotel, which had an art/deco feel, with great big chandeliers in the foyer. 
The staff at the hotel were fantastic, very knowledgeable about sight seeing and transport and there was a man outside hailing cabs for you. We did struggle one evening when going to the theater so leave plenty of time as it took us around 25 minutes to get a cab. 
Location is vital in New York, luckily this hotel is situated about 3 minutes from macy's and less than 10 minutes from Times Square and the Empire State building. There is also Penn Station and numerous subway stops nearby too. The location of this hotel made it very easy to get around Manhattan.
As a first timer in NYC, I can honestly say this hotel was a joy to stay at, comfortable, very clean and great staff made it a great experience, one I hope to repeat in a couple of years. I will definitely recommend the New Yorker to my friends and family for years to come.",TravelGirl2112,2012-06-01,122005,2012-07-05,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Train Traveler Best Location” If your traveling by train into NYC a good choice is the New Yorker. Located a short block away from the exit from Penn Station the New Yorker is a good, reasonably priced hotel. The hotel is a good 3-star hotel located in Mid-town Manhatten. For the price of a double hotel Room in the city we booked a Junior Suite. The hotel is clean, and the staff very helpful and friendly.
A couple of good points; First, the Tic Toc Deli is a great within the hotel is very good and available 24 hours a day, Second, the security is well managed. A couple of negatives; First, when you're paying over $300.00/per day for a room, I expect more than plastic cups for drinking glasses, and Second, unlike most New York hotels, the concierge was less than helpful, and actually a bit of a disappointment.
A hint is to visit BH Photo located less than a block away from the New yorker hotel on 9th Ave. between 33rd and 34th streets. BH Photo has everything you could possibly want for photo and computer needs.

"“nice hotel central location” I have just returned from a 5 night stay at the New yorker with my teenage daughter. The hotel is in a good location for sightseeing and very central - however the area is a little bit rough at night. Despite it being only 5 minutes walk from 5th Ave and about 10 from Times Square I did feel a bit vulnerable walking back to the hotel at night. After the first night we therefore got a cab which solved the problem. The hotel is good value for money - the rooms are very small and we had no view whatsoever - and could not really even tell what the weather was like outside as we were just facing other parts of the hotel - so if the view and the size of the room are important then I would suggest an upgrade. However, to us this was not important at all as we were hardly in the room other than to sleep - on the plus side the beds are really comfortable and the rooms were cleaned every day.Therefore if like us you are just booking this hotel as a base I think it is perfect. The tick tock diner is great - really good choice of food, good service and good quality. Any staff we came into contact with were friendly and helpful. New york was, as always amazing, and I would stay at this hotel again but would just make sure I got a cab late at night.",shelll1971,2012-06-01,122005,2012-07-05,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“The room that time forgot” Just got home from a 3 night stay at The New Yorker Hotel. Overall, the hotel was ok. The location is excellent and the people were personable. I also enjoyed the food at the Tick Tock Diner. As for my room, room 2649 - on the plus side, and most importantly, it appeared clean. The downside is that it was hideously ugly! A brown and tan jungle motif may have been considered chic 50 years ago (though I can't imagine anybody ever liking this particular decor); today, it's just dated. Spend the money, and update the room. While people don't visit New York in order to stay in their rooms, never underestimate how much a beautiful room can enhance ones vacation experience - it's why people are willing to pay extra for a room with a fantastic view.
I booked this hotel on the hotel website, and specfically requested a fridge in which to store my medication. There was no fridge in the room. In fact, the room was so small that there wouldn't have been any room for one - I would have had to be relocated to another room. It wasn't a life or death situation, and I managed; it would have been a point in their favor however, had they accomodated my request.
Another problem that I had was that I was on a non-smoking floor, but could still smell cigarette smoke. Hotels in general - not just this one - need to to do a better job managing this problem. Smoke travels; so it doesn't do much good to have alternate smoking/non-smoking rooms, or floors since the smoke is going to travel to the non-smoking areas. Once I got home, I went back to their wesite to review the amenities that they offer, and was surprised to see that they advertise the hotel as a smoke-free hotel. In that case, what's the policy if a guest reports smelling cigarette smoke? To be clear, I did not report it because I thought the smoke was coming from another floor where smoking was allowed. Had I known that the entire hotel was supposed to be smoke-free, I would have contacted the front desk.

"“NYC again this was the best yet...... :-)” We arrived at the New Yorker at 2:30pm and check in was very efficient... The staff were extremely helpful and knowledgable. Having read a few reviews I was a little concerned but I had no reson to be. The rooms were very clean and of a great standard...they weren't huge but they were plenty big enough for myself and friend. We had a double bed each and the beds were so comfortable to get into after busy days and nights out seeing the sights and shopping...the tik tok diner was downstairs in through a door in the lobby which made it real easy to go get breakfast and then nip back to our room to get what we needed for the day. It was in a great location for walking to times square etc. and the empire state build was just a little further along the road. It was a sight we were greated with when we walked out in the morning, the hotel is diagonally across from Maddison Square Gardens, and also penn st station. 
I would definately recommend this hot to anyone travelling to New York whether it be your first time or a repeat visit there. I have stayed in a few hotels in NYC and this so far is my favourite. 
I would stay in this hotel again, but before I return to this one there are a few more I want to try there first.

The bathrooms were out of date but how long are you really in your room in the city anyway? We were on the 19th floor and it felt like we were on the first with all of the sounds during the night like the sirens and garbage trucks but that's to be expected anywhere in the city. The location was amazing, right across the street from one of the subway lines and a block away from the other. We also road the Grayline tour bus for 2 days and it picked us up a block down, AMAZING. Right across the street was Starbucks, McDonalds and a great pizza place. I wouldn't reccommed the TGI Fridays across the street, wwwwaaaaayyy overpriced. The Tick Toc Diner connected to the hotel was very convinent. We would go eat breakfast there every morning and it was very fast service, the strawberry crepes were fantastic. Overall it was the perfect hotel for us.

Housekeepers are too thorough with their cleanliness that they ""äccidentally"" threw away my husbands NEW ADIDAS shoes that was inside a shopping bag.We found out that his shoes was gone on the day of our departure while packing.The housekeeper assumed that the shopping bags near the garbage cans were trash and she just took all of those shopping bags away.Investigation is still going on but when housekeeping was asked about this,they denied going inside the room.Very Frustrated!!!

"“Nice Stay, Nice Surprise” The front desk staff was very nice and helpful; they let us check in early although check in time was 3:00 we got our room key at 12:00 noon. The gentleman at the Help desk was not so friendly and they checked your room key every time before they would allow you to board an elevator. The first impression of the hotel is big and nice, but old. The carpet throughout the Hotel needs to be updated. I asked for a room on a higher floor with a city view. We were granted a room on the 33 floor which was very nice. Our view was from the back of the hotel and overlooked the River. This was not a City View, but we were happy. The room itself was big enough for 3 people to move around with comfort. The bathroom was small, but met our needs. The Beds were very comfortable and two pillows for each person. Our room had two double beds, a desk with chair, and a bedside table between the two beds. We had a new Flat screen large TV, which was on a dresser with three drawers. There was also a Closet space for storage of luggage and totes, also a place to hang clothes. The room also came with a full size Ironing board and full size Iron. Fresh towels and toiletries were put in all three days of our stay. Our Blow Dryer in the bathroom did not work and sparks flew when it was turned on. I reported this to the help desk and they sent someone up right away while we were out. Upon our return, we noticed the Blow Dryer was taken off the wall mount and there was not one in replace. I then noticed I had a voicemail on the phone and got a message from the housekeeping staff saying the Blow-dryer was broken and they did not have one to replace at this time. This left two women without a blow-dryer and we did not pack one because we knew there was one in the Hotel Room. 
Over all, we had a pleasant stay at the New Yorker Hotel. We ate 2 times at the Tick Tock diner. The food was average and nothing to brag about. There was also a McDonalds Fast Food across the street from the Hotel. They also have a business center where you can use one of four Computers and are able to print, but beware it is not free. They require you to scan your credit card before it will allow you to get on the computer. If you print it will charge your card $.25 per copy. Over all this is a good hotel to stay in the city.

"“Would never stay there again...” The location is great but that's about it. The rooms are small and although they recently put in new furniture the bathroom has been untouched. We only had 2 towels and my husband had to go out and ask for extra towels and was asked 4-5 questions by the hotel staff before getting the towels. There was no place to hang our towels so they stayed wet throughout our visit.
I was ""ok"" with the hotel until our last day when the fire alarm went off at 5am. We called the front desk and they told us they were checking with security and would call us back, that's reassuring. Without waiting for our phone call we left our hotel room and there was smoke in the hall and we couldn't use the closest stairs due to even more smoke when we opened the door. It was the scariest thing I've ever encountered in my life. We walked down 21 flights and was out on the New York street for over an hour. 
Without any information as to what had happened we were told to go back to our room. About 10 minutes later the alarm went off again and we walked down again. When we (and others) arrived at the front desk they told us that they were ""resetting the alarm"" and that they had made an anouncement. Well we waited a good 60 seconds in our room and no announcement was made which is why we walked down again. Then the front desk clerk tried to blame us and said that we ""we're just on edge"" and that's why we didn't hear the anouncement. He was blaming us?

The other restaurant at the right side of the building was not good value for money and tastes were not something special. However there is plenty of food options in the area. I didnt like that there are no safes in the rooms and when I was out my ipad and laptop could not be stored. For safely storing my money when I was out of the hotel I had to go downstairs to the safes located by the reception area, not very handy but at least there is an option for money and small valubles but not enough space for ipad and laptop.

"“Perfect!” I really enjoyed this hotel. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I ended up being very happy!
Let me start by saying it is in the most ideal location - right across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. It is super close to ""the"" Macy's, and about 2 blocks from a bus stop for the hop on, hop off bus. It's a short walk to Times Square/Theatre district (10 minutes max) and a $5 taxi ride to Hell's Kitchen. You cannot beat the centrality. 
The staff was so pleasant and friendly. I must have encountered at least 50 employees during my stay and not one was rude. In fact, nearly all of them addressed me with ""Good morning"" or some other greeting with a big smile. I was impressed with that, and honestly surprised. I've stayed in many, many hotels and most employees don't even make eye contact. An especially wonderful moment came when we arrived at 6am. We checked our bags and the manager told us our room would be ready for a 9am check in. What??? That has never happened to me. We walked the city for a while, and were seriously ready to crash at 9 for a few hours. The red eye is brutal, and he saved us from sheer exhaustion by letting us check in early. Thank you!
The room itself was very small, but absolutely fine in every way. We weren't in a ""view"" room (Empire State Bldg or Hudson River view), but we had a view of the city and I really liked it! The bathroom had a large window that opened (not too much - it was safe) and it was so nice during showers to open it and listen to the city. Perfect. I read that some showers had uneven temperatures, and I did notice that a little, but nothing that was uncomfortable or extreme. The water pressure was awesome, better than my shower at home. I also really liked the bed - such comfortable sheets and a pillow top mattress. I slept so well!
One last thing - the elevators come fast with very little wait time, going up or down. I never knew how much that mattered until I stayed at the Doubletree in Times Square last year. The wait for an elevator was TERRIBLE. I mean we would stand there and stand there. Plus, you had to take two different elevators - one to enter the lobby, then another to get to the rooms. Boo! At the New Yorker, we NEVER had to wait - early in the morning, afternoon, or even prime going out hours. Loved that.
This was a great experience and I cannot believe how much money I saved staying here! Totally totally worth it and I will be back.

Rooms tiny with hard beds, outdated furniture, tiny TVs.

Run down hallways and slow elevators (can take you up to 10 minutes to get down to the lobby in the mornings).
Spotty Internet. 
But the unprofessional behavior of the front desk staff really is the real reason to stay away from this place. 
Location can be a plus if you need to be around the midtown area, but note that it can get loud if you are staying in a room on a lower floor facing 8th Avenue. The soundproofing on the windows isn't the greatest.

"“Great Place to Stay” We stayed five nights at The New Yorker last week. The entire experience from check in to check out was amazing. We arrived at the hotel in the late afternoon and had our keys within two minutes. Our luggage was delivered to our room a short time later. The room was typically New York small but was comfortable and well furnished. We were able to stay cool all week even though the temperature outside varied from 58 to 98. The bathroom was small but the shower flow was powerful and we had no trouble keeping the water temperature at the level we wanted. We both walked and took the subway to and from Times Square, depending on how tired we were. The Empire State Building and tour bus stops were convenient to the hotel, as were great places for pizza and deli food. We never felt uneasy outside on the streets around the hotel even when we walked back late at night. The housekeeping staff did a fantastic job cleaning and restocking the room each day. Security made sure no one could get on the elevators without showing their room key. When we left on Friday, we were able to do express checkout and our car (we drove to New York) was out front within 10 minutes. We made one left turn and one right turn and were in the Lincoln Tunnel headed to the New Jersey Turnpike.

"“Good location” we stayed in the new yorker hotel june 2012. when we checked in, there was no great welcome for us from the staff. our room was on the 24th floor with no view- disapointing ! interior of hotel and rooms nice and location was great! the diner located inside the hotel called the 'tick tock', even if you are starving, i'd advise you to stay away. the bathrooms in the diner were filthy and the food was awful.",denisandniamh,2012-06-01,122005,2012-06-26,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“A classic with some glitches” When you're outside the New Yorker Hotel, there's no doubt that you're looking at a piece of history. It's a gorgeous old building. Step inside and you're in a big lobby with a 24/7 ""Tick Tock Diner"" off to your left and Cooper's Tavern (a more upscale restaurant/lounge) off to your right, just near the check-in desk. The elevators are straight ahead and their gift shop is down a flight of stairs.
There's plenty of seating in the lobby, not all of it comfy, but in line with the character of the building. It could use more plants though.
At check-in (which was fast) I was told I was being given an upgrade to a larger room (who knew I'd booked a small room?). Because I have trouble walking and was using a cane, I asked if the room was near the elevator. The check-in man, who was very nice, told me the room was ""not a far walk from the elevator"", and up I went. The elevators are divided into two banks, one serving the lower floors and one serving the higher ones, so it was a relatively quick ride to the 19th floor.
After I got off the elevator, a sign pointed me to the left, and I followed the hallway as it twisted and turned until I finally found room 1982, which was one room short of as-far-away-from-the-elevator as i could get. And, really, if this was an upgrade, I hate to think what I might have had otherwise. The room was small. There's no in-room coffee-maker or refrigerator. There's a good-size TV, a comfy queen bed, and a hairdryer that's attached to the bathroom wall, as well as the usual soaps and shampoos. But that's it on the amenities. I had a window, but it was taped so I couldn't open it.
I opted to have dinner at Cooper's Tavern because I was too tired to wander. There's a bar with stools and lounge tables with wooden chairs as you walk in, but since I wanted a soft seat that meant I'd need a booth, so I was seated next to a wall that divided me from everything and everyone else in the restaurant. The lounge TVs were out of my view as well. Good thing I'd brought a book. I ordered Cobb Salad, and paid extra for what turned out to be 3 pieces of shrimp. The salad was so-so. Since I was tucked in a corner, service was also so-so. It felt like I'd been seated in the servant's quarters... nice, but no ambiance and food that wasn't up to NY standards.
i fell asleep early, which turned out to be a Good Thing, because at 5:00 a.m. the next morning, there was pounding on my door with a voice yelling ""Get out! Get out! Fire!! Get out"". I grabbed my robe, slippers, iPad, and purse and started my journey of walking down 19 flights of stairs (I'd forgotten my cane). There were many others with me in the stairway and thankfully none of them stepped on the hem of my nightgown, which was dragging behind me with every step. It took forever to get to the lobby, but I made it. Once there, the lobby was jammed with people and no where to sit, but (to my great relief) the Tick Tock Diner was open and had a booth for me to sit in from which I could see the activity in the main hotel. I had a cup of coffee and waited it out while firemen came and went. Within an hour or so, we were cleared to go back to our rooms. I never found out where the fire was or even if there WAS a fire.
On my way back to the room, I noticed other hallways jutting off the main hallway I was following. The walls are painted an antique white, with a photo here and there, and brown carpeting covering much of the marble flooring. The public areas could use decor: artwork and plants would do wonders for the ambiance. The brown carpeting was a poor choice, but I won't dwell.
To the hotel's credit, I was given the room for half price to make up for the inconvenience of the 19 flights of stairs... although I had to ask to speak to the manager to get that concession. 
In all, it was an experience, but I doubt I'll be seeking it out again. It's probably worth it to stay here at least once. Hopefully, your stay will be less of a workout than mine.",robinstamm,2012-06-01,122005,2012-06-26,False,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Nice (if you pay for the larger room/suite)” I the unique experience of viewing 2 rooms types during my stay. This was not under the most ideal circumstances, but it ended up okay in the long run. We original booked the ""New Yorker Room with a view"". The room (as most in New York are) was very small. After having gone through a ""recent remodel"", I was expecting more from this room. The quality of the renovation was pretty bad, as our bathroom had visible holes in the walls and floors and other areas where they had just painted over the poor patch jobs. The comment that my wife and I exchanged after a night in the room was that this was not a ""4 star"" hotel, as TripAdvisor had led us to believe. At best, I would say a 3 star. 
The morning of the second day of our stay, we were overcome with the smell of cigarette smoke (not hard in a small room). We determined that it was being blown INTO OUR ROOM through the vents. We instantly shut off the A/C in the room and I called the front desk. I was told that they would ""look into it"". After about 15 minutes, I turned on the A/C and the smell was gone. I assumed that the situation had been resolved. About 30 minutes later, the unmistakeable smell was back again and seemed to be worse than before. I called the front desk again and reported the situation. The person that I spoke to transferred me to her manager, which ended up in a voicemail. I left a message, explaining the situation, explaining the fact that my wife is allergic to smoke, and asked for a call back on my cell phone at their earliest convenience. On our way out of the building for the day, I stopped at the front desk in hopes of speaking to a manager in person. After providing a quick recap to the front desk associate, I was told that I was ""wrong"" and that the smell that I smelled was ""not cigarette smoke"", but was, instead, smoke from a fire that they had in one of the rooms. I explained to the woman that I knew that it was cigarette smoke and that it had started and stopped with about 45 minutes in between (something that a ""fire"" seemingly would not do). After she told me that I was mistaken one more time, I asked if I could leave my phone number for her manager and asked that she have them call me on my cell phone. After fumbling around for a minute, she produced a piece of paper and I wrote my contact information on it. At that time, a gentleman in a suite walked up (I assume from security) and the front desk attendant gave my newly written information to him. He assured me that he would ""look into it"" and ""get back to me shortly."" (This was at approximately 10:00 am.)
By 3:00 pm on the following day, I still hadn't heard from anyone regarding the situation. When we tried to get into our room, our room keys didn't work. I went back down and spoke with someone at the front desk and asked them to provide me with new keys. After receiving the new keys, I decided to try to speak to a manager again. After a short wait, a manager named Erica appeared. (For the record, Erica is the only reason that this review gets an ""Average"" rating instead of a ""Poor"" rating.) After I explained to Erica that I had called twice, left a voicemail once, spoken to the front desk once, and had never been called back, Erica went to work. The first thing she did was to apologize for the inconvenience (something that the first 4 individuals had failed to do). Based on the fact that they are in the hospitality industry, you would think that this would have been something that they teach the employees on the first day on the job. If it is, those 4 people were absent that day. Next, Erica explained that it was cigarette smoke that I was smelling and that they had caught the person responsible for it. The next thing Erica did was to offer us a different room. One of the few that they had available was a suite on one of the higher floors. This room was incredible and was worth every bit of the 4 stars that this hotel had promised.
Needless to say, had Erica not stepped in and been so accommodating, our stay would have been shorter and this review would have been even worse.

"“Great Stay” We arrived at The New Yorker and were struck by a sense of old time luxury. The foyer is a beauty to behold and the service was quick and courteous. Moving to the elevators it has the feeling that you are walking into the set of a movie. The rooms had recently been renovated. They were comfortable but as we were warned they were small.
The location of the hotel is great, in the clothing district and Macy's is just a short walk down 34th Street. 10 blocks from Time Square and walk out the front door past the great dinner attached to the hotel and you will find the entry to the subway and you can go anywhere for $2.50.",Bigmalus,2012-03-01,122005,2012-06-25,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Art deco in convenient Midtown location” Architecturally, the building is quite beautiful and has a long storied history. It does show its age, however in the small, oddly shaped rooms and lack of expected conveniences.
The reason you will want to stay here is for the location - literally sitting on top of Penn Station, right in the middle of Midtown, a block from Madison Square Garden and walking distance to Times Square. For you convention goers, this hotel is 4 blocks from the Javits center. For those of you traveling to New York for the first time, you will probably notice that Newark airport is close to Midtown and will be tempted to hop on a cab for a quick jaunt to the hotel. Think twice! It looks close on the map but the combination of the tunnel and traffic will add time to the trip and the tolls will add significantly to the cost. With this hotel so close to Penn Station, take NJ transit from the airport, which should only take about 30 minutes. It's even worse taking a cab from the city to the airport since there is a surcharge and the cabs will charge for the toll anyway since they have to pay it going back into Manhattan.
Once you arrive at the hotel, you will notice that there a million things going on - tour buses unload nearby, crowds are heading to the movie theater across the street or going to Madison Square Garden or simply wandering around aimlessly with map in hand. Inside the lobby you will note the Art Deco details from the reception to the lighting. Pay attention when you arrive at the bank of elevators - some are express to the upper floors (mostly the ones to your right) and you will miss your floor entirely if you enter the wrong one.
The room itself is small and depending on where you are facing may or may not have views of the city. The bed is comfortable enough and you get a small desk to do some work. The room seemed dated, no more so than the bathroom which reminded me of my first apartment. Oddly enough, there is no safe in the room so cling tightly to your valuables. Bring your own bunny slippers since you won't find any here. Don't expect to call for room service or pull a drink from the mini-bar since there isn't one! But never fear, you can head down to the Tick Tock diner (attached to the lobby) if you want a relatively affordable meal or the myriad restaurants in the area. Note the binder on your desk - it contains menus of several restaurants in the area that deliver. If you are truly desperate, McDonald's delivers as well (this seems unique to those in NY). Note that you are in the middle of a bustling city and combine that with the older windows don't expect the room to be your zen chamber.
The hotel does provide free Wi-Fi - a must for any business traveler. You also have the option of a paid service which provides faster speeds. Service was efficient and pleasant and they will work with you through the usual credit card, booking issue mishaps. There is a well appointment gym as well.
If you chose to stay here it will be for the convenient location and not for the small, outdated rooms. You can probably find other hotels at the same price point if you prefer more in-room amenities and willing to give up the excellent location so make sure to shop around.",no_map,2012-06-01,122005,2012-06-24,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“It was fine for one night and not a bad location” The hotel is diagonally opposite Madison Square Garden and only a block or two from Penn Station and is therefore very convenient for both. It's also not far from Broadway and Times Square. Having said that, this isn't an area I'd choose to stay in again because this far down 8th Avenue is a little on the seedy side. Although we didn't experience any problems during our one night stay, some of the characters on the streets looked a little dodgy and we felt that we had to avoid eye contact. Maybe, being Brits from a small town, it was just in our minds and there are certainly hotels located in worse part of New York.
The lobby area was pleasant and the staff were fine. The Tick Tock diner on the ground floor was excellent for burgers, etc. We didn't try it for breakfast as there was a queue at 9am and we didn't have the time to wait. The bar on the opposite side of the lobby was also very good but, as you might expect in a big city hotel, expensive.
Our room on the 28th floor was a reasonable size for a New York Hotel but a little on the small side compared to elsewhere in the US. The bed was comfortable and the room was well appointed. The bathroom was also a little on the small side but perfectly fine. Everything was clean and well decorated. I had the same problem I have had in most New York hotels - the constant drone of the aircon, even with the fan switched off, disturbed my sleep. There wasn't a lot of noise from the street as we were at the back of the hotel. 
New York hotels are eye-wateringly expensive these days and for the sort of money the New Yorker charges I'd expect a larger room and a better location in another city. We probably wouldn't return because of the aircon noise and not feeling totally comfortable walking in the area at night.",gojph,2012-06-01,122005,2012-06-23,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great hotel, Great location” We have just returned from a four night stay at The New Yorker Hotel, it was my second trip to new york, my boyfriend had already stayed at this hotel on a previous visit and had said how good his stay was. This hotel is in an excellent location in the city, very close to Madison square garden and Penn station and a few blocks from the empire state building and times square. 
The art deco style of this hotel is beautiful, we had a suite on the 39th floor which was lovely with great views of the city. The suite was excellent with a lounge area and good size bathroom. The bedroom was also a good size how ever it wish it had a bigger bed, it was ok but I think I expected a bigger bed, I believe it was just classed as a queen size and felt a bit small. Overall it was a really good clean room.
The staff at the hotel were all helpful and friendly, Nicole in guest services had been very helpful when my boyfriend had contacted her in the run up to our stay and Mohammed on the front desk was great on check in. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about saying that the staff were rude or have attitude. The guys that stood near the lifts were all pleasent, always spoke as we passed, yes they wanted to see your room key but the are there for a reason and I would certainly rather get my room key out and show it to someone than have any old randoms wondering around the hotel ans being able to get to my room.

"“Favorite place to stay in New York” I've stayed at the New Yorker the past three years while visiting for a conference and have never been disappointed! First, the location is stellar: right across from the street from Penn Station, where we exit from the train. An easy walk to Times Square, the theatre district and plenty more. And if you're feeling adventurous, there's a subway stop just around the corner from the entrance. 
Beyond its stellar location, the rooms are very modern, clean and well-appointed. The staff is kind and around if you need assistance. Despite being in the middle of the city, our rooms have always been quiet. On my most recent trip, we were even upgraded to a tower room -- which was amazing.

"“Fab Location, Great Value for Money” I got off to a great start with this hotel, we were met by very welcoming staff and were upgraded on arrival so ended up with a much bigger room than we had booked/paid for. The rooms are not huge but when you are in NY how long are you going to spend in the room!! The location of this hotel is hard to beat, we walked everywhere, so close to many of the main attractions - madison square garden, macys, time square, empire state, broadway..............
Also on our visit we were keen to do some shopping and so many of the great stores were right on our doorstep so when the bags got too heavy, it was easy to drop back.
One issue I did have was the lack of a safe in the room, it is a very long time since I stayed in any hotel that did not have a safe so was disappointed with this. There are safes at reception that you can use but they are very small and it is quite inconvenient as you have to go to reception every time you wan to use.

"“Great hotel!” I recently enjoyed a 7 night stay at the New Yorker at the end of May 2012. I had read some disappointing reviews but I was definitely pleasantly surprised. I had read that a $300 deposit was required when you arrived which was back in our account within 7-10 working days and so we were well prepared. We were upgraded to a room with a view without even having to ask, free of charge by Janette who was very helpful. We had a spacious room on the 19th floor overlooking Madison Square Gardens and the cleaners were in every day. They usually did their rounds around 8am.

"“NOT an upscale hotel” Just got back from a 6 night stay in this hotel. 
PROS: 
+Location- great to have Penn Station and shopping so close.
+View- If you ask for a higher floor facing east (Empire State Building) the view is amazing. 
+Gift Shop- Very reasonable prices
+Free breakfast- Nice to be able to grab something quick and free before running out for the day. The view from the 39th floor breakfast area was a perfect beginning to the morning. The gentleman who runs the breakfast area was one of the nicest people in the hotel
CONS:
-Shoebox size room. One tiny window with a desk in front of it makes it difficult to enjoy the view. 
-Disgustingly old tiny bathroom. The water wouldn't stay the right temperature. No vanity to place more than a few things.

You can basically see the Empire State Building as you leave the hotel....
Just about 15 minutes walk from The Rockefeller Building... Easy Access to transport to the Statue of Libert and Ground zero!!

"“Excellent hotel” Arrived back from spending 6 nights at the hotel. I was traveling with my 14 year old daughter. We paid to upgrade to a view room and were delighted that were allocated a large corner room with a wonderful view of the Empire state building. We found the hotel very comfortable and clean. Were disappointed that couldn't get in to have breakfast at the tick tock diner one morning (we were a group of 6 but the communication from the head waiter to seat us wasn't brilliant) however had been happy with the tick tock when they delivered room service on the first night and my daugter and i ate there on another evening. The area in the lobbly selling coffee/ muffins etc for breakfast was very good and it was nice to be able to sit in lobby and eat this if we wanted a quick breakfast option. The hotel was also in a briliant location to see manhattan. We walked to times square frequently and it was about 10 mins. It always felt very safe walking back even at night. The hotel was also ideally situated to explore the southern sites (liberty island, Ellis, china town etc).

"“central Manhattan” We have just returned from our stay at the New Yorker Hotel and have nothing but praise and compliments for the hotel and staff. Yes it is very busy nearly all the time but if you dont like this sort of environment tou probably wont be wanting to stay in New York anyway. The hotel is ideally situated very close to Empire State Building and within easy walking distance to Broadway and Central Park. There is a subway train station just outside the hotel so other destinations are also easy reached. The Tick Tock Diner located within the Hotel is also very good for that quick easy meal when you dont want to leave the hotel premises to eat, we didnt experience any of these lengthy delays some other people seem to have had, and all the food was very good. 
My only complaint would be that our room was rather small, but that is apparently because we booked through Expedia, that use the smallest rooms in the hotel. I know the other rooms are much larger as I have stayed at the hotel previously. 
So to sum up, a very enjoyable stay at the hotel, good value, but probably wouldnt use Expidia again to handle the booking.",gnhCambridge,2012-06-01,122005,2012-06-14,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Good location and staff” This is huge, old hotel right next to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. It's been renovated back to its art deco glory. The lowest price room that I got had a queen bed, flat screen TV, and older but clean and functional bathroom. It was fine for a just a place to sleep for a solo traveler, which I was, and the price was reasonable for NYC. Not a great room if you want to spend time in it. I would opt for a larger view room, but of course there's more cost.
When I checked out, I left my iPad charging in the wall. It wasn't until hours later, when I was already on the bus out of town, that i realized it, because the hotel security sent email about an item left in the room.

"“Nice Staff and Nice Location” Wife and I stayed here for 5 nights on my first trip to the Big Apple. The location is ideal for first time visitors, as there is a subway stop literally outside the front door, and Penn Station is no more than one block away, making travel out of the city convenient as well as a starting point for navigating the subway.
The front desk staff were helpful and accomodating. The person did her best to get us a room as high up as possible with the best view. I was very excited until she said ""you booked the smallest rooms we have."" Being my first trip to New York, I didn't quite grasp the concept of small until we got in the room. Very small but very clean and well kept.
The rooms were cleaned, sometimes twice daily and we always had what was necessary. We didn't really spend any time in the room unless we were sleeping, so the size of the room wasn't a huge deal. 
There are a lot of different languages and accents from the guests, but the staff took good care of us and let us stow our bags on our last day until our bus departed. Overal I was satisfied with my experience but just wish I would have gotten a little more ""room"" for the price we paid.

"“Fantastic Hotel” New Yorker Hotel
We arrived in Newark Airport, New York on 26th May 2012.
It was super easy to get the train to Penn Station and when we walked out of the station we could not believe how close we were to the New Yorker hotel.
The New Yorker hotel looked stunning and the short 2 min walk from Penn Station was made even better with the sight of the Empire State building just down the road!
This was a fantastic hotel to stay at - there is no doubt that we would stay here again the next time we visit the big apple.
The room was immaculate, bed was comfy- small room, but from what I hear all rooms in New York are small so we expected this.
We were on the 37th floor with a view over the river and part of the city (amazing!)
Attached to the hotel is the Tick Tock Diner which is open 24 hours and besides being really handy it serves great food at reasonable prices!
The New Yorker Hotel is a great base to see the city sights  - you can easily walk to Empire, Time Square...... or hop on the subway to get pretty much anywhere in minutes.
Can't wait to go back!! :-)

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was clean - every day and with fresh towels. The size room was good as well. I don't understand why people complain about the sizes of the rooms when really you are only using for sleeping! The Tick Tock diner next door to the hotel was good as well - always went there first thing in the morning. The sizes of the meals in the diner meant I didn't have to eat until dinner time.

As a sole traveller arriving at the New Yorker Hotel I was pleased with the location.
I travel first class and always look for 5 star hotels, given the placement of hotel there was nothing standard about this fine traditional looking building.
On first view the hotel could look a tad dated, but i can assure you once inside the security and amenities are pretty damn good, id say value for money and as I mentioned as a solo tourist I felt welcomed and the atmosphere was friendly knowledgeable and on hand.
I was welcomed with a double room smaller than i have been used to however it was clean, comfortable and well presented and throughout my stay i felt rested and safe.
I took to eating in the main resturant and the new york steak has yet to be been beaten, the portions are large and id guess great to share.

"“Good experience” Got a booking off hotwire.com for the Memorial Day weekend and we were pleasantly surprised. The decor of the hotel retains some of that old style New York charm that everyone loves. Location is fantastic - diagonally across the Penn Station which makes the subway easily accessible. In those lovely spring months, it'll be great to take a walk to Times Square and Herald Square from the hotel. 
We were lucky to have our request granted for a high floor (31st). The room was handicap-enabled so it was supposedly larger than normal. There was ample space to have two luggages open. No cramped feeling, and generally clean. Free wifi throughout the hotel was a major plus, seeing as how the modern crowd appreciate connectivity. 
The only downside was that the hotel was packed due to the holidays, and the line was served by only 2 front desk staff, which made the wait unnecessarily long. In spite of that the staff remained courteous, so no complaints there.

"“The new Yorker!!” Stayed at this fabulous hotel in March 2012 for a week while exploring New York.Perfect location,being near enough the river to walk and catch the river taxi,go on the river trips..also central enough to walk to Broadway and see a show and take time out in times square,also just minutes away from Macy's if that tickles your fancy.
The hotel itself is old but modern if that makes sense,the room we were in (2 of us) was comfortable quite basic but it's all that was needed..after a long day walking all you want is a shower/bath and a comfy bed..definitely ticked both boxes there (pillows were lush).They have a diner(the tick tock) just down off the lobby for breakfast/food,,but there's plenty of places around, and again all within walking distance.

"“Great stay, perfect location” I stayed at the New Yorker with my husband for 7 days mid May, we both had a wonderful time, we were out most of the day so mainly used the room as a place to crash or have a mid afternoon rest before venturing out again. The location is fantastic, within walking distance to all major sites and very close to subways and buses.
The room was very clean and modern, we stayed on the 23rd floor (room 2333) and had a great view of the Empire State building out of our window!! :o) Didn't have any issues with street noise as we were so high up. Ok, the rooms are on the small side especially compared to European standards, but space is at a premimum in New York and I have heard that most NYC hotels have tiny rooms so was kind of expecting this. However, we were given two double beds for no extra charge which was handy as it meant that our room was bigger than average. The bathroom was a little dated but served its purpose and had lots of toiletries and towels (wish they had proper bath towels rather than lots of small hand towels, but that's me being picky) never had any issues with hot water as some other guests mentioned. All the staff we came to contact with were very pleasant and friendly and check in and check out was fast. There are a number of lifts in the lobby which service this massive hotel, they were very efficient and you rarely had to wait long to catch one.
Breakfast was not included, but with so many restaurants and cafes around, this was not a problem- loved Jumba juice bar- gorgeous smoothies and they do a tasty egg and spinich toasted tortilla wrap - yum!! We tried out the Tic Toc Diner for breakfast one time (diner attached to the hotel) after hearing so many good reviews. Once was enough, it was ok, but very average. There are much better places out there for a better price. We tried out Ellen's Stardust Diner for the experience one lunch time, it was very cheesy, but had a great fun factor with wannabe theatical performers singing tracks from popular Broadway shows whilst you eat, worth going and try the milkshakes- 1000's of calories but VERY nice. (on 1650 Broadway). For a nice dinner try Ruby Tuesdays- on 7th Ave (between 41st/42nd St) we had the most delicious steak which cut through like butter, great staff and they even gave us free starter as we waited 'long' (only 15 mins!). 'Vergils' steak house on the otherhand not so good, humongeous portions (one starter and main shared -main only half eaten) huge but not great quality, we found the meat to be overly salty and fatty.
Top of the Rock (Rockerfeller Center) very worth seeing and is better than Empire State building, look up 'High line' park on top of a dis-used railway track about 6 meters above ground level, very unique. BB's jazz club worth popping into.

"“Best Manhattan hotel for its price and location” I've stayed here several times, and will continue to come back. On my last visit the check-in agent at the counter upgraded us to the 32nd floor (highest floor for regular rooms before the penthouse/suite levels) for free, and went out of his way to get us every discount he could, resulting in essentially a free night's stay. Our bill was only about 75% of what we had planned on.
The location can't be beat, we walked absolutely everywhere, thus hotel is very central to most attractions on Manhattan. The rooms are small, but that is to be expected in New York.

"“Room was tiny” I loved mostly everything about this hotel. The location is about as good as it gets and having the Tik Tok Diner attached is a major plus! Most subway lines are within a block walk from the hotel too. Also, security asks to see your room key and that is a major plus! And FYI, there is a great pizza place, a Wendy's, BK and a McDonald's within a block if your looking for cheap food right there. We got a full size bed that nearly took up our entire room. My feet hung off the end of the bed and was probably the worst nights sleep I'd ever had on any vacation. The bathroom was a joke. It reminded me of a rest stop bathroom with a tub in it. Next time I'll just pay the extra $50 per night and stay somewhere better. The fact that the room I got wasn't even an option on their website makes me feel as if I was mislead!!! I was expecting a Metro room since it seems the most basic of rooms listed but I got a full size bed.

"“Never Again” We chose the hotel for its location - which is excellent - and it's architectural style - the lobby is magnificent - and that for me is where the positives end. Nobody greeted us to see if we needed assistance with luggage; the check-in staff were rude and we were left to find our own way to our rooms. The room was tiny with a double bed, only one bedside table as there wasn't room for two, a tiny wardrobe that wasn't deep enough for a hanger and nowhere to put luggage. The brochure we chose from misled us into believing that the rooms have safes and fridges - they don't. The bathroom was tiny and shabby and, whilst the fittings were clean, the tiles and paintwork were not and it really needs serious updating with its chipped and peeling paint and stained floors. It was impossible to maintain a stable temperature with the shower taps and the plumbing was very noisy. Our room had the added bonus of a view of a wall and noise from garbage trucks. The security staff and the housekeeping staff were polite but housekeeping did remove the extra towels I asked for before I even had chance to use them. The TV remote didn't work so obviously had not been checked. The air conditioning was difficult to regulate. The hairdryer would have taken a fortnight to dry my hair and there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. The Tick Tock Diner attached to the hotel was alright but expensive and always busy. When we checked out they charged us to store luggage, which went into the bell hop's pocket rather than allow the customer to tip. Again on check out we weren't offered any assistance with lugage. The hotel was very expensive and definitely did not provide value for money. I often think that we can learn much about customer service from the USA, sadly the New Yorker appears to be the exception that proves the rule. We have a saying in the north of England of 'all fur coat and no knickers' and if you understand what that means then that sums up this hotel for me. I will never stay there again and I would never recommend it.",Gail W,2012-05-01,122005,2012-05-26,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.9,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location but just know the rooms are small.” The New Yorker is one of the historic hotels in Manhattan for sure. On the corner of 34th and 8th it's just a half block away from Penn Station and the Madison Square Garden which makes it a great place to stay just for the ease of access to the train and subway station.
The lobby is quite expansive and seemingly always filled with people. A lot of European tourists book this hotel as there are always many different languages being spoken. Check in was efficient and easy. There are two banks of elevators. The set on the left are for the lower floors to 19 and the right bank is for 20 and up. There are a lot of elevators so the wait times are usually quite short even with a lot of people in the hotel.
The hallways and rooms are definitely old style and could do with an update but they also probably add to the historic ""decor"". The rooms as I noted in my title are definitely small. This is the second time I've stayed here and it still shocked me a bit when I opened the door and the bed was essentially right there. Now, having said that, it's not as small as some places I've stayed at in Japan.
My room had a single queen sized bed, two night tables, set of drawers and a desk to work at. There is a proper closet albeit deep and not wide. The washroom is also on the small side with a pedestal sink, toilet and a tub. Luckily the tub/shower did have one of the curved shower rods to push the curtain away when taking a shower. It does have very powerful water pressure but also one of the loudest shower heads I've ever heard.
There is a flat screen TV in the room with some HD channels. It is one of the smaller flat screens I've ever seen in a hotel room but it goes with the rest of the room size.
There is a bar in the lobby next to the reception area and we've had drinks here before but not food so I can't tell you if it's good to eat there or not. But, given the number of great restaurants in Manhattan I think you'd be better going out anyway.
Some of the rooms do look down into an area where they store the garbage bins so you do hear the trunks come in the middle of the night to pick them up. I believe anything ending in 62.
Overall it is a decent hotel to stay at especially given the deals that can be had.",warmhappyfeet,2012-05-01,122005,2012-05-25,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

We were upgraded to an amazing corner room with fabulous views of the ESB and the New York skyline. Having the 24 tick tock diner was perfect and we eat there on several occasions. We could not fault the New Yorker in any way. We are already recommending the New Yorker to all our friends and family and I know that we will return to the New Yorker for another holiday.

"“It is what it is...” In a town where you pay through the nose for lodging, its nice to have a place like the New Yorker (well located near transit and good value) to fall back on. 
Its an older hotel that has been renovated throughout. That means smaller rooms... but still very reasonable by NYC standards. 
Given the size of the hotel, understandably the finishings aren't as nice as a boutique hotel. For example, we stayed in a Metro room... which is fairly small and has a bathroom that has had minimal upgrades (new shower curtain and mirror + faucet fixtures... but thats about it). But again, given the price you'll be paying, its well worth it.
The only down-sides we experienced during our stay was some really loud banging (and I mean room-shaking banging) at night. Also, again beacuse its an older property, the sound insulation isn't the best.
In sum, all things considered... and because you're in NYC... it was a good base-camp for our 2 weeks in the city. Stay here, save your money and spend it on more worthwhile things.",ArtYee,2012-04-01,122005,2012-05-23,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Brilliant hotel if it's your first time in NYC!” This was my first ever trip to NY and we spent hours trawling through reviews for lots of hotels so hopefully this review will help convince first time NY travelers like us!
First of all, I want to say that the location of this hotel was brilliant! We went for a week and wanted to do all the tourist stuff and everything was in adequate walking distance which is ideal for money saving. The staff at the hotel were lovely and welcoming and they were full of helpful tips and advice with where to go and how to get there, that sort of thing.
The hotel in itself was brilliant for the price we paid. Its not your top-class $2000 a night but its more than able to suit needs. The rooms were clean, light and had good air conditioning which was vital for NY in summer. The beds were comfortable and, for the city that never sleeps, I managed to get a good nights sleep and was never disturbed by people in the corridors or the people out on the streets.
Overall, its important to feel comfortable in the knowledge of getting a good hotel for a first trip to somewhere so iconic and I really believe that The New Yorker is a great place to start,",Charlotte C,2011-07-01,122005,2012-05-23,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Birthday Trip” The Hotel New Yorker is an old hotel with lots of character and history. We had a great time in New York and it was made extra special by the helpful staff at the Hotel New Yorker. Mohammed who greeted us on arrival at the reception desk was fantastic, very helpful he was aware that it was my wifes birthday having previously emailed the hotel. They organised a corner room overlooking the Empire State Building with some choclates even though the Hotel was full. They were quick to send items to our room even late at night such as tea & Coffee. The Concierge was honest about pricing. The hotel is clean and in good order and not a noisy hotel. They have a diner attached that is open 24 hours a day and serves good food. No swimming pool though. Access to the the main sites from the hotel is easy, either walking or the underground. There is a ticket booth in Time square that sells half price theatre tickets to most of the Broadway shows well worth a 20 minute wait. They have a transport desk that can organise a car to take you to the airport just watch the time of day as the traffic can be terrible. We went to a baseball game 'NY Mets' that was great fun easy to get to, they run faster underground trains to the stadium and ticket prices start from $5 it is worth paying a bit more to sit behind the plate higher up in the stand.",kevin h,2012-05-01,122005,2012-05-23,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

After sightseeing all day and trying to wash up before bed, it seemed as though they turned off the hot water each night--maybe it just took so long for the hot water to come out that it made us think they turned it off!

My only bad experience is with the driver assistance thing offered. Its quite a lot more expencive than the yellow cabs. Yes, you know you'll get a car and all that but....

"“Location, location, location” We stayed here for nine nights after reading dozens of reviews on TripAdvisor and elsewhere. We found the hotel as described by most here. The outstanding thing about this hotel is its location it is fabulous for the New York visitor. Times Square, Broadway theatres and shopping are all an easy walk. There are dozens of diners, coffee shops and restaurants close, in fact everything in midtown is close by and being so near to Penn Station and the subway makes getting around everywhere else simple. But none of that would matter if the hotel was below expectations. We found it a very comfortable place to stay. Our room was on the 29th floor in a corner so while it was hike to the lifts it was pretty quiet as we only had two rooms near us and no one above us. The room itself was clean and comfortable, the bed was fantastic. As many have said here the bathroom was a bit used but even though it was a bit ""lived in"" it too was clean and had everything we needed. The night we arrived the hot water for the whole hotel was not working which is not what you want to hear after 30 hours and two very long flights. But when it was fixed it was pretty good. The Tick Tock diner was OK but the bar off the foyer was excellent, they made a great old fashioned but order a Manhattan, its the best I've ever had and the food was pretty good as well. The staff we had contact with were all friendly and helpful. we loved the art deco touches and the history of the place is pretty amazing.

"“1st trip to NYC” This was our first trip to NYC and we were hesitant to stay here not knowing the geographic area. Turns out it was fabulous. We were directly kitty corner to Madison Square Gardens which is over top of Penn Station. So take the train from the airport. If I had it to do over I would. The Empire State Building was right down the street, and we were only a 10 - 15 minute walk to time square. The Room itself was one of the smallest I've ever stayed in, but the bed was very comfortable, and we didn't plan on spending that much time in the room anyways. When we checked in the lady behind the counter was so friendly, she gave us tips on streets to avoid, where to eat, where to get tickets/discounts. All the staff was great. There were no in room safes, but they did have the old bank style safety deposit boxes in a room off the front desk with 24 hours access. We didn't care for the breakfast from the restaurant on site, so we ate at the McDonalds for breakfast each day which was directly across the street. On the day we were to leave, I noticed the airline had broken my suitcase and the only option I had was to duct tape it together until I got to the airport. The staff in their mail room were very helpful, offering to give me what I needed at no charge, and helped where they could. I would definitely stay here again.",tracyk03,2012-05-01,122005,2012-07-02,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“A good place to stay in NYC” As mentioned in other posts we always look for value for dollar when travelling. This is VERY hard to do in New York City. This we realized before booking our trip. Having said that our stay at The New Yorker was comfortable, clean and located perfectly for a 'tourista' in the Big Apple. We were lucky enough to have a suite which was well maintained by the housekeeping staff and was obviously much larger than they standard rooms which we did view and which were quite small. We enjoyed all the amenities at the New Yorker Hotel and the only negative that I can report was the front desk staff. Most travelers are accustomed to good (if not superb) customer service from hotel front desk staff. This was not the case at the New Yorker: both on check in and check out and at one other time when we visited the front desk we found the staff to have really poor customer service skills. Not overly helpful, not friendly, not thankful for your business .... just poor service. Maybe this was because they were extremely busy every time we were there or maybe it's just because it was New York. Overall, we enjoyed the hotel and would return but I wouldn't expect any superior service.",BEC053,2012-05-01,122005,2012-07-02,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“ideal location” Being in Midtown you can get to anywhere in Manhattan easily. Many places are walkable but if you need the subway it is just at the end of the block and you are almost opposite Penn Station if you want to go further afield. The room was a little small but very clean and quiet and the bed was very comfortable. Decor throughout was in keeping with the age and style of the building. Plenty of lifts available at all times. In-store shop had souvenirs at better prices than in town. My only criticism is the lack of tea & coffee making facilities in the room- though these are always available in the foyer. The staff were always friendly and helpful. The restaurant attached to the hotel does a good early evening deal for $20 and the food is lovely- not all chips! I would recommend the diner 1 block down for a hearty and inexpensive breakfast.,SheilaNewark_Notts,2012-05-01,122005,2012-05-20,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great location” We were originally booked to stay in Hotel Pennsylvania, but it was so horrific we only lasted there one night. We had heard good things about The New Yorker so booked straight in there. It was lovely, just what we expected from a decent hotel in New York, modern, clean and comfortable. 
The location was perfect! Opposite the hotel was a Mc Donald's/TGI/Starbucks and Penn station was just over the road which turned out to really useful for the journey to the airport! I would definetly recommend using the LIRR to the airport, much cheaper and faster then a yellow cab!",parkyy2k,2012-02-01,122005,2012-05-18,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Location” Stayed for 4 nights with my friend on girls holiday, both our first visit to New York. Hotel was lovely very old school, only issue is few floors seemed to have rennovations into apartments which does kind of take away the old school glamour of this building. Rooms nice and tidy, very keeping with style of hotel. Had no view but for a wall but i suppose you dont come to New York to look out the window. Hotel Diner was superb, quick service, lots of variety, staff so friendly we bumped into a waiter one day just walking around and he introduced us to his whole family...so sweet!! 
Location is fantastic, opposite madison square gardens so subway right next door. Quick 2 minute walk to Macys and Empire State Building. New York is so easy to walk around and find your own little hidden gems, i stumbled across a Marc Jacobs sample sale in Greenwich Village much to my banks dismay!! 
Would definatly stay at this hotel again, great location, fantastic style and ideal to see all that manhatten beholds.

"“Spectacular Hotel” Recently stayed at the New Yorker, we upgraded to the Empire State Building View room which I have to say is well worth the extra money. View was spectacular. Location of hotel is great very central, short walk to Times Square, Macys, Madison Square Gardens & Empire State Building. There is a fantastic diner attached to the hotel which is open 24 hours a day!! Breakfasts are reasonably priced and delicious. Portion sizes are huge! If you don't want to eat there 8th avenue is littered with places to eat. Great location for the tube also as it is next to Penn Station. Staff were mostly helpful however one of the men on the transport desk was very abrupt when asked a simple question. Room itself was nicely decorated however the bathroom could do with an upgrade to bring it in line with the rest of the room.

"“4 night stay at New Yorker hotel, New York, NY” Had a very eventful 4 night stay at the New Yorker hotel. The hotel is very well situated for all the main tourist attractions, only a 5 minute walk to Times Square. The Coopers Tavern restaurant adjoined to the hotel was very nice and great value. The adjoining Ticck Tock diner was great for a quick breakfast. The rooms are small but serviceable for a short visit, and as we were out sightseeing every day this did not pose a massive issue. The rooms were clean but the main reception area was very cold, and was uncomfortable to sit in for any length of time. During our stay we had the misfortune of experiencing a real fire alarm at 5am! The fire evacuation was not well executed in my opinion, as I did not see a member of staff until I reached the lobby from the 22nd floor. There were no staff members on our level to lead us to an emergency exit, and guests were not reassured. All of the guests ended up gathered right at the entrance to the hotel on the street and many actually stayed sitting in the lobby. We were not well informed as to the nature of the fire and did not feel reassured at all. We enjoyed our short stay in New York, however we would consider whether to stay at the New Yorker again.",Ruth M,2012-06-01,122005,2012-07-01,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Excellent location for sightseeing” We recently stayed two nights and although the room was small it was adequate for our weekend stopover. It was in a great location for seeing as much as possible in a very short space of time. We were really only there to sleep. It was great to have wifi as we were able to keep in touch with family and friends. The bath was old and dated but served its purpose. The staff were friendly and helpful and there were food options available. Taxis were very handy being just outside the front door. The hop in hop off buses were close by as were the theatres. We felt very safe walking to and from the hotel!

"“Great place to stay in the Big Apple!” A friend and I travelling to NYC for my birthday stayed here for 3 nights at the end of April. We were in a room with two double beds on the 19th floor and we had a view of the Empire State Building and MSG. The room wasn't huge but it was perfect for what we needed it for. Everything was very clean and the cleaning ladies did a great job every day. We arrived early so our room wasn't ready but we were able to leave our bags and start exploring the city right away. When we did get checked in, the girl that was helping us (Ruth) made sure that we had a room with a view and also gave me a little box of truffles when she found out that it was my birthday! There are no safes in the room but you can use a lock box located at the front desk for free. When it was time to check out, we were able to again leave our bags and head out for the day as our flight wasn't leaving until later that evening. The friendly staff also helped us arrange hassle-free transportation to the airport. We did have breakfast one morning at the tick-tock dinner. The food was fast, hot and not to badly priced either! There is a great little gift shop in the basement of the hotel near the work-out room that is actually cheaper than many of the gift shops in the area! Everything was within walking distance and Penn station is across the street if you want to take the subway anywhere. Overall, the hotel was great and I would not hesitate to stay there again and recommend it to others.

"“Nice stay however, it is the little things” As a frequent traveler seeing large, very noticeable hairs on my pillow and towel is frankly disgusting.

"“Great location, good friendly service” We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. All the staff have been polite & helpful. They responded swiftly to our email enquiries prior to our arrival and followed up all our requests at check in without prompting. 
We decided to upgrade to a room with a view and although small it had the promised view of the Empire State building & other iconic Manhattan land marks. As I said the room was small but when all we wanted to do is sleep in it, it was more than adequate. The bed was comfortable & the air con blissful! The bathroom was also on the small side and the only negative thing about our stay was the shower temperature fluctuated a lot! Which made for an interesting shower! 
The housekeeping staff were lovely & whenever we saw them, enquired if we needed anything else. 
We never had to wait more than a few minutes to get a lift to the lobby, we were on the 31st floor. 
We used the Tick Tock diner on numerous occasions for breakfast, dinner & cake and were very impressed. The staff are pleasant & the service is very efficient. It is great diner food with generous portions. We can thoroughly recommend the Fudgy Wudgy Chocolate cake !
The hotel is in a fantastic location, literally five minutes from Macy's, 10 minutes to the Empire State Building, Times Square and many other tourist attractions. We walked a lot but the subway is just outside the hotel. 
The concierge booked us two dinner & show packages for Stomp & One Man Two Guvnors, these were great value & great seats. Although opt for Alfredos as a place to eat over Jacks.

"“Brilliant location” Lets start from the beginning. The taxi ride from JFK will cost you $46. Beware of the unlicensed taxi drivers touting for business. Take the yellow cabs. The hotel is an excellent location. On the corner of 34th street and 8th. Directly opposite Madison Square Gardens. About a 10 min walk from Empire states and 15-20 from Times Square. The location is superb. Subway is directly opposite the corner of the Hotel.
Now if you are looking for a spectacular rooms with all the mod cons, this is not it. Dont get me wrong the rooms are fine, clean and tidy, but the hotels location is its best feature, not the accommodation. On saying that, it suited us fine. We just wanted a base. There were three adults sharing the room and it was a little cramped, but still no real problems.
Try for an upgrade to a suite, which would fit three better. None available when we got there.
Staff are very friendly, despite the fact its a busy hotel. The Bar was good, plenty of selection and good place to chill after long day out on your feet. Food was also good there and well priced.
The Tick Tock restaurant, which is attached, was great and good place to start your day for breakfast. Dont be put off by the long line, it soon recedes.
Also used the Gym on the lower level. Which was good

"“Old, dusty and needs a renovation” The hotel is in the heart of manhattan, you can see the Empire State Building and The Time Square from many hotel rooms. Our room was in the 34th floor and very quiet.
But the hotel just takes profit from its perfect position, otherwise, I think, nobody would stay here again.
The room really doesn't smell good and needs an urgent renovation. The bathrooms are out of the question and the toilet hasn't been renewed for about 20 years. It is very overpriced and can't meet the demands of a hotel of the first rate.
The promoted breakfast is very very poor, you get one croissant or bagel and a cup of juice or coffee, that's all...

"“GREAT VALUE GREAT SERVICE” Just returned from The New Yorker Hotel today and have found it to be a great place to stay. Its location is right in the middle of midtown so you can walk to a show , macys or to the empire state building within 10-15 mins. subway is outside too and you can get a direct train uptown to central park , 5th avenue shops and the museum mile or downtown to 911 memorial wall street etc. Port Authority Bus terminal is about 10 mins walk too.
We also booked a boat trip which goes from pier 74 which took us 15 mins to walk to so all in all its very central.
 Plus a great place for breakfast on the next corner of 33rd st (on 8th Ave) called Stage Door does fantastic breakfasts all day great service too.
The hotel is 1930s built and has been kept in that style so the lobby elevators rooms etc are all art deco styled. The lobby seems to be exactly as it probably was when it was built and has info desk (very helpful) and concierge until 730pm every night. There is also a security guard who will ask to see your room key when you approach the elevators.The rooms we stayed in was 3430. overlooking hudson river (back of the hotel). There is no getting away from the fact that it was pretty small but it was cleaned daily beds very nice. comfortable. good pillows and quite a high bed which i liked.
Housekeeping made the bed everyday and the bathroom was kept spotless. I was very impressed. There is a flat screen tv alarm clock full size iron and board . My only complaint would be that the hairdryer was rubbish ! but thats the only thing .

It was great for getting ready in the morning when all needed to use bathrooms at same time. Room was very clean, serviced every day by very friendly house keeping staff. 
We ate in Tick Tock for breakfast every day and had dinner twice there and had lots of ta coffee's.
It was ideal for us as the menu had something to suit every one.
Location of the hotel is ideal. the ACE lines stop right outside the hotel and one block over on 7th the 123 stopped so never far to walk for any where we needed to get to on the subway.
You could easily walk to Time Sq from hotel

"“Fantastic stay...GREAT location” I stayed there one night in March 2012, so I wouldn't have to drive 3 hours home after a late night club show in the City. Passed the place plenty of times over the years, but have never stayed there. The place came recommended to me from a co-worker, so I gave it a shot. As it was the off tourist season, the room was priced cheaper. You won't get these rates in the summer or between Thanksgiving and Christmas. We were upgraded to a larger room than expected. Fantastic amenities AND a view of New Jersey LOL (I am from Jersey). Check in was a breeze, for an extra dollar I left one bag and went wandering around the city before my train out that night. The bathroom fixtures are a little dated, but that is to be expected in Manhattan and esecially in an older building. The elevators were quick. As far as location, you can't beat 1 block from the train station at Penn Station and 8 blocks from Times Square, 2 blocks from the Empire State Building, and down the street from Macys if you are going up for the tourist thing.

"“Gorgeous art deco, clean and friendly.” We have just returned from our 4 night stay at The New Yorker. We had an wonderful experience. The hotel was clean, tidy, the staff were friendly, and very helpful. Our room although not very big did have 2 double beds, dated but clean and tidy bathroom. Wide screen tv, which we only saw little of - too busy to see the sights. This hotel is excellently situated on 8th avenue. Our view which initially I thought was dissappointing, as i could see a lot of brick directly across from the window, actually looked over Madison Square garden. It was handy for the underground, the station directly round the corner. We decided to go for a walk, to Times Square - just turn left outside the hotel doors, walk straight and you'll be there in about 20 mins! About $5 in a cab. (new York taxi drivers drive like formula 1 racers, thought I might die at one stage!!!!) this hotel is situated across the road from McDonald's and Starbucks, disappointed it didn't have any tea or coffee making facilities though. The tick tock diner serves great food, a breakfast there set us up for the day! Breakfast is about $15 dollars each - for a full breakfast. Dinner will cost you $20 - 30 each, with a drink. I didn't find eating out very cheap at all during my stay. We ended up having breakfast in McDonald's a couple of mornings! I would definitely recommend this hotel. Also, the chambermaid was lovely, and always made our beds beautifully, even putting my daughters teddy on the bed when she was done! Nice touch. Air con in the room was fab, it felt very warm a couple of nights we were away, so was very welcomed by us!

"“Disappointed” Hotel promised renovated rooms, but that's not the same as painting old tiles... Grimy looking bathroom and old carpet gave a worn-down feeling. The in-room blow-dryer caught fire...

"“Great location and good value - would stay again” My girlfriend and I stayed for 5 nights in April 2012 and the hotel was all we were hoping. It was clearly at its best in the 60's, and perhaps a little aged, but the place was clean and comfortable and the staff were very helpful. The New Yorker is in a great location, right next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station and a short walk from Times Square. We had a room on the 33rd floor which had a nice view across lower Manhattan too.
The hotel also has free wifi and access to safe deposit boxes behind reception.
The standard double room was a fair size, but with two big suitcases, got a little cramped; easily remedied when I realised there was a walk-in wardrobe (/closet) though. The only real downside was the shower - if you can call it a shower! It was hard to get the correct temperature (ie not burning of freezing) and it was no better than a low-powered hosepipe. Honestly seen better showers in changing rooms at away matches on a Saturday afternoon.
If you are looking for a clean, safe and comfortable base for your central NYC trip, do it; if you are looking to spend all the time in your room, perhaps look elsewhere.",mrtomnoble,2012-04-01,122005,2012-05-12,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“The New Yorker Well Recommended.” The New Yorker is situated in one of the Hotspots of Nyc,its very convinent and is only minutes away from Times Square,Its also right by the Subway Penn Station which is very handy for getting about. Me and my brother stayed there for seven nights and had no problems,The place was clean and friendly,the only encounter we did have was one of the ladIes at reception was quite moody,but she could of just been havin a bad day.
Our stay was enjoyable,i would say traffic noise wasnt a problem for us as we were situated high up on 27th floor.One thing i would say was the room was smaller than i thought would be ,but everything was fine.I was very suprised to find a birthday card and complimentry chocolate truffels from the staff,which was very thoughtful and a lovely suprise.
One handy thing they do there is they can hold your luggage for you on your last day and only cost a dollar a bag and you can pick it up when you want.
Generally all the staff were friendly and polite and i would recommend staying there.

"“Rude jimmy” Stayed at the new Yorker for 4 nights in march, it was our first time in new York when we reached the hotel we were shattered, when we went to check in we were met with a very ignorant man called jimmy who said your room isnt ready come back in two hours, i went back one hour later and spoke to a lovely lady who was very understanding and got us a room straight away. 
We were pleased with our room but would have liked a better view so we went down to reception to see about getting an upgrade, once again it was jimmy who said ""you can't get a better view because the people that have these rooms have paid more money than you"" I explained I was willing to pay extra but he just said 'well no rooms are available' great holiday spoiled by one rude man.

"“Good location, an option for the right price” Stayed at the New Yorker for 5 nights last week. The location is great if you are in the city as a first/ second time tourist that wants to be between all the big sights. Time Square, Empire State building, Macy's and a subway stop are all within an easy walk. 
The lobby is small for a hotel of this size, and the front desk staff ranged from mildly polite, to indifferent.The TicToc Diner is a decent place to grab breakfast, and fairly inexpensive for a hotel restaurant.
The room was small, as are most in New York. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom, manageable. THere was no place to sit, and there was no safe, which is a really big deal for me. 
If you can get a good price, around 200.00 it's worth it. If you're having to pay 300+ there are better options.
Tip-we had a corporate rate for our first 3 nights, and then had to switch to a high rack rate for the additional 2 nights.(back to back reservations, same room) The day before our new reservation was to take affect we checked the hotel web site for the price for that weekend. It had gone down considerably. The front desk staff would not help in changing the rate, but did let us cancel which enabled us to quickly re-book on the internet for the cheaper rate. This saved over 200 for the weekend. check your cancellation policy before doing this",travelforlife5,2012-05-01,122005,2012-05-10,False,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

 Our room (2711) was small but who goes to new york to sit in the hotel room. it was clean and was cleaned daily and fresh towels supplied if required. just the base we needed to head out sight seeing and shopping. 
 the tick tock dinner is the ideal place to have breakfast and plan your day, it does get busy and the staff are a bit rushed now and again but the food is worth the wait.
the only down side i had was a waitress told me to leave twice the tax for a tip so she was telling me how much tip to give her.
coopers is good to relax in on an evenig for a quiet drink but the staff i found where not great and drinks are hotel prices, so above local. 
the location of the hotel was ideal. just around the corner from macy's and the empire state building, and over the road from maddison square garden. penn station is on the doorstep. broadway and times square are only a short walk away, but there are allways taxis outside the front door or see the staff to get a limo syle car.

The room was a bit cramped but was very nice. Had a great view and it is central for Empire State Building, Macys and Times Square. We decided to go see a show and arranged with the hotel to book tickets. Was told they charged a booking fee and was quite prepared to pay this. Each ticket cost $129.99 and when I picked them up at the hotel the face value of the tickets were $62. Couldn't beleive they had charged more than double the price.

"“Class in the city” The New Yorker is a great art deco hotel right in the heart of New York. Located just a short walk from Time Square, the Empire State building and Central Park making it a great hotel for sigh seers. The entrance hall is original and has all the class of a hotel in its height of the 1920-1930's and has a wow factor that is hard to miss. It also has it's own dinner that gives great value for money, and portions that are as big as the New York buildings (you have been warned). They also have a great restaurant that is not only good value, but does delicious food and fabulous cocktails (well you have to have them - it would be rude not to!). The rooms are not that big, but have plenty of room for what you would need, as well as pillows and a bed that feel like heaven (some of the best nights sleep I have ever had). Most rooms have a view, but the higher you go the better the view - they do take request for a view, but can not promise it. I requested a view and got a great one of the Empire State building - what more could I have asked for! Well there was another bonus, it was just across the road form McDonald's so you could grab a coffee to go before exploring the city that never sleeps. The only down side really is the attraction help desk, as which you can book theatre tickets etc. There only ever seemed to be one person manning it, and a queue of people waiting to be served, so would advise you try and book your theatre tickets, helicopter rides or river cruises before you arrive.",Jason P,2011-08-01,122005,2012-07-15,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The fire was a maids trolley on the 20th floor which was put out and left in the stairwell to which was our fire exit to reception.This exit should have been blocked off to stop guests going down into the smoke and led to other fire exits on the level above but there were no real communication with staff telling guests to get out and other staff saying go back to your rooms as the fire was under control and put out.eventually a fireman guided the guests including us to another exit.

"“Love the New Yorker!” I stayed at the New Yorker from March 21-24. I received the price of $156 on another retail website in which I negotiated priced. When I arrived with my daughter, I decided to ""upgrade"" for $25 dollars more. We arrived at the hotel around noon and was able to check in. That is RARE in NYC. The checkin was smooth and the front desk was busy. I was surprised that bell staff did not at least offer to help us with our bags but I tipped myself instead. 
When we arrived in room 2428, I was surprised! I was amazed on the size of the room in comparison to other NYC hotels. Our room had two bathrooms WHICH I LOVED. There is no waiting for your roomie to get out of the shower. Later, I found that the shower pressure was AMAZING and I wish I could find the toiletries on the market. I had no view, but that it what going outside is for. The TV did not come on, but within 5 minutes somone was in my room resetting it. 
What I loved: Location!!!!! Close to the 1, 2, and 3 and A, B, C lines. 8 blocks from Time Square! 1 block from Madison Square Garden. If I needed a wig, a drugstore or porn they were all nearby. Shopping all around the area. Housekeeping staff was wonderful. Employees greeted me throughout the building in English-the very first experience of that in any hotel. No bedbug issues.
Security! I loved security checking IDs...made me feel like I was a dignitary. I mean I am in my head...but most people don't read my mind.

"“Good value hotel in New York City” I stayed for three nights in a Towers room at this hotel at the end of April 2012. I had read some contradictory reviews about this hotel but in most cases the reviewers had not indicated the specific type of room they stayed in which does not help anyone decide if this hotel is for them.
My review refers only to the Towers rooms which are small suites (seperatate living room and a compact seperate bedroom and compact ensuite bathroom) located on the top three floors (38 to 40).There is a lounge on the 39th floor where a complimentary continental breakfast is served Monday thru Friday, on the weekend a voucher is provided for breakfast in the Tick-Tock diner located within the hotel on the corner of west 34th st and 8th Avenue.
My room was located on the 39th floor and looked directly at the Empire State building located futher along West 34th street.
Check in was efficient if not particularly warm and as I was very early (8am) my room was not available, the previous occupant had not yet left and did not do so until around 12 noon (check out time) at which time reception prioritised my room for cleaning so I could check in.
In the meantime my luggage was stored and I was given the code for the free wifi in the lobby.
The location of the hotel is a little over 1 block from Penn Station where the LIRR from JFK airport arrives, the journey time from Jamaica station is about 20-25 minutes, much quicker and cheaper than a cab or limo service and across the road from Madison Square Garden, an entrance to the subway system is located around the corner from the hotel on west 35th street and gives access to lines A,C and E.
There is a Gym and a Business Centre downstairs from the lobby but I did not use either so cannot comment on them.
Free basic wifi is available throughout the hotel, higher speeds and capacities are available for a fee. No in room safes are provided which is a negative particularly for the rooms in which I stayed but safe deposit boxes are available at reception. Not as good or convenient as an in room safe but better than nothing.
Many restaurants located in the area between the hotel and the Times Square area located around West 42nd street.
This being my first visit to New York I have no point of comparison but from what I have read New York hotels are notorious for very small rooms and very high room rates, in this case I had booked early and my room rate was very reasonable for a room which was quite large and very comfortable with two lcd tv's, a small fridge and a tea/coffee maker. There were seperate air conditioning controls for the living and sleeping areas which is a little unusual.Good storage space with two (small closets) and two sets of drawers.

"“Great location. Clean room. Great view.” We were checked in by a man named Angel. He was very nice. We told him that it was our first time visiting NYC. He noted that the room that we were scheduled to have had been having hot water issues, so he got permission to upgrade us. He told us that the view would be ""the best"". Boy, was it! Great view, hotel room overall clean. The bathroom was clean, but old. Very basic bathroom tub/shower combo, pedestal sink, toilet next to a paper thin lockless door. No fan in the bathroom either. So muggy and hot for a while after everyone showers. Really though, the bathroom was functional and clean, so I was fine. The hotel itself was huge. I wish there was a doorman @ all times. The rotating door was out and we were fighting suction/winds just to get a door open. Angel is the only staff member that we encountered on our 4 day/3 night stay, which to me is odd, but at least he was friendly! Nearby...Drugstore on the opposite corner for anything you forgot.

"“Some great bits - if only the staff knew about customer service.” I am a visitor from Europe who stayed here for seven nights during a conference based at the hotel. The positives : great, central location; Tick Tock Diner very convenient and good food; upgraded room had wonderful view of the Empire State Building and the NYC skyline; bed was very comfortable and the room well soundproofed, giving a comfortable night's sleep; cleaning staff were polite and kept the room spotlessly clean; conference room was large and had good facilities.
Negatives : we were lucky to be upgraded but other colleagues' rooms were very small - one couldn't open her case without putting it on the bed; free Internet connection is incredibly slow - if you want fast you have to pay; several times we couldn't log on as ""there are too many people already connected"" - ridiculous for a conference hotel; one printer in the 'Business Centre' didn't work; alcohol in the diner was ridiculously expensive, even for New York; our waiter in the diner on three separate occasions was inattentive and more interested in chatting to his friends or on his mobile phone than getting our food; the shower was impossible to control - ran either very hot or very cold.
But the biggest disappointment was the attitude of staff on reception. With only one exception (Mohammed) they were completely lacking in courtesy and very, very unhelpful. There was no offering of information about the surrounding area, no map offered, no information about the hotel - not even the time of breakfast - and the person on checkout was just plain rude. I was both surprised and disappointed - my experience of other hotels in the US is exactly the opposite and this is supposedly one of New York's best hotels.
Management ought seriously to consider sending reception staff on a course in customer service, or even common courtesy - and on supervising them properly. The pluses of the hotel do not make up for their appalling attitude. I would not choose to stay here in the future for that reason.",Cath A,2012-04-01,122005,2012-05-04,False,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Not a hotel for a business trip” I've been booked in here by my business travel implant at $200 per night and it is not good value. The room is tiny, tatty and very dated.

Wifi drops out more than it is on and the desk have no international plug adapters to lend out, even with a deposit. The security is questionable. Anyone can walk straight off the street up to the upper floors. A security guard is in the lobby but has not questioned anyone approaching the lifts and given that the first 10 floors are student and rented accommodation it doesn't feel like a hotel.

Our standard room was VERY small, but we were expecting this, and to be honest didn't spend hardly any time in it. The bathroom fittings were pretty old, and the room could do with updating, but we were happy because it was such a good price.

"“Excellent location and clean rooms” This was our 1st visit to the Big Apple and we chose this hotel firstly because it was in a good location (Penn Station, Empire State, Macy's nearby) but also because we wanted our hotel to look New Yorkish! And it didn't disappoint. Our room looked out towards the East River, and the view looked good both day and night. We had mentioned before travelling that we were celebrating 60th & 40th birthdays and were given a tiny gold box of 2 chocolates with a picture of the hotel on the front, which was a nice gesture.The room was small (how long do you spend in a NY hotel room when there is so much to see?) but very clean, and the beds were soo comfortable. We asked for tea and coffee making facilities in the room, so we could have our morning cuppa, and we also asked for a fridge too so we could have ""proper"" milk. The supermarket Duane Read was just across the road for that.The staff were very pleasant and helpful and the concierge desk gave us info on absolutely everything we asked them. The gift shop in the basement was extremely good value for money if you needed to buy souvenirs, and the Tick Tock diner - accessible through the Hotel lobby - was atmospheric if a little on the pricey side.

"“Best hotel in New York!” Hotel could not have had a better location. The Empire State Building was less than 10 minutes away and we could see it in all its glory from our hotel windown, Madison Square Garden is also next to the hotel - main subway station across the road, everything in midtown and upper Manhattan within walking distance - Times Square, Central Park, 5th Avenue, Grand Central, Rockefeller Centre. You can catch the subway across the road to the 9/11 Memorial which is about 10 minutes away by subway. The Brooklyn Bridge and Staten Island Ferry are also in downtown Manhattan so you can get a subway directly to these as well. The hotel was really great - friendly staff, clean, excellent lifts (which helps a lot because the hotel is about 44 floors high and we were on the 35th floor!). Maceys is also nearby with enough other shops to keep any shopaholic in heaven! The Tick Tock Diner attached to the hotel is great too - although we did find other diners in the area for breakfast after the first day. There are so many places to eat (with huge portions!) you will be spoilt for choice. The hotel could not be better placed. Some people said their rooms were too small but we did not find this - we travelled with our teenage sons and shared a room and it was fine. After all, you will be so busy that it is just a place to shower and sleep. The beds are soooo comfortable and you will have the best nights sleep ever with all the walking and exploring you will be doing!

"“Art Deco Elegance, Comfort, and Perfect Proximity for Train travelers” I don't usually care for bigger hotels, but the proximity to Penn Station/subway, government rate, and Art Deco elegance made up for it. Entrance to Penn Station is right across the street, and you really feel like you're in New York here. Beautiful lobby, nicely restored. Front desk is a little brisk, but that's to be expected in a large, busy hotel. Despite a lot of others arriving when we did, check-in was quick and painless, no trouble with our government rate either. 
Our room (29th floor) was exactly what I asked for. Not large, but we had a corner room with two exposures, so it didn't feel cramped, and we could bring in fresh air. Nice view overlooking 8th Avenue. Full-size, two sided closet was nice for two travelers. Iron/ironing board, and luggage stand were handy. Bathrooms are not large, but ours had a window! and was well equipped. Plenty of hot water. Comfortable beds. separate chair and desk were included. 
Furnishings are quite nice, authentic art-deco reproductions made the room feel elegant, as are the elevator lobbies. Someone has put a lot of tthought and work into to maintaining the character of the hotel, and it shows. Nick and Nora Charles would be at home here! Art deco enthusiasts (and even purists) will approve. 
We didn't make it to Cooper's Tavern, but it looked like a nice spot for a drink, burger, etc. 
Our rate included a substantial continental breakfast Friday, at a 39th floor lounge with terrific views. Saturday included full breakfast at the Tick Tock diner. Large and busy, but service was quick/friendly, and food was very good. Get there early before lines get too long! 
Concierge desk was accomodating, and helped us locate Birdland. We checked our luggage before a 2 PM train, bell staff were friendly, took good care of my suitcases, and we had no delays. 
Overall, we had a nice experience, and would easily stay here again. If you dislike bland, chain hotels, and want a little elegant NY feel to where you stay, this is a great place.

The room (on the 24th floor) although clean, was very small with no where to sit other than on one chair or the bed.

From that moment on the whole scenario changed, For another $US40 a night we were upgraded to a room on the 39th floor that had a small separate lounge, a bar fridge, coffee making machine, and included a very substantial continental breakfast. The staff were wonderful and it really made our stay. Coopers Tavern adjacent to the hotel has a great ""Happy Hours"" menu. Entree sized portions for about $5 and drinks similar.

“Excellent :)” Stayed at The New Yorker for a week in March and I really can't fault it. From the moment we arrived we received excellent service. We were checked in immediately even though we arrived 2 hours before check in opened and the room we received was lovely. I have stayed in various hotels in NYC this was by far the best. The room was big for New York standards and had a view to die for. We had a great view of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Location could not have been better for tourist attractions and transport links with Penn station being on the door step. Tick Tock dinner also very good for tasty food at low prices.

"“Expensive, small - but convenient!” This was our first trip to NYC. The hotel is a beautiful structure inside and out. When you walk in, it is like taking a time machine.
Looks are one thing, but comfort is another...
The rooms are VERY small. I know that real estate in this area comes at a high price, but these rooms were incredibly small. The beds are hard - this is ok for me, but my wife had a difficult time sleeping.
Another issue that we ran into was that the hot water was not working one night during our stay. The issue impacted the entire hotel, so they were unable to do anything about it. This is not something that I would expect when I am paying close to $300 a night.
The best thing about this hotel is the location. Everything you could possibly need is within walking distance. It is a prime location for this very busy area of New York. The Tick Tock Diner is also attached to this hotel - great place to eat any time of the day.
Overall, I was somewhat upset with our decision to stay here. I just don't feel like I got my money's worth. Don't get me wrong - it is a very historic hotel and they have done a decent job updating everything. We had a great view of the Hudson and the location was wonderful, but I just felt like it should have been 'nicer' for the price.

"“Great Hotel in a Central Location” We booked through our local travel agent and although we had been there in 1998 there had been a huge renovation programme a couple of years ago. The rooms were modern and clean. The double bed was very comfortable. There was a flat panel TV with a variety of free and pay TV channels. Each room had an ironing board and iron, telephone with internal, external and room to room dialling. The bathroom was clean and functional with plenty of towels. The shower was excellent, and the shower curtain went round in a curve to stop flooding (my biggest bathroom gripe in hotels in general.) The bath was the same depth on the outside as it was in the inside so there would be no need to step up or step down when getting in and out. The only downside with the bathroom was the shelf in front of the mirror was not very wide and there was no other storage space. The hotel provided soap (body and face), shower gel, shampoo, condition, and body moisturiser and replaced before they were empty.
Outside in the public areas the corridors were clean and tidy at all times. Each floor had a vending machine for drinks and an ice machine. There were 12 lifts (six going from floors 1-20 and six going from floors 20-40). In the lobby there was a check-in desk were there were always three or four very pleasant and helpful staff, and luggage storage facility with a $1 per item storage charge (half on leaving your bag and half on collecting - didn't quite understand this idea but....), a valet parking desk, general information desk, a quick snack counter (pain au chocolat to die for) and a theatre ticket booking desk. The security was great with no access to the lifts without showing you key card to the security staff. There was plenty of seating in the foyer. There were bank style safety deposit boxes in reception with 24 hour access. The staff needed to use their key after the guest had signed the register, as well as the guest key and it was in a private room. The boxes were only suitable for money, credit cards, and passports as they were long and narrow. There is a business centre with three PC's with chargeable internet access although logging in to airline websites to check in was free as was printing your boarding passes. There was also a gym. There is wi-fi access in the room, there is a charge for the fast access but there is a slower (much slower) free network - but it is free.
The bar and restaurant is Coopers. Food was good but very large portions, with a wide choice of wines, beers, spirits and cocktails. The Tick-Tock Diner is on the corner of the hotel on 8th and 34th St. It is open 24 hours and seats about 350 people. The service was quick and friendly and the portions catered for the ""American"" appetite. We only ate breakfast there but it was adequate until dinner.
The hotel is situated on the corner of 8th Ave and 34th St. Three blocks from the Empire State Building, 2 blocks from Macy's Department store and one block from Madison Square Garden. Penn Station is also diagonally across the street with it's access to the Subway system and the LIRR train services to Jamaica Station (for JFK airport) and New Jersey Transit (for Newark). Lots of bars and restaurants are within a couple of blocks of the hotel, and a cinema across the street.

"“Overpriced For The Average Couple/Family” The hotel is ideally placed if you want to be in the centre of things; which is a double-edged sword. Good if you have a few days to spend and want to see the majority of the tourist attractions or near transit links to see them. However, for that same reason, all the bars etc are very expensive for many blocks around. The average beer price is between $5 - £9, even more expensive than the UK by some margin. Food, except junk food, is also every overpriced, likewise in the hotel bar/restaurant. Presumably due to the historic status of the hotel, the windows are on the thin side and obviously no double glazing or noise abatement. Therefore, it is fairly noisy, unless you are quite high up.
It has a nice entrance. Unfortunetly, interesting architecture does not make a great hotel. Although the bag handlers and security were pleasant and helpful, the staff behind the counter in reception were fairly unsmiling and officious with that false politeness and brusqueness that the service sector is famous for in America; especially in NYC. My girlfriend was in floods of tears within 10 minutes fo arrival, partly due to rudeness and also a mix up with then hotel that may or may not have been the hotels fault. The duty Manager, in the end, when she dropped the aforesaid atttitude and actually started smiling and acting like a real person - treating us like people/customers - tried her best to sort out the situation, which was done a few days later. To me, this should be the default attitude of all staff, not something you eventually get to when staff drop that defensiveness that they have. To be fair, this was attitude we experienced throughout the city...Small towns in PA & NJ were a welcome relief from this......
The room was was clean and the cleaners did a good job. The view was good too. However, it was an odd shape and fairly uninspiring and I have stayed in bigger/more personal/welcoming three-star hotels and B & Bs throughout the UK. On this basis and having seen the bill, I would say the rooms were quite over-priced, if not very overpriced. The room was not four-star by any stretch of the imagination. There is better value, but more welcoming hotel rooms/B & Bs to be had in NYC. For example, in the second half of the weekend we rented a welcoming, airy and warm appartment in the suburbs via AirB&B. If you want your own space and better value - especially if you are a couple or small family/group of friends, I would recomend doing this instead. In essence, this is a three-star hotel pretending to be a four-star hotel, seemingly because of the architecture/lobby",Doug S,2012-03-01,122005,2012-04-23,False,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Macys is very close by, Times Square is just around the corner and we managed to walk to Central Park, 5th Avenue and Grand Central from the hotel. The only time we used the subway was to get to the ferry to stattan island, it gives you fabulous views of Liberty, and its free!
Some of the Reception staff are a little bit rude but don't let that put you off.

"“There are better hotels for the money in New York” I've been to New York a few times and whilst there isn't anything wrong with this hotel, there are better options out there and I wouldn't stay here again.
It's location is good for getting to the subway, Penn station is just one block away, but it's on a really busy corner of 8th avenue. Not the nicest part of the city and I wouldn't have felt safe walking along the road to it on my own at night.
The hotel itself was clean. The room was tiny - by far the smallest I have experienced (and it's by no means the cheapest hotel I have stayed in). The hotel generally is tired looking and could really do with some revamp. It could be lovely.
The lifts are a real problem in this hotel. With so many floors, a huge number of rooms and only 5 lifts going above the 21st floor we regularly were waiting for 15-20 minutes for a lift to stop at the floor, with space for us to get in.
The staff were average. No one went out of their way particularly, but they were ok. I was a bit annoyed that they charged me to store my case for 30 minutes while I went and picked up my hire car... that kind of sums up this hotel.

The tiny bathroom also was clean, warm water was plenty, the fixtures ancient, slow warm-water drip. The next room's flush toilets sounded as if they were in my bathroom. Keep the bathroom door shut.

"“PERFECT Hotel for a Large Family!” Absolutely the best hotel we've stayed in as a family of six! Finding affordable accommodations in NYC for us and our four children (two young children and two teenage boys) is a real task. If you have more than two children, then you know how hard it is to try and book a NYC hotel online (many online forms only allow for up to two children). We booked a suite at The New Yorker, and we were AMAZED at how spacious and wonderful our room was! The hotel receptionist was VERY gracious and helpful! She ordered a rollaway cot for our room so each teenager had their own bed in the livingroom of the suite (one teen had the sofa bed, the other teen used the rollaway). When the rollaway arrived, along with it came more towels and a bag filled with more shampoos/etc, as the receptionist realized we could probably use them with all of our kids. The rooms were spotless, beds very comfortable, the table and chairs were a BIG plus, we loved having a refridgerator, two TVs... and the HUGE surprise was finding we had a corner room with TWO fabulous views of the city! The area of the hotel is perfect for walking to Broadway, Times Square, Penn Station (where we took the subway to Battery Park), Empire State Building and more. Parking garage next door even accommodated our large SUV for the duration of our stay. Staff were all very friendly, and we will most definitely book here again on our next family trip!

"“Small room, but great location. No frills.” Good points:
- Good location
- Pay a bit extra and get a room with a view of the Empire State (well worth it)
- Next to the excellent Tick Tock Diner (although a bit pricey)
- Lifts quite quick
- Bedrooms nicely decorated
Bad points:
- Tiny room (kind of to be expected because of the location)
- No in room coffee maker/kettle
- No in room fridge
- No in room safe. Safes available for use down in reception, however, there can sometimes be a queue of 20 people waiting to check in, so you have to wait in the same line. Extremely inconvenient when you just want to grab a bit more cash before you head out. To be fair, the staff at reception did warn us this might happen, but you're left with little choice when you want to protect your valuables. Only 10 safes big enough for laptops, and once they're gone, they're gone, and it's a big hotel so I expect it can happen often.
- Shower had an energy saving head which made it feel like you were washing under a haze of water rather than a proper shower. Tried to have a bath instead but the overflow hole was so far down the bath that the water would drain out too low down and leave only about 8 inches of water in the bath.

"“Good Hotel for the first NY-visit” We planned our first visit of NYC in november 11 and also booked a deluxe room in the New Yorker Hotel. About a week before departure we changed our mind and asked for an upgrade to one of their tower suites. After 4 days of waiting for a response, we got an upgrade offer for 75$ per night... pretty cheap if you compare it to the standard tower suite price. 
As we heard about their slightly unfriendly personal we didn´t expect much of the check in. 
Unfortunatly their was no upgrade noted in our file, so we had to discuss with the receptionist to get the upgrade for the promised 75$. It seemed that they had mistakenly told us the price of 75$ and now wanted to withdraw their error. But after 20min of talking we managed to get our upgrade.
Room was - for a suite - not too big, but for 4 days and 3 persones it´s ok. Minibar was free, but there was only 1 Coke, 1 Dietcoke and 1 water in it. We had a coffeemachine and 2 big flatscreens for each room. Beds were exeptionally good. View was also superb, as we could directly see the Empire State building from our beds. Windows were able to open for about 10 centimeters. Unfortunatly there were 2 balconys of the other suites directly unter our windows. The first 2 nights we were lucky as nobody used it, but in the third night some spanish or mexican people thought it would be a good idea to invite all their friends to have a nice party on the balcony. Unfortunatly the doors were also very loud an had a large slit so you heard everyone coming and going to the lifts. Bathroom was a bit too small and very hot. The shower was a desaster as you felt like in jail while under it. There didn´t even flow enough water to get the shampoo of your body. By the way, room was nearly top-floor (39 of 40). So liftrides at rush hour took more then 10 min. 
The complementary breakfast was a joke (at least for us). Cerials, joghurt and some dry buns, muffins and crossains. Coffee was typicly american, tasted after chlorine and to feel the coffeine you had to drink about 20 cups. We went to TikTokDiner the next days.
Checkout was efficient as you just have to drop you keys in a box if your bill is ok.

"“Great Location - Exactly What We Hoped For In A Hotel” If you are looking for a luxurious setting or rooms, not really the place for you. However, if you are looking for a centrally located ""decent"" hotel, with friendly staff, this is definitely the place.
Located 1 block away from Penn. Station (and therefore super convenient if arriving by train), this hotel is a fairly easy walk away from Central Park (1 mile north), the High Line Elevated Park (1/2 mile to the West), or Chelsea (1 mile south), as well as many other locations.
We were slightly dismayed on arrival, because: (a) the check-in line was a bit lengthy; and (b) the main elevators weren't working. However, we were upgraded (to a balcony room) just by asking nicely (balcony = absolutely worth it, even if paying!). And, the hotel staff worked very hard to direct folks to service elevators (this was only temporary and the problem was fixed within 1 hour) and were very polite and extremely apologetic about the (slight) inconvenience.
Rooms were a bit on the small side, but were always promptly cleaned and furnished with new towels.
While not really the highlight of the trip (hotel really isn't the point of visiting NYC, is it?), it was the perfect background for the trip. That is, we never experienced any really problems with the hotel, so we were free to enjoy our weekend.

"“Third time in NYC, best hotel visited!!!” My wife and I stayed at The New Yorker for 4 nights over Easter in 2012. This was our 3rd visit to the Big Apple and we decided to stay a little further out than tourist time square and stumbled on The New Yorker on expedia. 
From the moment we checked in, we new this was the best overall hotel we have had in New York to date! 
The Lobby is splendid and the staff helpful so we settled straight into our holiday. Our room was a Metro Queen(2183) and although we didn't have a view of the Empire state, we got to watch sunrise and sunset over The Hudson and New Jersey, which isn't bad.
The room was easily large enough for us, with a closet, drawer space and a large comfy bed. The only issues were a little bit if poor wiring and a shower with difficult temperature to regulate. If these are your only issues though, I certainly deem this as a good hotel.
The excellent Tick Tock Diner (see seperate review) and Coopers Tavern, both accessed from the lobby are excellent and reasonable value making life easier, especially for breakfast, or a quick drink after a long days sightseeing!
All in all, I was delighted we ventured away from Time Square and certainly believe you get far better value for money. I would definitely recommend The New Yorker hotel and will use again next time we are in New York!!!

It not only had 2 beds but also a small 'lounge' area with a separate tv and settee. The bathroom was great and cleanliness was excellent. Only thing we had to ask for was a coffee machine which is not automatically provided but perhaps tea/coffee making facilities are just a british thing in hotels!

"“A fab hotel!” This hotel really is ideal if you visit New York as it is central to the main sites, from the window we could see the Empire State, Madison Square Gardens & Chrysler Building which were all a very short walk from the hotel. The staff were very helpful, the diner attached to the hotel served very good food and again very helpful staff. The hotel is art deco so interior is gorgeous. The only negative I would say was that there was no facilities for making coffee/tea in the room which may just be how it is in America but us Europeans do like our tea especially first thing in the morning!

"“Fantastic location and excellent service” Just returned from spending a girls only Easter in the New Yorker hotel. What a fantastic hotel . From the moment we walked in we were impressed .The hotel has a fab art deco style . All 6 of us shared 3 double rooms , which consisted of 2 double beds (large enough and very clean and comfy). Each room had a tv, iron and ironing board and bath/shower and hair dryer (bring your own dryer though). plenty of storage for your suitcases etc.
Once settled in you can then go and explore New york and from this hotel you are never far from anywhere.We were on the 29th floor so noise was not an issue at all. The views of New york were Amazing. I was lucky enough to have a spectacular view of The Empire State Building.....simply Stunning!!
There is a superb Diner attached to the hotel and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful , the food was perfect and plentiful and was very inexpensive.
This was an all over fantastic experience
The hotel staff were a credit to The New Yorker hotel and We as a group look forward to returning and staying here again!",Elaine M,2012-04-01,122005,2012-04-12,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“A good place to stay” Have just returned from spending three nights in this hotel. We had upgraded to a room with a view (35th floor) and we were not disappointed. the view of ESB was superb. Beds were very comfortable. Room was spacious and bathroom was fine. No complaints at all . The location for many tourist attractions was excellent.

"“excellent stay at the new yorker hotel downtown new york city” Every person working at this hotel is excellent. Any one I stopped with a question, answered it or sent me to the correct person to answer my question. I was my first time to the city with my daughter and I had many questions, so this alone was a great help. All the staff is friendly and will go out of their way for you, what ever you need. The Hotel was very clean and quite beautiful. Also the location is great, right by Penn station where we came in from , and across the street one of the main subway steams to get you to where ever you want to go. I definiately will stay again next year when I will be in the city for the same event. I can't say enough good things about this hotel and it's employees. Also the diner is great and is open 24 hours- great service and food and very clean. thank you New Yorker Hotel for making my stay in the city a great experience.",cheryl f,2012-03-01,122005,2012-04-12,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Ok hotel in a good location” We stayed at The New Yorker for three nights, our room on the 24th floor was small and did not have a lot of storage space, consequently we didn't unpack for the whole of our stay! However the bed was comfy and the bathroom, albeit a little dated, but had a nice deep bathtub and we had no problems with getting hot water. The room was clean, but had no tea or coffee making facilities. There was also only two plug sockets in the room which had the table lamp and tv plugged into it. 
The Tick Tock diner was great for breakfast, we also had a drink in the bar attached to the hotel, I can recommend the Long Island Iced Tea cocktail!.
Safety deposit boxes are kept in the room next to the reception desk and staff had to let you in to access them which was a bit of a nuisance if you were in a rush and the reception desk was busy...
The hotel location is good and is close to Penn Station, 42nd Street and Times Square. Madison Square Gardens is virtually opposite and Macy's is a short walk.",TDWKent,2012-04-01,122005,2012-04-10,True,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Good for what you pay for” My boyfriend and I spent 5 nights in New York staying at the New Yorker in March, in a renovated Queen Room. We were looking for a hotel in a good location for a decent price, that we would not be spending much time in, and that's what we got. 
Opposite Penn Station, so super convenient for transfers to/from Newark/JFK. 
The room at first seemed a bit small, but had a decent sized wardrobe so was fine. 
The room was super clean, housekeeping were fantastic.
A great location, perfect for tourist spots such as Empire State Building, Macy's, and Time's Square.
Incredibly confortable beds, and very quiet, especially considering it's the middle of New York!
But.. The shower was terrible! It kept fluctuating between extremely hot and cold, was rather annoying! The bathroom generally was in need of an upgrade.
No safe in the room. Could be a pain during busy periods when trying to access the safe at reception.
The staff could have been happier... (except housekeeping, they were lovely) 
The view from our window was of the tower block opposite, But when we were there to spend our time up other tower blocks we didn't care!
Basically, if you get a good deal, and are looking for a decent, clean base to explore New York, this is the place.",K_Mizzle,2012-03-01,122005,2012-04-09,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“A comfortable Place to Stay” This hotel is nice, clean and in a good location for Penn station, Macys, The Empire State and Madison Square Gardens. 
Initially we had a pokey room on the 23rd floor with a poor view, however after a night a noise from a neighbour (the walls seem very thin), we complained and were eventually moved to a room on the 33rd floor with fantastic views of the Hudson River. The higher the floor the better the view! 
The Ticktock diner attached was perfect for convenient breakfasts and snacks, highly recommended. 
If I visited NY again, which I intend to do, I would stop closer to Times Square. But this hotel was a great first time hotel.
One note,a lot of the staff on reception are very rude and clearly are not bothered that you have paid a large amount to stop at this hotel. Customer service at the desk was sometimes no existant. However we found the staff on the information desk to be much more helpful and were very friendly, they certainly made up for the other staff.",cRuZ31,2012-03-01,122005,2012-04-08,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Exceeded expectations” I booked ahead and got a 25% discount deal on the hotel website for 6 nights. The thing I liked was that it was still fully cancellable up to 24hrs before. We are a family of 3, 2 adults one small child. We got a tower suite on the 38th floor. The room was enormous. 2 bathrooms, large living room with sofa bed, coffee making facilities, dining-conference table, a balcony with two outdoor tables under the NEW YORKER neon sign. First of all, the location was perfect. Subway ACE just next to the entrance and then a block away from 1 and 2 and Penn St. We took the LIRR and air train to and from the hotel and it took less than an hour both ways. Around the hotel were plenty of shops, eateries etc and 8 blocks to Times Sq.
Upon check in the front desk was acting a little strange about giving us a room before 3pm as we arrived at 2.40pm. It seemed like they were fishing for a tip and also trying to talk us into paying more to get a room with an premium view. Just be weary of that. On average we were already paying high 300s per night, so were a bit put off by the front desk staff.
The room was very quiet being up high and we slept well. The deal included continental breakfast on the 39th floor so you get to enjoy the breathtaking view of empire state bldg, chrysler bldg, MSG etc if your room is facing another direction. The spread is pretty decent and the staff member is very helpful and a pleasure to deal with.
The Wifi worked ok in the room, sometimes it was hard to log in due to heavy traffic.
The hot water was OK too, sometimes it is not that hot during peak hours.
If you are planning to bring food back to the room, it´s not ideal as there is no microwave or cutlery. We were not used to the American serving sizes and always over ordered. If the hotel had a complete mini kitchenette it would have been more convenient.
Being in a tower suite, gives you access to the business centre in the basement. You need to use your credit card to get online and it was really handy to print out prepaid tickets to various NY attractions which give you discounts if you buy your pass online..ie. Bronx Zoo, NYBG etc.
We ate at the Tick Tock Diner for lunch on the first day and the food is not good. Stale salad, refried chips, frozen precooked chicken etc. Breakfast is not too bad though.
It´s interesting to note, that similar to what other guests have written, I am missing a pair of new dress socks that I bought as a present for my niece. It was not an expensive item but it´s still missing.
I would recommend this hotel for its location and particularly staying on the higher floors. Having said this, there are plenty of choice in NYC so unless I got a super deal I would not stay here again.",pspf,2012-04-01,122005,2012-04-07,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Very. Noisy and small rooms.” This hotel is very old even though It claims to be renovated. In my experience the rooms were very small and noisy. I experienced lots of road noise as well as noise from adjacent rooms. This led to poor sleep. The walls are very thin I could hear people showering in adjacent rooms or even watching tv plus there was lots of noise just from opening and closing doors. In the shower setting a consistent water temperate is impossible. It's either too hot or too cold and changes constantly. 
Location is fine for day sight seeing just do not go out alone late at night. It does not feel like that safe of a neighborhood after dark.",TX_Flyer001,2012-04-01,122005,2012-04-07,True,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.6,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Home from Home” Stayed in this hotel for five nights in November 2011 only getting to write review now. This was a holiday for my husbands birthday so I spent a lot of time reading reviews of hotels. We picked this hotel because of location and price.We were were very happy with everything about the hotel. I requested a room with a good view and got a lovely room and bathroom. It was however the staff and Tick tock diner that made it home frome home. i would also like to sincerely thank the two ladies on the concierge desk who booked our tickets and gave us lots of advise and information.

"“Excellent Practical Base For Visiting NY” We stayed in the New Yorker hotel for 21 - 28 March 2012. Our choice was made on price and location. The New Yorker is ideally located across the road from Penn Station. My wife K and I were flying to Newark Airport then travelling into Manhattan by train so this hotel was ideally located. It is also 5 mins walk from Macy's, 10 min walk from ESB and 15 min walk from Times Square. Penn station provides you with easy access (via subway) for all the other locations. I have previously travelled to Vegas, SF, Orlando and all over Europe and when comparing the New Yorker to other hotels - the best description is practical and pleasant. It is not luxurious, there is nothing fancy and the rooms are not the size of a football pitch. However, it is clean the rooms are small but pleasant, some of the room views are amazing (ours was on the 37th floor with a view of the Hudson), for transport the location is perfect, the staff were friendly and although the reception was always busy, I never had to wait for more than 5 mins. An added bonus was the Tick-Tock diner, which is connected to the hotel - perfect for a good hearty breakfast to start the day. I highly recommend this hotel for those who want to spend the day out seeing the city and want a good practical base. If you want to spend lots of time in your room, then this hotel is not for you.",plod1127,2012-03-01,122005,2012-04-07,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“best hotel we have stayed in fab place” my husband and i stayed here for 5 nights in march 2012, we changed to this hotel as the reviews were good, and we were not dissapointed! fab room we payed the extra charge of $10 per night for a room with a view of the empire state building the room we stayed in was 3112 , the beds were super comfy, the room was gorgeous well decorated and very clean, the bathroom was large and also very clean, we had 3 large windows in our room, with views of the empire state building, madisson square gardens and also the hudson river could be seen in the distance, if i had to be really picky and moan about anything it would have to be the shower in our bathroom, which ran quite slow and was either freezing cold or boiling hot, but we got by once we got it set to a temp .. but come on you cant let that small thing ruin this beautiful hotel! 
the staff were very friendly and welcoming, we often would sit down stairs which had lots of seating areas and watch the world go by, the security on site was excellent, always checking that people who were coming in where actually staying there all day and night, which i found to be a good idea and felt very safe...
the lifts were great, never waited for one, and they were quite fast, we took our laptop with us and used the free wireless which was good very fast had no problems.
the tick tock diner inside the hotel did lovely food, we ate there a few times, and very polite staff and good value for money alot cheaper than some places. 
this hotel was in a great location, close to everything, me and my husband walked everywhere, subway close by, close to macys, 5-10 min walk to times square... 
i would 100% stay here again i wouldnt book anywhere else as this was our second trip to nyc, and we were very happy with this hotel, it was very cold when we were there and spent a couple of evenings in the hotel which we didnt mind as it was a lovely place to be ...

"“A fantastic stay in NYC!” Just returned from a 7 night stay at the New Yorker. Had a great time. We had a view room which certainly lived up to its name, We had the most amazing view of the Empire State Buidling. Really it was more than we could have dreamt of on our first trip to the city. The room was plenty big enough for the 2 of us. The bathroom was quite large with a nice deep tub. Yes, the tile paint was chipped in places but to be honest we didn't spend enough time in there to stress over it. Everything was really clean. Every member of staff we dealt with was really helpful. I do recommend the car service to and from JFK. This was well worth it and the complimentary printing of the booking pass was an added bonus. Now that we have found the New Yorker we wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else! Also recommend the Tick Tock diner and the guy with the counter in the lobby selling coffee/tea and pastries etc - a great alternative to a full cooked breakfast in the diner.",Vroona,2012-04-01,122005,2012-04-04,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Not to mention the location is very close to Times Square and Penn Station.

"“Great Location” We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the New Yorker, the hotel is a perfect location for getting around NYC. The front desk are helpful and polite, it is definetly worth taking a safety deposit box out, as there are no safes in the room. If you can upgrade to a view room, the room we had looked straight at the Empire State and Chrysler building. The rooms are small and the bathroom quite dated but very clean. This hotel is a 10-15 minute walk from Times Square, a 5 minute walk to Macy's and 10 minutes to the Empire state. Take a walk to Uncle Jack's steak house which is located on 9th behind the hotel. The steaks are the best. I would give Tick Tock Diner a big swerve and opt for Coopers Tavern on the other side of the hotel. If you feel like experiencing a real New York bar, walk down to the Blarney Stone just past the post office on the opposite side of the street, its happy hour all day!

"“Brilliant hotel in a perfect location to explore the city!” The New Yorker is perfect if you want a hotel thats central and close to everything! For starters, we flew into JFK airport and got a taxi to the hotel which is a flat rate of $50 + any tip you decide to give. We was on the 31st floor (thank god for lifts!) The room on first impression was small, but was clean, very modern and comfortable. The bed was also very comfortable. Considering it is the city that never sleeps, we didnt hear much noise outside, even with the window open. You can however hear sirens, and there you will hear a few whilst your there! The maids were very friendly and always smiling!! In terms of food, there is a diner attached to the hotel called the Tick Tock diner. We always ate breakfast there. Good choice at reasonable prices. Sometimes the staff were rude but think this was due to stress because of how busy it used to get. New York as a city is fantastic. The hotel is literally next to Madison Square Gardens, less than 5 minutes to Macys and less than 10 minutes to Empire State building. It is also about a 10 minute walk to Times Square. We went to see Mary Poppins and Sister Act musicals, both were fantastic! Just a bit of advice on attractions. The Hop On Hop Off bus tickets are fantastic. We used the Red Buses (Gray Line). If visiting Statue of Liberty, go early as the queues are sooooo long!! We visited Empire State building in the day, and Top of the Rockerfeller at night - both fantastic!!

"“Home base for a dream vacation” We booked our New York vacation through Air MIles and after considering a couple of options decided on The New Yorker. We were not disappointed. This is a great hotel with small but comfortable rooms and great security. For $10 a night we upgraded to a room-with-a-view and it was worth every penny. We were in a corner room and out of one window had a view of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State building a few blocks away and Penn Station and Madison Square Garden just below. Out of the other window we had a partial view of the Hudson River and all the buildings north of the hotel. It seems like a small thing but there's something magical about being able to look out over the city at night. The lighting on the Empire State Building changes from time to time. It was green for St. Patrick's Day. The great thing about The New Yorker is that its within walking distance of many local attractions - Times Square, Broadway, St. Patrick's Cathedral, The Rockefeller Centre, MoMA, 5th Avenue. If you're ambitious you can even walk to the 9-11 Memorial (about 2 miles) and Central Park. There are many excellent restaurants in the area and it's an easy walk to local favourites like Grimaldi Pizza and Brooklyn Bagels. The Chinese restaurant just a block away, Chef Yu, was excellent. For a great lunch take the subway down to 369 Broome Street for a sub sandwich at Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich. One of the best meals all week was the Thai dinner we ate at Bangkok House, 360 West 46th, just a healthy walk from the hotel. The bed in our room was extremely comfortable and after walking miles every day we slept well. The housekeeping service was good - almost too good - as sheets and towels were changed even when they didn't need to be. The smallness of the room wasn't a factor most of the time, but the absence of a second chair meant that one of us had to sit on the bed while watching television (rare) or using the hotel's free internet. The free internet tended to be a little slow but we decided against the upgrade to premium internet for around $10 per day. The souvenir shop in the basement of the hotel was well stocked and reasonably priced. If you're considering taking a double-decker bus tour the consensus seemed to be that the Gray Line is more reliable than the City Sights competitor. We had pre-booked with City Sights and overall it was pretty good. However, one afternoon on the Uptown Tour, we hopped off at the Metropolitan Museum and never did hop back on. Every bus that came by was full with others who had hopped back on. There were about ten very tired and frustrated people still waiting when we decided to take a cab back to our hotel. Anyway, it was a fabulous week and having a great, comfortable hotel like The New Yorker as our home base had a lot to do with making this the vacation of a lifetime.",Colin52,2012-03-01,122005,2012-04-01,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Very Rude Front Desk Staff” We stayed in the New Yorker for 7 nights for a vacation in March. I will start with the positives - the location of the hotel is good being just a few blocks from Macy's and the Empire State building. It is also next to Penn station so convenient for getting the Skytrain to JFK. The Tick Tock diner and Coopers Tavern restaurant we're both excellent with good food and friendly staff. I also couldn't complain about the maid service - staff were friendly and the room was always thoroughly cleaned.
Unfortunately, the negatives of the hotel far outweigh the positives. Upon check-in we had our first of many bad experiences with the front desk staff. We were ignored for several minutes despite several staff appearing to be free. Once we were served we not made to feel welcome, we're not given any information about the hotel or the local area (eg where to find the elevators, the hotel safe service, the buisness centre) and we're not offered help with our bags. During our stay we were shocked at how rude and unhelpful the reception staff were. We noticed other guests getting treated the same and also commenting on how rude the staff were so this does not appear to be a one off. In regards to the room it was adequate but as others have stated it is fairly small.
Overall I would not stay at this hotel again due to the bad experiences that we had with front desk staff.",nebsta1,2012-03-01,122005,2012-04-01,False,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

But quite pricey (we used most nights due to the ease of popping downstairs after long days of walking) an irish breakfast is $13.95 !

When I arrived there was a small mistake with my room - it had not been made up so I was given another room and a free breakfast in the restaurant downstairs - which was completely unexpected.

"“Great location, nice room but very poor and rude staff” Stayed here for total of four nights and it was the third hotel out of four during our two week vacation. Seemed to take an age to get checked in by staff. Considering it was our honeymoon there was a acknowledgement with a free breakfast but it was passed to us in the form of a voucher and not with any sincerity whatsoever.
Approached the consig service for help with booking online for our free 9/11 memorial passes and found the guy to be incredibly rude and unhelpful. Basically he explained that he was there to sell services for the hotel and anything outside of that was not his job. He also pointed us to the internet service downstairs for which there was a charge and I strongly objected to given it was a five min job. 
We also has an issue with our advanced booking of our Greyhound journey north to Boston on our last evening, the staff didn't want to know despite all the other hotels having done this for us hassel free. The duty desk manager, seriously lacking good quality customer service levels then reluctantly gave us access to another PC to complete the booking.
Our breakfast service was nothing short of disgraceful, very rude staff, only saving grace was it was free but in truth I wouldn't have probably paid for it anyway.
On the positive the maid service was excellent and they were all very friendly and polite. The room was small but had all the kit you would require for a short stay.
The major selling point of this hotel is purely the location which is superb, located 2 mins from MSG, 5 mins from Times Square and 10mins from Empire State Building in the heart of midtown. Therefore all attractions are easily accessible for a sightseeing trip.

The room was slightly smaller than what I have had at other New York hotels, but perfectly adequate for the time spent in it - clean and tidy with a comfy bed. 
The diner attached to the hotel was ideal for breakfast each morning, the portions were big enough for two, great selection, and speedy service.

"“New Yorker Hotel Feb 2012” Even though I made a booking online it still took at least 20 minutes (after queuing for 1/2hour) to get checked in.
The location around the hotel although in vicinity of Javit centre (about 15 minutes brisk walk) was a bit rundown, but it is close to a big station so that is expected.
The hotel was really nice but in a foregone era, now it needs refurbishment and upgrades. 
Don't include breakfast in your rate it is horrible, fatty and in a Route 66 restaurant open 24hrs (not sure when the clean) everything was always sticky!
The rooms was really small, even though we took one with a view (you could see the river if you checked carefully) so we upgraded to a bigger one which is more expensive but really just looking into other buildings.
The hotel is impersonal, big and extremely busy. Everything is charged extra, the rooms are old but clean. The bathrooms is really old, still with shower curtains (sorry I hate those)! Showers are inside an extremely small bath and very slippery.
The toiletpaper is located behind the door, and once you sit on the toilet you cant close the door you have to get up since the bathroom is so small. 
Definitely not for families, 
Maybe for a business person, the wireless was also very slow but at least for free!

"“I Will Keep Coming Back” i am a native New Yorker, and although I no longer live in this marvelous city, I keep coming back year after year. I've tried many hotels over the years, and I've decided the best location for me, at the most reasonable price, for a decent, comfortable hotel room is the New Yorker. Located on Eight Avenue and 34th Street, it is a quick walk to Macy's, Lord and Taylor, Broadway, Penn Station, and subway lines to Century 21 and the World Trade Center. Numerous restaurants are nearby. Check in is always quick and courteous, if there are no lines. And when there are, i usually check in my luggage and then come back at three p.m.
The rooms are older, but spacious with a beautiful view of the city. The decor isn't beautiful, and I don't think they have room service or breakfast, but an all- hour cafeteria adjoining the hotel can always provide you with food at a most reasonable price.

"“Clean, comfortable hotel, perfect location - rude reception staff” I dont normally write reviews, however i felt the need to share my experience of this hotel with others. I'm quite fussy about where I sleep and this hotel was perfect for me. Clean rooms and comfortable beds. The rooms aren't massive but they aren't tiny either. We used the hotels newyorker rides to pick us up from the airport. The staff where so helpful, they replied to my 100 emails promptly and even called me to take the reservation over the phone as my card wasn't processing. Excellent customer service :) and the return fair was not expensive (cheaper than a taxi). We ate in the diner attached to the hotel the first night. Portion sizes are massive. Staff also very polite. My mums a bit of a tea genie and we asks house keeping for a kettle, they sent up a tea/ coffee machine, free of charge, which they replenished every day. The only negative I have is that the reception staff at the hotel are rude, abrupt and dismissive. We were checked in and checked ur by 2 different receptionist and they both had the same manner. It did not ruin our holiday, however it was bad enough that I feel the need to comment on it.

"“Convenient to Penn Station” I stayed at The New Yorker three nights and found that it is a very convenient hotel! There is a gift shop and a few restaurants within the hotel that we took advantage of on several occasions. Also, it is just a stone's throw from Penn Station which is a great convenience to not have to drag your luggage all over the city. The hotel is close to Madison Square Garden and the Empire State building also. But I will say if you're looking to stay in the swanky part of town, I would say keep looking. Being a petite girl, I wasn't frightened at night, just a tad uneasy . 
As far as the actual stay in the hotel is concerned, the staff were friendly, the bathrooms were clean, the maid service was nice and the room was an OK size by NY standards. I found the beds to be very comfortable, that's says a lot considering I have trouble sleeping almost every night. I was also pleased to find out that the windows opened a few inches to let in a breeze. We stayed on the 34th floor, we didn't actually pay for a view but we got a decent one of downtown which is a huge plus!! Good value for the money!
The only real complaint I had about this hotel was that the doors slam very loud, this can be alleviated with just holding the door as you shut it but most guests aren't that courteous. I woke up at least three times every night from our neighbors arriving and slamming the door shut. I would think the hotel gets complaints daily about this and they would install devices to make the door close slowly...

“In the heart of New YORK” Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights to celebrate husbands 50th. On arrival asked for room with view and recieved free upgrade to room on 28th floor as well as small box of chocolates for hubby. The room itself was small but clean and tidy.It had a flat screen TV and bathroom was well equipped. No tea and coffee making facilities which would have been nice but I guess there was no room. We had a view of the Empire States building. The walls were very thin and could hear others....It states 4* but in my view this is not 4*. It is a central hotel right next to the Subway and if you have never been to NY and want to see the sights then this is the hotel for you. Shops such as Macys and others right on your doorstep.The Tick Tock dinner was good BUT would recommend you order one item and share plenty for two. Check out was noon so that was good and place to store cases whilst you wait. Staff were helpful and stay was enjoyable.

Decent location, walking distance to Macy's and the Empire State building, and 10 minutes from Times Square. Rooms are small but clean. The hotel staff from the front desk to the cleaning staff were so helpful.

“Great Hotel” We choose the New Yorker since we were on a layover on our Amtrak cross country trip. We walked from Penn station to the hotel after arriving on the Amtrak Crescent and were greeted very warmy at the front desk. Our room was FANTASTIC...We were on the 31 floor in a corner room with a view of the Hudson river and New Yorks skyline. The room was very clean and up to date. The art deco interior was great. All services at the hotel were very good and diiner at the Tic Tock just was the perfect end to our day,snarkaz,2012-03-01,122005,2012-03-21,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Hotel staff were friendly at all times and very helpful.
We stayed in a Metro Queen room which is one of the more modern rooms. The room wasnt huge, but we fit both suitcases in the wardrobe so had more than enough room. We stayed in room 3507 which looks out onto 34th street and the Hodson River. The room was spotless upon arrival and was cleaned daily.

Our view of the Crysler Building and Empire State Building was beautiful, especially since one night there was a full moon. The room was clean and not as small of some of the NYC rooms. There were only two negatives: the towels were pretty small and thin which seemed strange because the bedding didn't seem as cheap and room next to ours had the door so close (maybe since they had a corner room?) so it sounded like someone was trying to open our door, when they were opening their door.

"“Comfy, easy to like” I really like New Yorker Hotel, being there couple of times and going again. Hotel is perfectly located regarding to shops, metrolines, attractions, restaurants etc. Hotel lobby is giving the international atmosphere in an American style and personnel has always been really nice. Room size can vary a lot, I guess depending where you are booking from. Last time the size was nice and we had a great view to Empire State building. Hotel has a Tick Tock diner where one can have nice breakfast in a traditional American way: eggs in many forms, milkshakes, burgers, pancakes. Diner is busy many times, so be prepared to wait a bit, especially in the morning. (But also, diner is open 24/7, if I remember right...)

"“Great location, very helpful attentive staff” My wife and I stayed here for a week, from 9th March to 16th March. This was our first visit to NYC, we had researched this hotel through Tripadvisor and from speaking with our friends. The hotel seems to be a popularly choice and it's understandable why. Firstly it's in a prime location and was central for us to all the places we wanted to see and go to. We arrived by subway, which is less than 100m from the hotel. 
I had booked this trip as part of my wife's birthday present and to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The best price was actually direct with the hotel, however given the economic climate I used a local travel agent.....another story!
On arrival we where allocated a basic room on the 32nd floor. The room was practical and clean, but small. Although we expected this as we were led to believe all hotel rooms in NYC are of similar size. 
A few days later we returned from a day of shopping to be upgraded to a suite on the 38th floor!
This room was spectacular, it had its own balcony! I have read reviews about its only a room, you won't be I. The room much but my advice would be if you can get a suite!
Other points about the hotel.
Hotel staff were friendly, helpful and attentive.
The attached dinner ""Tick Tock"" and bar/restaurant offer good meals and service. 
Rooms clean and practical, although no safes in either room we stayed.
Other reviews complained about time spent waiting on lifts, we had no problems. 
You can arrange a ""yellow"" cab taxi from the airport to the hotel, we didnt but priced it with staff who estimated it to be around $60, inclusive of tips and tolls. 
Would i recommend this hotel.....yes most definately!!!!!",Dave M,2012-03-01,122005,2012-03-19,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good Value and Location” We have stayed at the New Yorker Hotel twice when in NYC for a track meet. Each time we were very happy with our stay and would recommend it as a good value in an otherwise very expensive city. On both occasions, we found rooms for less than $175 a night. 
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and safe. There are security personnel stationed at the entrance to the elevators and you have to show your room keycard to access the elevators. The rooms are are on the small side, but that can be expected from a hotel that dates back to 1929. The spacious hotel lobby has been restored to its original art deco brilliance. This place has a lot of history to it, as it was once one of Manhatten's finest hotels in the 1930's and 1940's. The east side of the hotel faces down 34th Street with nice views of Madison Square Garden and the Empire State Building.
The midtown location makes the New Yorker an excellent home base for sightseeing. There are subway entrances on both sides of the hotel where you can catch the A, C and E trains for quick rides uptown or downtown. It is also close to The 1, 2, and 3 lines, which are a block away. The hotel is within easy walking distance of excellent restaurants, Times Square, Macy's and the theatre district. The hotel has a nice bar and restaurant and the popular Tick Tock diner. There are also cheap delis, fastfood joints and coffee-bagel places nearby. There is a Starbucks across the street and a Dunkin Donuts around the corner.
Checkout is around 11 am. If you have a later flight and would like to explore the city after checking out, you can store your bags at the Hotel for only $2. This is a very good value and we would not hesitate to return.",Todstours,2012-03-01,122005,2012-03-17,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“A great choice in NYC” We recently stayed at the New Yorker hotel. Even though the lobby is undergoing more renovations, the hotel already oozes charm from a past era while the rooms are as modern and comfortable as anywhere. It is New York City, so don't expect to find space to put in a dance floor, or space to turn without bumping someone else :) but the room was surprisingly spacious.
We had a great room rate, well below NYC prices, and didn't expect much but we ended up with a room on the 34th floor and a clear view of the Hudson - that was a nice surprise. 4 of us crowded into the 2 double beds without problem and the room was quiet. Oh, and the windows open for fresh air and street noises if you really want that sort of thing.
With the current scourge of bedbugs, particularly in NYC, it was pleasant to see all the precautions being taken. And the staff was quite open to discussing what measures were in place, and to helping increase everyone's comfort level. Let me emphasize, we didn't have any problems and we haven't seen any sign of unwanted hitchhikers coming home with us.
Staff was helpful and friendly. There was no in-room safe but the main safe-deposit box was east ti access with virtually no delays. 
As for location - 8th Ave between 34th and 35th. If you know NYC, you'll approve. If not, think Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens, Empire State Building, Times Square all in walking distance. And the Park and SoHo were both well within our range when we felt like it.

"“Excellent location” We stayed 3 nights at the New Yorker. I would say that it is fair and, as previously mentioned by another traveler, it serves its purpose. We wanted to be central in NY and that was achieved. Walking distance from many attractions (and close to a metro station).
The rooms are somewhat small and old. I guess each one has their preference, but I know I much prefer when the bathroom is modern and spacious. We had wi-fi in the room, and it was fast enough. For breakfast, we went twice to Tick-Tock diner which opened into the hotel's lobby. Food was okay, a bit over-priced.

Mohammed arranged for us to have a coffee maker delivered to our room and Samira arranged for extra coffee when we needed it.
Loved these two members of staff! 
There are a few areas of improvement though 1. Put a mirror over the desk so you can do ur hair/ make up, 2. Make sure people realise they must put the snoosing label on the door (so u don't get woken up 3 times in the morning - I didnt wake up - my friend did). 3.

"“Its all about the location” Whats the saying? ""Location Location Location"" If this is the case then there are no complaints about the New Yorker. Its within spitting distance of Madison Square Garden and The Empire state. Times Square ten minutes away on foot and ditto 5th avenue. However this is a hotel review site. Arrival we had no real issues however the receptionist was explaining something to the people in front. They asked her to repeat herself and she openly rolled her eyes and spoke in a slow patronising voice to the people. I walked away and let my fiancee sort out the booking. The room. This has already been highlighted that they are very small. They really are very small. The view. This was another building opposite and a drop down. (we were on the 29th floor). The toilet has also been highlighted in previous reviews and I was very disappointed with this. The original art deco towell rail was broken and replaced with a chrome one. However the tiles in the toilet were an original feature that was PAINTED over with green mat paint, this was peeling due to the heat of the bathroom and looked quite frankly Cheap. The beliefs of Frank Lloyd Wright and Eileen Grey have been reflected in the original features but have been disregarded by the current owners. There were no Tea or Coffee making facilities and I had just returned from a tour which started in NY and went to Nine other hotels all of which had Tea and Coffee. Why it wasn;t here I am unsure. I attempted to speak to the concierge, but after about a minute and a half of watching her juggle the flyers while ignoring me I decided to speak to the customer service desk. Again I waited while the man on the front desk completed what must have been a very important text on his iphone before finding out where the business centre was. I have read that other people feel it was expensive and I agree. We stayed in soho at the start of our trip the room was probably twice the size with a more friendly welcoming staff. This was a train ride away from the main tourist attractions, but the trains are so frequent and reliable (by a metro card if you are staying a week or more) that I would just travel about the city.",fluminese,2012-08-01,122005,2012-08-17,False,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Served its purpose” Stayed in this for two nights and spent most of the days out, so only stayed here to sleep. Room was very small and there was no safe or fridge or anything like that. Most concerning was that the door fit loosely and let light in around the exterior and the lock didnt seem all that secure. Apparently they have small safety deposit boxes for items like passports, but not laptops. I know rooms are small in NY, but this was very small and my friends who were also staying in NY had a much bigger room in their hotel. My fiancee loved the art deco design and styling and loved the hotel as a consequence, I didn't. 
I thought the attached diner was a bit over priced and a bit average. Second day we ate elsewhere as no one came to serve us. The place we ate at was much better with better service, food and price. I hadn't realised no breakfast of any kind was included, but that was my mistake I guess. 
Service was okay but a little slow. Had to pay $1 a case to leave them for a couple of hours on our last day. Air con was a bit loud.

"“Not worth it” I booked a room through hotwire for around 170 euros/night. When I had waited 30 minutes at the front desk, they gave me a better room as the one I booked was ""not so nice"". The room I got didn't have a holder for the toilet paper roll, enough room in the bathroom to put down your toothbrush (!) and was very dirty and old. The view was straight into another poor travellers room. Also, the only place with enough room to open my suitecase was my bed, which I had to use as a work desk. Weak.
I upgraded to a minisuite which was only available after the first night. The information given at the front desk was very confusing, many of them were very impolite and the hotel seemed to be full of drunk teenagers and families on holiday.

"“Great for what I needed” I stayed in the New Yorker for one night on my way to NJ for a business trip. I just wanted one night in the city to connect with friends and to explore the city. I've stayed in NYC a couple times before and this is definitely the best bang for the buck. As many others have said, the location is great. It's not the most ideal for sight seeing as I would prefer being between Central Park and Times Square, but being that I had an early morning train ride out of Penn Station, it was great for this trip. 
The room was surprisingly large with a great view of the Empire State Building and Chrysler building. The room came equipped with a large HD TV, good workspace, and a comfortable bed. The bathroom is bit small, but the shower has excellent water pressure and space. I could see how some women may be concerned with the size of the bathroom, but that's about the only negative I could find. Also, the restaurant nearby are okay, but you can find better places to eat just a few blocks away.

"“Great Location” Just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel paid an extra $10 per night for view of the Empire State Building could lie in bed at night and the view was fantastic. Not a big room but you are only sleeping in it. Wardrobe big enough to put two large cases in it and our clothes. Room clean, towels changed each day. Staff were very helpful on check-in, Assistance and transportation. Tick Tock Diner food very good and plenty of it.

"“Clean, quiet, excellent value, convenient to Penn Station & MSG” This hotel was perfect for what we needed for just an overnight visit for a function at Madison Sq Garden in 3/2012. Hotel is a short block or so from MSG. The room was clean, no obvious critters, very quiet (26th floor rear) with a comfortable mattress and non-allergenic pillows. I am very fussy about a room's air temp and movement and the individual thermostat control allowed me to adjust the temp exacty as i wanted it and control the fan speed. Interesting art deco lobby. Lots of food choices nearby, try Tir Na Nog Irish pub betw the hotel and MSG for surprisingly good food and Smithwick's on tap.

"“Clean but plain tourist hotel in great location” Its a fairly plain tourist hotel with a convenient location just across from Penn Station. The they've maintained the old art deco feel. The public spaces are clean but plain, and the hallways are dark, dated, and a bit dismal. Service is indifferent. The enormous lobby will be filled with tour groups. Generally the room was good. Our room was so small you had to turn sideways to walk between the bed and the dresser, but the beds were decent and the room was very clean. The bathrooms were odd - clearly some of fixtures have been replaced, but the tub and tile were cheaply painted over and were chipping badly. It's like they clearly renovated, but they cut some of corners. Let's face it though, in NYC, you generally don't spend a lot of time in the room. 
Lastly - be careful about the internet service. They have low speed free service and very expensive slightly less slow speed service. We were extremely careful about what wireless service we chose (and very knowledgeable) and they still tried to charge us for ""high speed"" service. If you want to use their wireless, be very vigilant about what you are using 
We stayed in room 2269 - a corner room with great views.
To summarize - Affordable, very clean, efficient, great location, a little run down. Acceptable tourist class hotel, not luxurious in any way.

“average” the solid thing about this hotel is the location.. steps from penn station/MSG .. the negatives were the pillows.. not very comfortable and no choice in selection.. we found strands of hair on the duvet.. that always grosses you out.. we found em only on the outside.. we were on the 26th floor yet had a view of a brick wall.. the price was reasonable as NY hotels can be really expensive.. overall it was ok.. but im not sure if i would stay here again..,hani13,2012-02-01,122005,2012-03-11,False,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Excellent holiday” Three of us (girls) went to the new Yorker hotel in march 2012 for 4 nights. We had previously booked a renovated metro room but on arrival we were upgraded to a more spacious room as there were 3 of us. This upgrade was free of charge. The check in service was very quick and extreamly helpful. The room had the best view possible and we even got a complementary call to the room to make sure we were happy with it. The room itself was very spacious and clean. Maid service every day was efficient and the staff covering the rest of the hotel were extreamly friendly and helpful. We spent most of our meal times in the tick tick diner which is located at the bottom of hotel. This diner offers everything you need and the food is very tasty and service fantastic. The hotel also offers a 24hour safe facility which is operated from reception. We had no problem at all accessing our safe so would recommend anyone uses this facility as its free of charge. I would recommend to anyone to stay in the new Yorker hotel as I have no complaints at all. The only thing I would say is that if there is more than 2 of you staying in a room it would be worth the upgrade as it may have been a bit cramped in a smaller room. Ps. If you are looking for a few gifts to take home look in the hotel gift shop on the lower lobby of the hotel as its very cheap compared to the street shops.,Phillipa B,2012-03-01,122005,2012-03-11,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good value for money. It worked!” This is an enormous hotel at 34th and 8th right by Penn Station, so there are three subway stations to choose from within two blocks, which makes this a good location if you intend to visit different parts of the city. It was surprising that the check-in and check-out worked exceptionally well with the large number of guests, and there was never any problems with queues for the lifts for this hotel with more than forty floors. The hotel is a little dated, but there are small art deco details that are rather charming and a quaint walk-in wardrobe. On the other hand, there is Internet (admittedly rather slow for the ""free"" option) and a large flat-screen television. No minibar/refrigerator in room but there was an iron and ironing board. I returned one afternoon with a lady checking the sink in the bathroom after a report by the cleaning staff of slow drainage; so they do try to get things right without the guest complaining (actually I didn't think that the water drained particularly slowly).

"“Great location but not good for tall people” Spent 4 nights in NYC thought this hotel had perfect location for shopping and sightseeing.
Prices were reasonable. 
Reception team need to work on their customer service skills though as some were quite rude, not necessarily to us but to other customers which was very embarrassing to witness. The security team though was very welcoming each night that we returned to hotel.
The rooms were clean, housekeeping team did a good job but to be honest the beds were very short in length I'm only 5'10"" (175cm) and feet went past the edge. Ultimate power showers though bordering on jet washing!!

"“In and Out” We had a great time in NYC the last weekend of January. This was the second time that we stayed at this hotel. The staff was wonderful, except for the guys that watched luggage after check out. These guys had zero personality, and actually, the desk folks were pretty curt also. They all did their jobs very well, but not a happy bunch. The concierge was spectacular! The door man had his own agenda...but in the in did us a big favor. We like the bar attached to the hotel, and the wonderful service people that worked there. 
The New Yorker is so well situated...MSG across the street. Subway right on the corner for coming and going, and within walking distance of Chrysler Building and Empire State! Fun little restaurants and little shops for food and fun.
We had such a wonderful time in NYC, we were there for 4 days, saw so much, and met so many wonderful people that were so willing to help us find where we were going and how to use the subways and where places were. We came home thinking that everything we had heard of NYC was just so wrong. Not one bad experience, not one issue with anyone. And the weather was amazing.

"“Nice Hotel, Great Location” Book in was fast and efficient considering it was Christmas Eve. Girl at check-in said we had booked a room with two double beds. Told her we only needed one, so she said she would give us a good room. She didn't lie. I think you would call it a corner suite with plenty of space in the room, large bathroom and even a walk in wardrobe type room. Add to that a beatiful view of the Empire State building, so satisfaction all round. 
On our first night we had dinner in Copper's. Would say it was a bit pretentious for our liking but food was good. Also had a bite in the Tick Tock Diner. Food was great but service was poor due some poor server being required to serve too many tables while a gentlemen who I assume to be management sat aimlessly at the till, message to management ""when busy help out"". 
As others have said, the hotel's location is excellent with subway across the road and various sites like Times Square close by.

"“Location, location!” Three of us spent a week in a one bedroom suite at The New Yorker in April 2011. The location of this art deco hotel is fantastic.

"“Room with a view” We booked a room for a week at the New Yorker. We found it a well maintained, comfortable, clean 'art deco' hotel in a safe and convenient part of Manhattan.

"“I consider staying in this place a necessary evil” I've stayed at the New Yorker probably about 10 times, usually for around 4-6 nights at a time. It's my company's standard go-to place for people visiting head office, as I do 2-3 times a year. So I don't have much of a choice of whether to stay there. To me, the most convenient thing about this hotel is its location (2 blocks from my office, 1 block from Penn Station, for easy airport access, very good for subways with the ACE outside the door and the 123 a block away).
This hotel is huge, with about 40 floors, but I don't think that it has the amenities or staff to go with that. It's not unusual to stand in line for a long time to check in. The staff on reception are very hit-and-miss in terms of friendliness - sometimes they can be courteous (in a NY sort of way), other times pretty blunt. When I was checking out this week, I had to wait 15 minutes for a bellman to collect my luggage - not because there was a line but because there was no bellman in sight. When one finally came, there was no apology for the delay.
I've stayed in a huge variety of rooms at this hotel and, since I don't actually pay for them, it's hard to know to what extent the difference is due to price or luck. This most recent stay was one of the worst ones. The room was so small that I could barely find anywhere to put down my suitcase (room 2953 for the record) and the view was pretty boring. At other times, I have stayed in pretty amazing rooms - twice the size, and one time with a view on two sides facing east to the Empire State Building and south towards downtown. When you check in, see if you can get a room with a decent view - given how high a floor you can get, it can be really worth it in terms of view.
The room facilities are fine and what you'd expect for a 4-star hotel. The bathroom decor was a little worn and the shower had the very frustrating tendency to go extremely hot then extremely cold. I think this may have been due to other guests using their showers at peak times. The walls are pretty thin - I could hear my neighbour's toilet every time it flushed and I could hear some loud evening activity (if you get what I mean) at one point.
When I was checking out, the elevators were down while the hotel investigated whether there was a fire. They came over the tannoy and told people to stay in their rooms for over 45 minutes. In the end, I just walked the 29 floors.
In terms of the hotel's other amenities, it's pretty handy to have the Tick Tock Diner on site. This place isn't great by NY standards (the nearby Skylight Diner, one block away on 34th and 9th is way better) but it's convenient. When I arrived, my TV wasn't working and someone came within 15 minutes and repaired it. The lobby area tends to get crowded and isn't really a place to hang out. I used the gym once and found it crowded and basic.
Overall, my feeling on the New Yorker is that it's ok, not great. It's less than what I would generally expect from a 4-star. Price isn't a factor for me, since work pays. If I had a choice, I think I'd investigate other hotels in the area before choosing this one.",spitze1982,2012-03-01,122005,2012-03-07,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Very dissappointing” This hotel was a real dissapointment, considering the high ranking on this website!
I found that staff were unfriendly and not willing to help. I was trying to find a laundromat and the gentlemen at the front desk explained how to get there, however I was nervous about getting lost and asked if he could draw me a map. He said it was too easy to get to, so he wouldn't draw one. I ended up walking in the wrong direction and it took me 5 minutes of wandering around in the rain to find it. When we were checking out, I found the lady at the front desk to be rude. She talked to me as if I was stupid, didn't give me clear instructions when I wanted to empty my safe deposit box and left me feeling quite embarrased.
During our stay one of the two bathrooms in our room was leaking to lower floors. During the day, plumbers came by to work on it, however the hotel did not give us any warning. This surprised me and made me feel uncomfortable.
Everytime we went up to our room, we were required to show a hotel worker our room card before we went up the lifts. This has not happened at any other hotel I have stayed at in my life. It was really just an annoyance, but seemed to me me be unprofessional.
The bathroom fittings were old-fashioned and the bathtub bottom was coated in soap scum. There was also hair stuck to the bathroom walls.
That said, there was cable television and the room (other than the bathroom) was modern and clean.
The location was ok. On one hand, it was near a subway entrance, Penn station, the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden. On the other hand, it was very difficult to find good food nearby.
After this experience, I would never stay at this hotel, or any Ramada hotel again!",alysec,2012-02-01,122005,2012-03-04,False,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.1,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Loved my stay in NYC!” I stayed at the New Yorker for a week in the middle of Feb 2012. I arrived late so was accommodated straight away, no lines for check in. My room was 3520 (on the 35th floor), I had paid online to upgrade to a view room as it was my first time visiting New York. It was well worth the $10 extra per day! The view of the city/skyline was incredible! I was looking directly at the Empire State building when I was lounging in bed! Amazing! 
The room itself was just average size but more than big enough for me as I was by myself. The bed was very comfortable and clean. The only fault I would have with the whole room was the bathroom which is a little run down and needs upgrading. The shower curtains are terrible, dirty and stained. Apart from this, the staff were all quite friendly and always had a smile for me which was much appreciated. The location of the hotel could not have been better! Very central for everything, about a 5 min walk to good shopping on the way to Macy's and Herald Square. Only 8 blocks down from Times Square which was about a 10-15 min walk. The neighbourhood was always busy and I felt quite safe walking around by myself (although never at night) There is also a pizza place and a McDonalds across the road and the Tick Tock Diner attached to the hotel, very convenient places to eat.
The hotel concierge was also VERY helpful and friendly, reconfirming my airport transfers and helping me book day tours to go on.
Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone! It's great value and a great experience!
Will definitely be staying here when I come back to New York in the future!

"“First time in NYC, so glad we picked The New Yorker” As with everything in NYC, space is at a premium so its annoying to read reviews constantly berating small hotel rooms. Our room at The New Yorker was fantastic. Clean, well sized, comfy bed and good facilities and our view was good too. For the small amount of time you spend in your hotel room it was perfect.

Paid for queen redecorated room but got a double not sure what was decorated about it, maybe the awful quilted and padded headboard.

So tired and disappointed with the attitude from the reservation desk that for the first time ever dd not complain, thought these words would speak louder.

"“A bit better second time round....” Like all the other reviews, The New Yorker has an excellent location and the wonderful Tick Tock Diner (although service can be variable) - the room we had was quite small but adequate and relatively clean but it is let down by a poor and tired looking bathroom. The hot water in the shower is extremely variable - either too cold or merely warm. If you're expecting a hot shower every day; this might not be the place. 
The attraction for us is that it is 2 blocks from the Empire State building, easy access to the Metro line (the blue line is on the corner of the hotel!), ten minutes to Times Square, BroadWay, Macy's is one block away etc etc. Wonderful location. You can't go wrong.

"“Last time I stay here.” Well, I had stayed at the New Yorker a few times before on business in previous years and maybe I've been spoiled by other places with better accommodations since then, but this is the last time I will ever consider staying at the New Yorker. The hotel has a great local on 8th avenue, close to action etc, but it's noisy b/c of that. We checked in early and were able to get to our room early, however, around 10pm at night when back in the room (mind you i travel here on business), we kept hearing a noise by our room that sounded like the freight or laundry elevator starting and stopping. So i call the front desk and ask them if this is a temporary noise that shuts off after a certain hour and they said yes after 11pm! this noise lasted ALL Night Long! I could not believe that a hotel would actually put guests in this room. We asked to be changed to a quiter location so we moved to the 32nd floor the next day and while there was no elevator shaft noise, the street noise was almost unbearable too. This is on the 32nd floor! Aside from all this, I think the New Yorker is a lovely hotel in the lobby but the beds sucked! I would compare the comfort of the beds to that of when I stayed at the Hudson, and there weren't enough covers, it's February, it's cold in New York. Also, the bathrooms are tiny and gross and old. while the rooms were updated the bathrooms are not and it's just almost like staying in a hostel. I stayed at this hotel b/c of walking convenience to the Javitts Center, but i'm definitely going back to the Staybridge Suites on 40th b/t 8th & 9th, a quiet, clean, new and most comfortable beds ever hotel that even has a kitchen.

"“Excellent hotel and location” Stayed here for three nights in Feb 2012. I contacted the hotel before hand to ask for a room with a view as it was my boyfriends 30th. They promptly emailed me back, and this was acknoweldged at check in, as well as a little box of chocolates to say Happy Birthday. As a result, we had a brilliant view of the Empire State Building which was amazing to wake up to. After check in, Mohammed rang us a couple of times to check we were happy which was much appreciated, and took the sting out of the 15 min wait to check in.
Though there was no safe in the room, there was access to individual safes just off the reception, which whilst not as convenient, still did the job.
We ate at the Tick Tock diner a couple of times for breakfast and found the portions to be humungous!
Overall, good, clean hotel, great location and would not hesitate to stay again. Check out made super easy, as you could simply drop your cards in a box by the lifts.
Special thank you to Mohammed for his attention to detail.",thumpergirl,2012-02-01,122005,2012-03-01,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location, decent room let down by bathroom” We booked our honeymoon through Thomas Cook and following a recomendation, decided to book the New Yorker as our hotel. It is listed as a four start hotel and we paid for an upgraded refurbished room. On arrival the staff were very friendly and the building looked great. The staff even gave us chocolates and congratulated us on our marriage. Our bedrrom was surprisingly small. There was very little room to menouver around the bed, however the decor and finish to the room as of the highest standard. Nice furniture, comfy bed and well presented. The bathroom however was old, had paint flaking off the walls, the sink and even the toilet sink. This was dissapointing however we were never going to spend much time in our room. The cleaners cleaned the room thoroughly daily, however them knocking on our door @ 8am every day was slightly annoying but we were up anyway. The hotel is in a great position, ideally situated for all needs when visiting New York. Both restaraunts in the hotel were of a good standard and offered a good mix.",jay-c2012,2012-02-01,122005,2012-03-01,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Fantastic Hotel” Fantastic Hotel will stay again if we go back to New York. A fabulous Art Deco building in a great location. Easy access to the subway and walking distance to many attractions particularly shopping and the theatres. Many restaurants with great menus are close by. Upgraded to a small suit when we arrived. Great views of the city from the room. Two TV,s and a mini kitchen. Hotel dining is good both for breakfast and evening meal although there is a great Irish bar across the road that does fish and chips to die for. Staff were friendly and helpful. A well priced gift shop below the lobby. Room cleaned every day. Only quirk is the plumbing, can wait a while for hot water, but saying that we were on the 39th floor.",Tomo9613,2012-02-01,122005,2012-02-29,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Old, Historic Hotel” I booked the hotel as it as listed as a 4-star through the discount travel site I used. The hotel was old but clean. They tried to make some small upgrades like a new headborad and flat screens. However, nothing about this hotel room warrants a 4-star rating. I would give it a low 3-star rating because of its location and history. 
The hotel does have a lot of amenities such as baggage check, door man, polite staff, etc. So again, there was nothing wrong with this hotel but not quite what I was expecting.
Then again, my negative experience may be just that i cannot get over the closets they give you as bedrooms in NYC.",Jon B,2012-02-01,122005,2012-02-29,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Fantastic location, great value price” Stayed for four nights during a conference and wasn't sure based on the reviews what to expect. The hotel is very comfortable -- I was actually quite surprised by the size of the room, very large bed, enough room for a desk and a fairly comfortable chair in the other corner. The bathroom I quite liked, with a claw foot tub and a old-style shower. For NYC the size was unexpected and the decor -- sort of retro art-deco -- was really enjoyable. The room was clean and I thought the service was good (though it's a really big hotel with lots of turnover so they tended to check keys going up towards the escalators which makes one feel safer I suppose unless you always get ""randomly"" chosen to have to prove you belong). Checkin/checkout was too slow. The wireless options are not great -- even with the pay option it is pretty slow. Good gym downstairs and business center. But the best thing is the location -- can't find another hotel in midtown for anywhere near that price. Right across from Penn Station and MSG, a short walk from Time Square on the one side and Chelsea on the other. Really excellent. Last thing, we had no problem with the people next door but I get the sense the walls are pretty thin so if you have loud people on any side that might be an issue.",Pablo B,2012-02-01,122005,2012-02-29,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

We did request a high floor and were not dissapointed. we were in room 3507 which was perfect for us. The room was small but perfectley adequate for two people. The heating system in the room was second to none and we were very impressed.
Yes this is a very big and busy hotel but i can honestly say we were never bothered by any noise. You will always hear the police sirens and car horns but after all you are in new york .

This Hotel is on the subway line north and south and is 8 blocks from the theatre district and 2 blocks from Madison Square Garden.

"“Sweet 16 in the City” I hosted a Girls Getaway Weekend for a group of 4 adults and 5 teenage girls. I reserved a 2 double beds room and 1 suite. The hotel was gracious in ensuring that our group remained on the same floor even though our room types were different. The hotel rooms were smaller than what I'm used to but it didn't matter because we spend most of our time in Times Square (which was a quick 5 - 10 minute walk if you're not shopping or taking pictures along the way). The shower water flow and pressure was something I actually did not like, but it would not prevent me from reserving a room at the New Yorker the next time I go to NYC.",GottaBthere,2012-02-01,122005,2012-02-27,True,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Bigger, but not necessarily better” With more than two thousand rooms and being very close to Madison Square Garden, the check-in at this hotel can become very busy indeed. However, I don't think that I have ever come across reception staff before that is capable of processing such long queues quite so quickly. And not only are they very efficient, they are also very courteous to their customers. The building has forty floors, but you are never waiting more than a few seconds for an elevator. Rooms on the higher floors offer magnificent views of the Manhattan skyline, but don't expect too much of the standard rooms. I would like to stress that our room was very small and most of it was taken up by the bed. The bathroom was showing signs of a lot of wear and tear and was badly in need of a refurbishment. To be honest, I would have expected a bathroom suite of this standard in a much cheaper, motel type accommodation. Yes, this is quite an elderly hotel that does date back to the nineteen twenties, but I'm afraid there's no hiding the wrinkles and I did expect better. Probably the best thing about the room was the flat screen TV and the view. Sleep could also be a problem here too for those that don't like a lot of noise. Even on the 34th floor the street sounds are still quite evident. TVs from adjoing rooms can also be heard if the occupants choose to have them on loud. Room service, however, is very good. And first time travellers beware. Don't be fooled by the location because of its proximity to main tourist attractions. Eighth Avenue is quite seedy compared to some other prime locations in the Midtown area. It does get very busy along this stretch due to the Port Authority terminal being only a few blocks away and I wouldn't recommend using the bars that are close-by unless you're fairly street-wise. There is, however, a decent bar and restaurant within the hotel and there is also a very reasonably priced diner attached to the hotel complex. Security within the hotel is very good, especially at night and safety deposit boxes are available at the reception area. Would I choose to stay here again? No, because there are better hotels in Manhattan.",Micklefielder,2012-02-01,122005,2012-02-27,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Very adept at chaos” This is a very busy hotel. Its location will always ensure a year-round capacity. Any negatives I could come up with, such as exhausted looking front desk staff, could be marked up to simply being far too busy. I traveled in February 2012, and the place was packed - from the diner next to the lobby, the sitting area, the front desk - chaotic, I could only imagine what it's like in August! Thing is, they pull it off. I didn't wait too long for anything, the staff were polite, rooms adequate. There are some old fixtures, the shower wasn't very good, and the bathroom was small with no counter space. The room was decorated a bit dark, but the bed was comfortable, and the free in-room WiFi was a huge plus. I made reservations only one day in advance, and got a very good rate compared to other hotels in the area. Any hallway noise was adequately muted by the well built doors/walls.

"“Amazing place to stay in an amazing city” For a first time visitor and to that fact an any time visitor to New York, this hotel is the perfect place to stay. But even better if like me, you are a disabled traveller. Couldn't have asked for a more perfect hotel to suit me.
Room was spacious enough for the wheelchair to negotiate around all parts. The bathroom was perfect for me, wheel-in shower, grab rails by the toilet, light switch at a lower height. 
Hotel is in a great location for all the main touristy sight, couldn't be any nearer Macy's. Times Square and Broadway, just short walks away. Come out of the hotel, turn left and look up and you see one of NYC's most iconic sights - the Empire State Building, first time I saw it, it blew me away. Practically opposite the hotel is Penn Station (accessible station). 
Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Room was cleaned daily and fresh towels were left. Despite being on a busy road, no noise could be heard from our room, in fact the only noise we heard was the amazing thunder storm we encountered at 3:30am on penultimate day.

"“Great Value; Great Location” Just got back from staying at the New Yorker for 5 days during the Westminster Dog Show. We were very impressed with this hotel and would go back if visiting NYC again. The hotel room was a great value in the most expensive city in the world...only $189.00 per night! Given the relatively low rate, we were not expecting much. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived to some of the nicest hotel staff we have ever dealt with. The room we were given was completely unacceptable for two people. It was no bigger than a broom closet. The woman at the front desk, ANA, bent over backwards to find us a better room (for a small increase in price) and she did so with a smile on her face. The room we ended up with was 100 times better than the first one...large, spacious and a fantastic view. We did have some problems with the thermostat and with the hot water (or lack thereof), but the hotel is an older building and we just learned to live with some of the minor inconveniences. The place was very clean and the elevators were super fast. We never had to wait b/c there was a bank of elevators that went to floors 21 and up only. Fantastic! Oh, and the location couldn't be better....right in Midtown Manhattan across 8th Avenue from Madison Square Garden.

When my boyfriend and I arrived, the lobby was nice and the valet service was impressive, however, when we got into the room there was hold chicken nuggets on the floor, hair on the shower wall, and make up on our towels. The room was TINY! I mean I have stayed in New York several times and this room has been the smallest. The bathroom resembles an old dorm, not a hotel room bathroom. They really need to be updated. Especially if they are being advertised as a 4 star hotel!!! The shower did not work correctly. A single, hard stream came out of the shower head. I did use the hotwire name your own price so maybe that is why my room was so terrible (because I had paid a discounted price). The service was good, but the amenities were sub-par.

"“Great location and great value with some small negatives” We stayed at the New Yorker over new years for 6 nights.
Firstly the location was perfect - walking distance to most of the major New York attractions such as Times Square, Empire State Building, Central Park etc. Also really convenient to bus/train stations and Maddison Square Garden is across the road. 
The rooms are a decent size however a little dated. Our bathroom had a little mould in some spots but overall the rooms were clean and more than adequate. WiFi was free and fast and the TV had a great selection of channels. The only real gripe I had with the room was the shower. At times it would work fine, other times the temperature would fluctuate between freezing and scalding hot ( seemed to be this way in peak usage times ).
I also agree with other reviewers that the hotel service is lacking a little. Check in staff and door staff weren't overally friendly and the new years eve function that our concierge had organized was nothing like was promised.

"“Second time around and loved it more!” I visit NYC many times a year for business and am always on the lookout for a great room at a great price. Having stayed here about a year ago, I knew it was a great place to stay. Rooms can differ greatly in size, even on the same floor so keep that in mind when I talk about the size of my room. Last time I got the same type of room (2 doubles) and the room was much smaller this time around where the room was an amazing size, especially for NYC!
The New Yorker has been around since 1929 and is steeped in history. The location at 34th-35th St and 8th Ave is remarkable for so many reason. We visit the Javitz so it is a mere 3 long blocks and you are there. No taxis, no buses just good ole fashion feet to the pavement. Being on 8th does put you a tad farther on the west side but depending on your itinerary that may work well for you. You are 1 long block and a few small blocks from Times Square, 3 long blocks from 5th ave and close to so many things. It is a large hotel with 40 floors and many amenities. Tick Tock Diner, which I have enjoyed both as a hotel and non hotel guest is open 24 hours a day with delicious comfort food. Right out the door in the lobby is a place to get a quick coffee and muffin for the road or to eat in the expansive lobby. There is an upscale restaurant called Coopers Tavern which I have not dined at but have heard good things about. There are escalators that go below the lobby with a gift shop and other helpful hotel amenities. The elevators are broken in 2 categories for floors 2-20 and 20-40 making most elevator waits and rides relatively quick. Key times like 8am and 6pm can have longer wait times and many floors to stop at. Overall, this is not an issue.
I requested a high floor room on both stays and received the 35th the first time and the 33rd this time. I had an amazing view of the Hudson and NYC the first time and this time I had views of the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building and sweeping views of the city in general. Quintessential New York views!! The room this time was a great space. Very large room with more than enough room for people, luggage, etc. Walk in closet gave so much room for luggage, clothing, etc with a full ironing board, iron and luggage rack. The room was very well laid out with plenty of amenities. I have gotten corner rooms both times I have stayed here so having 2 sets of 2 windows on a high floor overlooking the city in multiple directions is magnificent. The room offered a desk, desk chair, multiple phones, dream machine clock radio alarm, tons of info on area attractions and restaurants/bars, ice bucket, 3 lamps and overhead lighting, club chair, large flat screen TV with over 30 channels, individual heat/cool, windows that slightly open (about 5""), full length mirror and the above mentioned walk in closet, etc. The bed was firm but comfortable and the pillows (8 of them) range in various pillow fillers. Everything was very clean and well kept and believe the rooms were updated just a few years ago. 
The bathroom has a con but mostly pros. The bathtub is full size with an extended shower curtain rod. The water gets warm quickly and stays that way with good pressure (often an issue in many NYC hotels). It has been updated but not 100%. The pedestal sink, long thin glass shelf, mirror, wall mounted towel holder and glass shelves are all new and modern. They give you a lot more room than expected in a smaller bathroom. The tub is original which is fine but the toilet has seen better days. It sits almost up against the wall, maybe 5"" away so actually sitting to do your business could be a hassle. You can barely move one arm as it is pressed up against the wall, a tad uncomfortable. It is also about as old as the hotel, by no means new or updated. If you can get over that, than you are in great shape. I would NOT let it hinder me in staying here again and again but it is unexpected compared to many other aspects of the property.
I stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights. Every interaction with the front desk from check in to check out to wake up calls were always handled extremely well. Courteous, dedicated and had no issues with any requests. Never saw housekeeping but room was always made up to perfection. Utilized baggage check on several occasions and those guys are great! You interact with many staff members here due to the size of the property and each one I met was just as nice as the one before. 
Overall this is a great place to stay and I would highly recommend!!",octagon18,2012-01-01,122005,2012-02-06,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The hotel is in a perfect location and we felt completely safe in the surrounding areas.
The one thing that let this hotel down was the lifts failed 30 minutes before our taxi arrived to take us to our cruise ship and our cases were up 72 flights of stairs,we really panicked and asked if somebody could help us,the concierge just shrugged his shoulders and turned his back on us.Luckily for us a maid took pity on us struggling and put us in the service lift,otherwise god knows what we would have done,as the lifts were still out of order when we left and the NYFD were there.

I don't have one negative to share amount our stay there. The Staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms where clean, comfortable and very reasonably priced.
Our stay was during the festive season and many Hotels in the same league were double the price. 
The New Yorker is about a 10-15 Minute work to 5th Ave and Time Square and right opposite Penn Subway Station so getting around NYC was very easy. Should you have to travel further and require a Cab the Doorman of the Hotel will have one ready for you in no time at all.
Another bonus is the 24hour Diner that's attached to the Hotel.... Great service, cheap and decent food... We ate there at least one meal a day.

"“Old 3 Star hotel with 5 star service” The New Yorker is a famous landmark classic art deco hotel built in 1930, 
somewhat renovated in the 90's after is was bought by ""the unification church"" ( a religious cult). 
Pros: Great ocation at 34/8 right next to Penn Station. The rooms are clean although on the small side, free wireless internet, a nicely equiped gym and a 24 hr diinner attached to lobby. The servie and security are top notch, as good as most 5 star hotels.
Cons: (and the list is long) the rooms can get quite cold in the winter (ours was cold even wt the thermostat on highest seting. No safe, no bar/fridge, no coffee makers, outdated bathroms, very low pressure in shower and lukewarm water only at times. Gym had only machines ( nice new Precor brand) but no free weights.

It's also within walking distance of Times Square / theatre district, and just a 5 minute walk from Macy's. 
Our room was a nice size with queen size bed and chair. Free wi-fi in the room was also much appreciated.

"“Wyndham Rewards did not allow earning points for New Yorker hotel stay” My husband and I stayed at this hotel twice in the past 2 years during an annual dance competition event, which was held next door in Manhattan Center. The hotel staff was very accommodating in giving us a room that we wanted. We had few problems with our stays: 1) We did not receive points/miles for our hotel stay though we paid over $523 including fees and taxes, because according to Wyndham Rewards rules group rate ($ 149/night) does not qualify for any points. I think that this rule is very unfair to customers. We compared this to Hilton or Marriott, where we always earn points regardless of the group rate. If Wyndham Rewards program does not allow earning points, I recommend staying in non-Ramada/Wyndham chain of hotels, if possible. 2) The passage to Manhattan Center was not opened and dancers including us had to go out onto the street in cold wet weather in our costumes and enter Manhattan Center from the street. Hotel management could have coordinated with Manhattan Center management the passage opening either on the 1st floor or 11th floor. 3) bathroom was in dire need to updating (chipped and old tiles, painting was very old, there were 2 huge round chips in the front 2 corners of the bathtub, i.e. the size of tennis balls. This was probably due to a poor quality of bath tub resurfacing/re-grazing",MalenkayaByaka777,2012-01-01,122005,2012-02-13,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.6,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Old Style New York Hotel” Check in was very pleasant. There was not a line on a Friday at 3:00 pm and we asked for an upgrade when we got there since we booked through Hotwire. Mohammad was very accommodating and found us the best room available. For $30, we got a corner room with big windows on two walls on the 32nd floor with an almost full view of the empire state building. The room had two double beds, a desk with a chair and a small dresser with a tv on top and a closet that fit all of our stuff for the weekend. It was a small room but for an old NY hotel it is a typical size. The bathroom was small and old but functional. As soon as we got in our room Mohammad called from the front desk to make sure we were happy. For the amount of time we spent in the room the size was not an issue. The heat and hot water worked fine. The bed could have been a little softer, the mattress was a bit too firm for me. I prefer the soft pillow tops. The walls are very thin and there was a dog show in town and we could hear some barking from the rooms in the same hallway as ours. The street noise during the day was loud but sleeping was surprisingly quiet. The location is very good if you plan to use the transit system. The hotel is right across the street from Penn Station and there are subway stations all over the place. It is just about a 15 or 20 minute walk to Rockefeller Center, times square and the theaters. Macy's is just a 3 minute walk away. Overall our stay was very enjoyable. One thing that I would recommend is if you drove your car and had the hotel park it for you, be prepared to wait a long, long, long, time for them to get it for you. It took almost an hour for the valet to get our car and it was a bit frustrating but besides that, the stay couldn't have been better.",marylandusacpl,2012-02-01,122005,2012-02-12,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location and very nice room” It's always nice to come back to the New Yorker when visiting New York. The hotel was refurbished after my last visit and the new rooms are even better than before.
Since they had a nice offer the week before Christmas I decided to have a little luxury and stayed in one of the Tower Suites with a great view of the Empire State building. It seems these rooms were made by joining two rooms. So you have one living room and a bedroom with bathroom.
The location couldn't be better, bit I knew that already. Just next to the subway and within easy walking of most theaters.

"“Another good stay” We have stayed at the New Yorker Hotel many times and we always enjoy it. We can echo some of the recent reviews about the smallish size of the rooms, but we usually have a good view of either the Hudson River (through the buildings) or the Empire State building. Our room was pleasant and clean and the bed was quite comfortable. The bathrooms tend to be very small and with tile from an earlier era (although recently repainted), but they are clean and functional. What we like is the friendly atmosphere, the great location (A & C subway lines around the corner and a bus stop to Lincoln center across the street), the short-wait elevators and the Tick Tock Diner. We have usually gotten a reasonably priced room for New York City and it now just feels like home.

Nice clean room, quite spacious, two double beds and a good view on two sides (a corner room) of the city. The bathroom was period, maybe 30's or something and was an interesting touch. Food was via the Ticktock 24 hour diner and was standard USA fare, notto mention pretty much anything you wanted any time of day. We had breakfast as 3 in the morning and idd some interesting 'people watching' while having our food!

"“Welcome” I must admit I entered the reception lounge into this hotel expecting to receive a fantastic welcome to New York and the woman who booked us into our two rooms was very surly and snappy (maybe she was having a bad day but hey, she should not work with the public) Any way we booked in and decided to do the typical tourist visits. I must admit we saw all sorts of life I which was an eye opener. We then decided that we would like to visit the 9/11memorial and visited the site. When there, they informed us tickets were required. We asked how to get these as we did not have access to a computer, they informed us the hotel booking booth would do this for us.
The lady at our booth in the New Yorker was very unhelpful, she told us to do it ourself on the Internet in the basement, we explained they had informed us she would do it for us she just was not interested ( Maybe because the tickets were free and she did not get any commission) we decided to just go to the site and hope for the best. While in the hotel lounge we thought we would book our taxi to JFK and he two gentlemen on this desk were so helpful the elderly of the two rang the 9/11 memorial site for us. We would like to thank them for restoring our faith in mankind.

"“Will come again!” I stayed at the New Yorker from Jan 23-27th, 2012. My fiance and I arrived around 1pm and we're able to check in a little earlier within less than 5 minutes. I'd reccomend asking to stay higher up and ask for a good view. We we're on level 36 and had the view of Madison Square Gard along with the Empire State Building. It was so beautiful at night being lit up :) 
The room was smaller than expected but for only being in there to shower and sleep that didn't bother me. It was very clean as well :) Very conveinient location by the Subway (I didn't use) but also close to Times Sq, Empire State, and Madison Sq. Garden. I walked everywhere from Central Park (10 min walk) to the Ground Zero memorial which was around 45 mins or so but worth it.

“Great Location - Great View” My wife and I visited New York to see in the new year and wanted a Midtown hotel. The New Yorker was an ideal central location for everywhere we wanted to go. The room was small but clean and comfortable with a fantastic view of the city skyline and the Empire State Building. We had upgraded our economy room and it only cost another $10 per night for the great view. The Tick-Tock Diner next door is a great place to eat with a great atmosphere.

"“Convenient location, good facilities nearby but very small room & no view.” Had a friend stay here & after checking Trip Advisor the Hotel seemed fine. Got a good price & being our first trip ever to the USA stayed because of these reasons. Overall our stay was OK. Check in wasn't a very friendly experience. Trip Advisor comments suggested asking for a room with a view. I did this and was told I didn't book a room with this request so we were allotted one on 26th floor that I told would be OK. I had rung the hotel previously to check we would be getting one of the ""renovated rooms"" since our booking was for a metro queen renovated. I was told curtly that ALL the rooms were renovated. Well, not sure what renovated means in NYC, but room was neat and clean but bathroom a bit old with one tiny glass shelf to put 2 toiletry bags on. Very small amount of room in there but shower over bath good, but towels a bit thin. Generally whole room setup was very claustrophobic: closet door opened and hit the end of the queen bed, no room to put 2 suitcases (only one fitted in the closet) and tiny window (maybe 3 feet wide) was located in a corner of the room that no light really shone through. View was the other side of the building. I knew from Trip Advisor that rooms at hotels in NYC very small but I was unprepared for this size! Information on bed was they had pillowtops and good quality linen. There was no pillowtop and I could feel the innerspring mattress, didn't get a good sleep most nights. Well enough of the negatives! 
Pro's: 24 hour Tick Tock Diner had decent enough food; Famiglia's Pizza across road good. Some smaller places to eat around the block very good (well priced) especially an Irish Pub near intersection of 9th and 34th St. Ask at reception and they will tell you were there is a laundry (around the corner one block). Great when you haven't washed clothes for a week. Cheap, they charge by weight (per lb) then wash, fold and pack in plastic for you to take. Good location to Times Square, Empire State building etc, all within walking distance. 34th St Penn Station right beside hotel, it's large and subway connects easily to most places you want to go. Room clean and made up everyday immaculately. Very good heating that could be adjusted individually. Concierge very helpful. Transportation booking person (for airport) very helpful.
Con's: Tiny room (we paid for the basic level room); no coffee maker or kettle-apparently that is normal in NYC; no room safe, I had to go downstairs and was lucky to get a big safety deposit box to fit laptop and travel documents in. But downside was each night we wanted to collect laptop then deposit it back in the morning we had to queue up with everyone else who was checking in. There wasn't a separate desk to do so. Wi-Fi free in hotel but patchy, not always able to send emails or receive or get internet in our room the lobby was better.",Gillian S,2012-01-01,122005,2012-01-31,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Eh...” Hotel was in a great location. Close to the subway and close walking distance to a lot of tourist attractions. When we first checked in though, the lady said we had 3 reservations under my name and seemed like she didn't really have a good handle on what she was doing. I actually had 2 reservations b/c we booked 3 nights through expedia and one extra night through the hotel after we decided to stay an extra night in NY. She said we would have to return to the desk and maybe move rooms for the extra night so we would have to check out then back in. Then she gave us a room key and we went to our room and someone was already in it. So back down we go and she gave us another room and said she will upgrade us tomorrow night for what had just happened but didn't have anything at the moment. So later that night we went back to the desk and talked to someone else and he fixed the whole situation with the extra night and he upgraded us then. The rooms were both small but nice. A little dated but that didn't matter b/c we only planned on sleeping there. The walls were thin and could hear the cleaning ladies through the walls and the showers (pipes) in the rooms next door.

“Great location near Penn Station” This is my favorite hotel in NY. It's conveniently located near MSG & Penn Station. I recently spent a Sat night there. The rooms have been updated since my last stay which was about 5 yrs ago so I'm not sure how recent the reno is. Everyone was very pleasant there. The room was spotless. The towels were soft. They had nice toiletries. The bed was perfect – slept like a baby. I got an awesome rate when hotels.com had a half-price sale.

"“Perfect place for staying in NYC” My wife and I spent 4 nights here recently. From a tourist point of view the location is hard to beat. Right in the heart of Manhattan and walking distance from a lot of the major sights. A subway stop right outside the hotel for venturing further afield, Very easy to navigate around using the free subway map (available in the subway station), or there are a couple of smartphone Apps which will save valuable time and effort in getting around. Trip advisor's NY city guide and an App called ""one stop"", which will provide you with answers to all your transportation questions.
The hotel itself met with all our needs and expectations. We were upgraded ( thank you Nicole ) to a 36th floor room with a fantastic view of the ESB. 
Our check-in ( by Onelia? ) was quick, friendly and efficient. 
A lot of reviewers say the rooms are small but we found it adequate, considering how much time is actually spent in your hotel room. 
Yes the bathrooms are a bit small but our shower worked well and did the job ( If, like me, you are not a fan of shower curtains be prepared for the worst! ).
The maid service was daily and very good.....the maid(s) who serviced our room were also very trustworthy ( we left some valuable items AND a bit of cash in our room and we did not have a problem.....I know I know.... we should have used the safety deposit boxes downstairs but couldn't be bothered with the hassle. I suppose safety deposit boxes in each room would be a welcome addition.
The Tick-Tock diner was handy ( open 24/7 ) but we used it only once and it wasn't for us. This is just a personal point of view, nothing wrong with it, we just felt that there were so many better places to enjoy a meal. The coffee stall in the foyer was good, and for us caffiene lovers it was just the job first thing in the morning.
We also used the bar ( Coopers ) and it was a decent place to spend some time chilling ( happy hour until 7pm! ).
We didn't use the gym or visit the shop in the basement but did use the internet room for checking-in online and printing our homeward boarding passes, this was also in the basement and was much appreciatted.
Staff were curteous and helpful at all times and the hotel felt very safe. 
We had a late flight home and we availed the ""left luggage"" option adjacent to the check-in area. At $1 it was fantastic value and allowed us to spend our last few hours in NYC free of luggage worries. The bell-hops were very helpful and did the job of storing our luggage with the minimum of fuss.
As I said earlier we walked to a few of the must-do sights........ Broadway, Times Square, ESB and even the Rock Center were a nice stroll from the hotel. We even walked to one of the ""water taxi"" pick-up points, Pier 84, and this was a great attraction. $25per person well spent and due to the hop-on hop-off feature it will get you to a few of the major sights with ease.
All-in-all a great stay at The New Yorker and we would recommend it.

"“Good spot for Javits and other business travel” I stayed here recently while attending a conference at the Javits Center, three crosstown blocks away at 11th and 34th. You can either walk or get on the M34 bus right outside and it's a straight shot to the Center. 
The hotel is older and in some ways shows it but in the most important ways it's just what you need. The rooms are clean and with a couple of exceptions are up to date. The biggest exception is the showerheads. I read that in another review here and didn't realize what they meant until I saw it. It's essentially a fancy garden hose end. Very little if any ability to adjust. Don't expect to take any luxurious type showers. But if you just need to get clean and get out the door to your destination, it does the job. 
It was nice to see that they have security checking people out as they head up the elevators, so it did feel safe. But due to the old design of the hotel, you'll want a room not very far from the elevators because the hallways wind quite a bit and there are no fire exits at the ends of the hallways. 
The Coopers Tavern restaurant was surprisingly good. The prix-fixe dinner was tasty and included a nice salad and entree for $19.95. I will stay here again.",JerseyFlyer,2012-01-01,122005,2012-01-28,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Bad, good and then bad” Wrote a review about here a few years ago, some reason it was removed. Anyway here I got again. Stayed here on my honeymoon, and have mixed feelings about the place. 
Started off bad, we arrived late at night and they didn't have a room with a double bed, great start to our honeymoon! The room we were given was on a corridor where it could be described as a party corridor, don't get me wrong - nothing against that, but when you walk down the corridor of a hotel you don't expect to hear loud music, noise and smell dope. Anyway....next morning we were given a free upgrade to a honeymoon suite, this was cool - amazing view of the city, champagne and peace and quiet.
Good location to the hotel, very handy for everywhere.
Anyway, we had to cut our holiday short as a member of the family was ill, and we had to fly home.

"“Don't book here if you value sleep.” I was really disappointed with my stay at the New Yorker. I was placed on the 20th floor next to a bunch of 30-something males having a party. They were loud from 8pm till 5am in the morning. Security was called twice (10pm and 3am) and we complained twice in person at front desk. 
Their suggestion was to call the police. I didn't want to disturb their fun and only wanted to be moved to a quieter floor, next to the flight attendants. I had 3.5hours of sleep in total. 
The decor is really nice, small and cozy. Wifi is really slow. I rented a movie on iTunes and it was going to take 3,600 hours to download. They didn't include soundproofing in their newly renovated rooms so if you value sleep, don't book there. You can hear simple conversations through the walls from another room.
Also, lower floors are dedicated to student housing. This hotel caters more to the party type than the quiet types. 
I left a comment on their Facebook page and Glenn (Manager) posted a response by saying to contact him directly via email.

"“Central and very comfortable beds” Ideally located near Times Square, Macys department store and Empire State building, this hotel has everything you could need for a short visit. We shared 3 to a room which was smallish but suited us okay (3 middle aged females). The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, the bed linen fresh and clean. The bathroom - a bit dated, but I loved the taps which were obviously the originals from the 1920s. Good strong shower but very small towels. I had the bed by the window which was a bit cold and draughty but got an extra cover from housekeeping. Tick tock diner located in the building was ideal for breakfasts and toast before bed.

We stayed in NYC over the xmas holidays. Never been to the USA before I didn't know what to expect but it was FANTASTIC! The hotel was a very good standard, although we didn't spend much time there. The location of the hotel was the best for us really. It was close to everything that we wanted to do and if there was something a little bit further.....well there is a subway (tube) station right outside the hotel.

"“Good value for NYC” LOCATION: Hotel's location is excelent, with a whole bunch of attractions and facilities within walking distance: Penn Station: 1 block, Madison Square Garden: 1 block, Macys: 2 blocks, Empire State: 2 blocks, Times Square: 5 blocks. Fifth Avenue: four blocks. You can find all imaginable restaurants and stores surrounding the hotel.
SERVICE: Ok, this is New York, so don't expect the friendliest and warmest reception. But for city standards, service is fairly efficient. Be aware that it is a huge hotel with more than 900 rooms, so it's very possible that you'll find yourself making long lines for check-in, check-out or just for asking something. Lobby is always crowded as well as elevators, so be very patient and take your time. If you have a manteinance issue in your room i.e. expect a 1 hour waiting time for someone to come around.
FOOD: There's a diner in the hotel premises open 24 hours a day, offering good comfort food at reasonable prices. Otherwise, finding where to eat around the hotel won't be a problem at all, trust me.
ROOMS: There's a wide variety of room sizes and distributions. Most of them are really small and basic, but functional and enough for a good rest after walking around the city. As the whole hotel was redecorated around 1994, furniture is relatively new and rooms are decorated in good taste. Linens and amenities have very good quality for hotel's category and size. Again, be aware that almost every room is different in size and distribution, so make sure to contatct the hotel if you are picky or have special requirements, so you get exactly what you want prior your arrival. Otherwise, you'll be fine if you are not very claustrophobic. Some of the rooms have great views towards Empire State (try to get one of those!). Now, talking about the shower... there´s an issue! Be prepared for shock therapy!, that´s freezing cold water immediately followed by dangerously scalding one. This could be specialy delicate when staying with small children or older people. I´ve stayed several times in different seasons and different rooms and floors and it has always happened the same.
COMMON AREAS: There´s a little gym, a souvenir store, the diner andnot much more. But, again, it´s New York, so you´ll be outside the hotel most of the time.
OVERALL: If you get a good rate, which is very possible most of the year, this is a very good deal in a city of expensive hotels and not-so-good service. If you are not very picky, you will find it very convenient in terms of facilities and location.

"“New Yorker” We booked this hotel through our local Thomson travel agent to celebrate two family birthdays. 
We booked the hotels transportation service through their website which was very easy to do for a ludite. The driver picked us up from the airport and gave us a quick tour of New Jersey and New York which was excellent (all for $90).
I found the staff during check in to be excellent and good humoured.
The room was very clean and tidy, in keeping with the rest of the hotel and we were lucky enough to have a room with a fanatastic view of the Empire state and Chrysler Buildings, we slept with the blinds open as we couldn't believe how great the view was.
We ate breakfast in the tick tock diner which was reasonably priced.
The hotel has a good location for the Empire State, Times square and Grand Central station.
The only negatives were that there was no tea or coffee facilites in the room and there was an art to setting the shower.

"“Fabulous Hotel” We booked this hotel through Airmiles and after reading reviews we decided to ask for a room upgrade to a view room. This was possibly one of the best decisions ever. We had a room on the 39th floor, on the corner of the building overlooking Madison Square Garden, out of one window we were facing the Empire State Building and out of the other window we had a view towards the Statue of Liberty. On the ground floor by the reception is the Tick Tock Diner so there is no need to venture out for a fantastic breakfast, or any other meal, and it is open 24hours. Excellent food at any time.

"“Ok Not Sure I Would Stay Again” I'll start at the beginning, we arrived at the hotel around 15.30 and had no checkin ques so we begin to check in and the receptionist asks for a credit card i replied that i did not have one neither did my friend who i was travelling with ( and we had not been advised by our travel agent that the hotel would require a credit card or a cash deposit ) the receptionist then said 'oh thats ok we will accept $300 cash' i explained that i was not prepaired to give over my spending money as a deposit and she became very aggressive and rather rude, my friend then asked if they would accept a debit card and she said yes and that if we asked on check out the hotel staff would ring her bank to ensure the money was refunded in a timley manner so that was the first problem delt with. We arrived at the room and i could not complain it was lovley and spacious and a great view of the Empire State Building ( i had paid for an upgrade ) the beds were the most comfortable i have ever slept in while on holiday and the maid service was very good. We unpacked our cases then hit the streets of NYC for some exploring after an hour or so we decided to return to our room and have an early night as we had been travelling for so long, around midnight we were awoken to the most horrendous loud noise and was miffed at what it could be we contacted reception who said they would send someone up to investigate ( they never arrived ) we soon worked out that it was the neighbouring rooms shower and we soon learnt we could hear EVERYTHING again we complained and we were offered to move rooms but to be honest i could not be bothered as it was waisting precious time and i wanted to explore. We then decided to use the hotel concerige and book the big yellow taxi bus tour as it covered all the places we wanted to visit and for $35 for 2 days i thought this was reasonable so the first day we went to ground zero and when we were ready to return we made our way back to the bus stop at 14:10 the bus was due at 14:30 it finally turned up at 15:15 so i was not impressed as it impacted on the other things we wanted to do that day.
The second day we used this bus it should have left at 10:30 and finally departed at 11:00 we got off at Grand Central Station and checked with the driver who said there would be another bus in an hour form the same stop we had got off at so again we did what we wanted to do made our way back to the stop in plenty of time for the bus not to show up at all so we ended walking back to our hotel in the rain. I decided to complain to the concerige and the lady i delt with was very helpful and rang the head office to arrange a full refund and she explained that because they do not have cash on the premises the office would bring us a cash refund to the hotel and to return in a few hours ( she warned us she was soon to go off duty ). When we returned it was a different lady and she was very rude and abrupt and said it was company policy to give us a refund by way of cheque i explained we were leaving the next day and she just replied it would be sent to us in the UK i asked her to ring the head office to confirm what the first lady had said and she would not even do this and kept bleating on about company policy, i did explain she was quick enough to take my cash when we booked the trip and she did not like this comment. We then come to check out and it was the same lady who had checked us in when my friend asked her to ring the bank like she said she would she replied it was up to us to do this and complety denied saying this upon checkin i asked to see the manager and polity argued my point and the hotel finally relented and my friend was able to call her bank, i will return to NYC but must say i will probably try another hotel as i feel the New Yorker has no customer service skills which is a shame as the rest of my stay was good but this just let them down in a big way, However the hotel is located in a wonderful position 10 minutes from Macys's, ESB, and Time Square",Sarah286,2012-01-01,122005,2012-01-22,False,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Gorgeous Art Deco Hotel, Central to everything” My family and I stayed here for 11 days and absolutely loved it. The New Yorker is central to everything. Macys is only a block away, Madison Square Garden is across the road, the Empire State Building is close by... the subway station is directly next to the hotel. This hotel is perfect for any New York stay. Great diner 'Tick Tock Diner' downstairs that is open 24 hours - and cheap for New York. There are also plenty of great places to eat nearby and a great pizza place across the road - Famiglias. The hotel reflects Art Deco style and boasts a gorgeous big foyer. The hotel also offers complimentary wireless internet, a gym and much more. Rooms and bathrooms are a little small - but overall we didn't spend much time in our rooms. Staff were warm and friendly. This hotel is excellent value for money and a great place to stay. This hotel is a safe comfortable choice for New York and you can't go wrong!

"“Very pleased” Booked my visit on Priceline, got the room for a bid of US$110 per night for 5 nights, (US$550 + US$126.35 taxes and fees (23%!)). Following the advice here, I asked for a corner room up high. Room 3704 was not a corner room, and with the single window, seemed quite cramped. Although it was after 3pm, the room hasn't been made up. We called the Housekeeping, but there was no answer after 15 rings. We called the front desk, and the line was busy. Fortunately, there was a cleaning cart down the hall and after a while, checking every time we heard a door open, we were able to grab her. Not long after that we were settling into room 3715, which was the same size and shape, but which had a premium view. It has two big windows looking down on 8th Ave, facing SW toward the Empire State and Chrysler bldgs, and a third window facing Madison Sq Gardens, with the statue of liberty off in the distance. The windows transformed the room into something lovely and bright. They also gave up two coupons for a free breakfast in the very busy Tick Tock diner on the ground floor.
The queen-sized bed is very comfortable, the room is large enough for the two of us, the closet is small but very welcome, and the bathroom is large, with a full size tub.
The gym in the basement is a good size, with a large variety of aerobic and strength machines. It can be quite busy throughout the day.
Excellent location, easy to get everywhere in the city.
The only drawback is that the windows can be a bit drafty, which given how cold it can be in winter means the room can feel chilly despite the easily adjusted thermostat and effective heating system.
8th Ave is very busy, so of course you can hear the city noise, but it hasn't been a problem.",Spike T,2012-01-01,122005,2012-01-20,False,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Nice surprise” We booked this hotel in a expedia package and we get a great price with a flight from Europe. It was just a bit over 100 usd what was fantastic value. I didn't know what to expect, but the great reviews gave me a dose of optimism. In my previous travels to New York I knew what can I expect from decent nyc hotel - small rooms and not so fancy decor. So, here's what New Yorker have to offer...
Pros:
- Great location just behind Madison Square Garden
- Nice looking loby
- Excellent retro-stlye dining ""Tick-tock"" - which was nice surprise for us - always full of people, decent prices and good food. 
- Our regular room was not too small (comparing to some other nyc hotels), it was very nice and cosy.
- We were on 34th floor and elevators were super-fast
- Hotel and rooms are very clean and nice
- In this hotel lived and died great Nikola Tesla (there is even his room with a plaque on it and you can stay in it - it is on 33th floor)
- Coffee machine provided in room with several different coffee and tee flavours 
- This is a famous nyc hotel in lovely art deco stlye
Cons:
- Bathroom could be nicer
- Walls are thin
- One day there was awfull smell in hallways on 33rd and 34th floors, it was disgusting
- that's all :)

"“decent nights sleep” I stayed here for a night while i was in between apartments. Although it is located in a very central and busy area, I found the room quiet (I stayed on one of the higher floors though). It is very close to the subway and there is lots of fast food places around you open all night or until late.
The room was not big but big enough not to feel claustrophobic. The refurb gave the room a very modern feel and I liked the flatscreen LCD TV and free wifi. Most importantly, the bed was super comfortable that all I wanted to do was lie around and watch tv all day! The bathroom should have had an exhaust fan though. Also, there is no fridge in the room.
I even got a free late check out which i really appreciated.",Missyjkitten,2012-01-01,122005,2012-01-19,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Loved It!!!!!” Spent 3 nights at the New Yorker in October celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary. Couldn't fault the hotel for anything and found it be in a great location being a short walk away from so many attractions.
There were three of us (Our 17yr old Son insisted he needed to celebrate with us!!) and when booking in I mentioned it was our anniversary - We were dealt with by Mohammed who couldn't have done more for us - after about 15 minutes he came back to say he had managed to find us a room with a view of the Empire State Building (& WHAT A VIEW!!) The room was excellent with no problems regarding space or bathroom facilities. Mohammed also sorted out a coffee/tea making machine & once in the room called on the telephone to ask if all was OK and if there was anything else we needed - Big thanks to you Mohammed xxx
We didn't use the Tick Tock Diner as there tended to be a slight wait to be seated and managed with McDonalds or Starbucks for our breakfast which suited us fine as we wanted to pack as much of New York in as possible.
We did use Coopers Tavern which was situated adjacent to the Diner - We ate there on our 1st night as it was conveniant and also on the 3rd night as we had been caught in some horrific weather earlier in the day and didn't fancy venturing out again.
The free WiFi was adequate for our needs and rooms were changed daily.
All in all we had a great stay and would certainly return.

"“Ideal location for everything.” Had wonderful stay at the New Yorker in December 2011. Very friendly staff, rooms very clean, bedding and towels changed daily. The Tick Tock 24 hour Diner within the hotel is excellent value for money and was constantly busy. Food is fab. Hotel is across from Madison Square Gardens, very short walk to Macys and Empire State building. We were there to watch the Christmas lights being switched on 30th Nov 2011 by Justin Bieber and Michael Buble - crowds were in the 1000's.

"“Great Location and a Great Stay in a superb location.” Me and my partner have just spent 6 days at the ""New Yorker"" hotel and we had a fantastic time. The location of the hotel is absolutely superb and close to a subway and Penn Station and central to most other popular sites. Also very good if you are travelling from JFK airport as you simply get the Airtran train to Jamaica Stn and then transfer to LIRR train to Penn station and you are right outside the hotel for a price of $23 per person, allot cheaper than getting a taxi.
I sent a E mail to the hotel requesting a room view of the ""Empire State Building"", we were checked in by ""Mohammed"" who we found most helpful and he gave us the option of another room on a lower floor but a bigger room which we grabbed. Big thank you to ""Mohammed""
Overall we had a fantastic time in New York and found the location of the ""New Yorker"" hotel to be absolutely superb for visiting sites and experiencing ""The Big Apple"" and the service and room was great.

I didn't get to use any amenities in the hotel as I spent most of my time out. I liked the lobby. I can imagine the lobby looking the way it did back in the 50s and 60s.

My biggest complaint of the hotel was the lobby area, it was extremely dated and I was met with unfriendly staff every time I asked a question. Another issue we had was the noise in the hallway outside of our room. The hallways are EXTREMELY narrow and whenever anyone came in and out of their room you could hear everything.

"“Great location and reasonable price for a few nights” If you are coming into NYC for a night or two, The New Yorker is a great option. Two blocks from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden, it's great if you are coming in on NJT or LIRR or you are in town for a show at MSG.
We found the staff to be very accommodating and friendly. The front desk got us our room 4 hours before check-in time and every staff person we saw in the halls said hello and smiled. Definitely don't see that all of the time! 
I would caution that the rooms are very small. It suited us for one night, but if you are staying for more than 2 nights, this might not be the place for you. Also, don't even think about trying to bring in a pack-n-play or cot for a baby or toddler to share your room, it would be impossible. The only other gripe was that the cable was pretty poor in terms of channel selection and reception.
Overall, we were quite pleased with The New Yorker for a quick trip into the city.",tootsiemom,2011-12-01,122005,2012-01-16,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Diagonally across from Penn Street (arrived by train straight from Newark $12.50 which took only 25 mins or so). Subway is entrance attached to the hotel at side which was a godsend for hopping off and on. Room was great - clean, comfy bed, not massive but enough for our needs, built in closet which was ample. Bathroom was great, no problems with shower at all. Great view from the room too as high up and no noise from streets below. Requested coffee maker couple of days before by email and it arrived after I checked in.

"“Great stay” We stayed for 6 nights at this hotel and had a great stay. Check in was smooth. The receptionists were friendly and our room was ready even though we were slightly early. The foyer is beautiful, spacious and welcoming and there are ample elevators to service the building. Our room for 2 adults and 2 children (age 11 and 15) was pretty small with limited room round the beds but we were not in New York to spend too much time in our room. The room was kept very clean during our stay and it had comfortable beds and good quality linens which were regularly changed. The bathroom was a fine size and had a good shower and plenty clean towels. Our bedroom looked out over the river, which was a nice view. Free wi-fi was great and the gym, although we did not have time to use it, looked excellent. The hotel is in a fantastic location, close to many attractions and across from Penn Station. The room was not cheap but many other NY hotels were much more expensive for a similar standard. We had breakfast at its Tick Tock diner once and it was lovely, but the stall in the foyer also sold great coffee, croissants etc which we tended to have most mornings instead.

"“Wouldnt return to this hotel” Ok I know I was warned that rooms would be small in NYC but not as small as we were given! room had no closet so could not hang any clothes up and it only had a half window which looked out on a brick wall, even with all the lights on it was dark and horrid. We complained to desk and in fairness were given an upgraded room which was bigger and very bright but the closet only had hanging rails about 3ft in length (not very good as I had maxi dresses to hang). The rooms were clean but very old and not value for money. The lobby is quite impressive but beware you could get a bad room. Didnt think this was the best of locations in NYC either but obviously location is an individual choice. Also did nt really rate the Tick Tock Diner much, it was ok for one night but compared to MacDonalds and the Pizza place directly across the street it was over priced!

"“Great hotel in a very good location.” We can not recommend the New Yorker hotel enough. We spent 7 nights for the 12th - 19th August here and enjoyed every day there. From the first meeting with the reception to the last when checking out we where made to feel welcomed.
We arrived a little early on our first day but the receptionist told us we could leave our bags and a room would be ready in less than an hour. She also said she would sort out a view of the city. We stayed in room 2633 which had an amazing view of the Empire State Building straight up 34th street. In the morning you could see the Crysler building all lit up. The room was big enough for the three of us with enough wardrobe space to empty our three cases. The bath room was also big enough with room to move in. The housemaids cleaned the room everyday and did a really good job. The only thing i could gripe about was the beds where queen size beds so a little small for two people 6ft but not enough to ruin our nights sleep. The Street noise was visible but again not enough to ruin you nights sleep.
They do have security checking you have a room key before you can enter the lift area and they where always polite. I think it did help that i had my key in my hand when i got there.
We did not use the fitness centre but we used the business centre to print off our boarding passes for the next leg of our journey and this was free. We also used the hotels car service to collect us from Newark airport when we arrived and then take us to JFK when we left. The price was $10 more than it would have cost in a yellow cab and gratuity was included in the fare. The drivers where helpful and polite as you would expect and did not mind putting the cases in and out of the car. Louis even called us in England before we left to answer a couple of questions we had. Top bloke who was very helpful.
The location of the hotel was good with Maccy's and herald square just two blocks away. Penn station is just on the other corner so easy access to the subway and Amtrak trains. There are plenty of eating places nearby with plenty of choice in cuisine from TGI Fridays to Chinese and sushi. The tick-tok diner was good for breakfast but there is a counter in the foyer that sells coffee and pastries. 
Overall the hotel was just what we where looking for in a hotel.

Friendly and helpful staff was a great surprise, most know local new yorkers are not known for that.. Choosing New Yorker was such a great treat its close to all yet convenient to the lower section of the city.

Coopers bar is a nice place for a drink and something to eat, food was very tasty and reasonably priced. Rooms like most in New York are showing their age and could do with freshening up however were larger than expected. Beds were comfortable and bathrooms functional rather than boutique.

Stopped and had some food in the tick tock diner next door, a bit more expensive than other diners but it is attached to the hotel, food was still great, MASSIVE portions!!

"“Excellent location, very good but tiny rooms!!” This was our visit to NYC and were pleased with our choice based on location. The New Yorker Hotel is located right by Penn Station and is perfect for taking the metro around the city (which I strongly recommend instead of taxi cabs!) 
From the New Yorker we were able to walk to and from The Empire State Building, Times Square and The Rockefeller Center (although some of these are a bit of a trek!) It's only a short, easy metro ride to Central Park in the north and Battery Park etc in the South.
We were able to check in an hour or so early as our room was ready. The staff on the front desk were helpful. Our room was located high up, can't remember the floor number. Unfortunately we didn't have a view from our room. If we were to stay there longer, I would have requested a move. But we were only there for 3 nights, spending hardly any time in the hotel as it was, so it wasn't worth it.
The room had everything you needed. It was cleaned to a high standard and was quiet at night. We slept very well there. The main issue with this hotel is the space. I understand this is NYC and space is an issue. However, myself and my husband kept getting in each others way! The room would be ideal if just travelling for a few days, but we were travelling on to Mexico from New York, so had a big suitcase each. We lived out of our suitcases for those 3 days, which wasn't an issue, except there was no room to put the suitcases down! It really was an issue. I think if I was ever to return to New York, I might find a hotel with slightly bigger rooms. However, this was the only issue with the hotel and we had a pleasant stay.
We didn't visit the Tick Tock Diner so cannot comment on that. However, we enjoyed some drinks in Cooper's Bar, which is also attached to the hotel and the service there was very friendly.
Overall, if you're not bothered about space, then you will enjoy this hotel.",sarah_sunshine14,2012-08-01,122005,2012-08-22,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“6 Nights Without Any Major Problems” Having stayed at many City hotels over the years around the world, this has to be one of the better ones that tick all the boxes for comfort, service & location. Those that expect the equivalent of a country retreat with spa and pampering bits will be disappointed, but those that appreciate city hotels are there to serve a purpose, should be delighted!
Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly staff and I had a package waiting for me that was retrieved with no delay. The rooms were a good size for a city hotel, clean and reasonably quiet... heard drunk people opposite one night, but they checked out the next day!
The location of this hotel, which lets be honest is THE most important thing for city breaks, is ideal! A block away from Macy's 2 blocks from Empire State Building, 5 minute walk from Times Square and also 1 block away from a City Sightseeing Bus stop. 5 minutes the other way and you will find yourself on the HighLine which is well worth a visit!
The Tic Toc Diner adjoining the hotel serves great food and is very convenient, but the staff weren't the happiest, nor the quickest. We found the Skyline diner a slightly happier, quicker and cheaper alternative that is located just around the corner.

"“Ok but nothing special” The hotel was clean and the location was excellent for tourism sights, transport etc, however if you have back problems like myself, the bed is uncomfortable and they only have the one pillow available. They have a tourism desk in-house which is good.

"“Ups and downs (2011)” New Yorker was a mixed bag-the pros- Its location was perfect, if you're up for walking in the big apple it's a quick walk to Times Square, 5th avenue and Empire State building along with Penn station and main subway routes very nearby. Room was comfortable enough, clean tidy and spacious enough for 2 adults and child but a visit to new York doesn't really involve spending much time in a hotel room. Was lucky enough to have an excellent view from room facing to the east which was a bonus. Breakfast at the tick tock diner attached to the hotel was again ok, not terrible but didn't blow my skirt up either but was decent enough place to start each day. Did also like that there is a ticket outlet for shows around the city.
The cons-Staff in hotel very variable, having worked in the hotel trade I realise how important a consistent front house staff is but it really was dependent on your luck, some staff very pleasant and helpful whereas others were dismissive, short and on occasion quite rude. The biggest shock was that the rooms do not have safes and you have to use safety deposit boxes in reception for valuables so this meant daily treks down to reception in the morning to wait in line to get access to your stuff while also carrying round a box key for your holiday.
In summation-was a decent enough hotel which was clean and tidy but some little things just stopped it from being great. I am planning to visit New Yorker again in 2013 because its location was excellent for event I was in town for.",Iain B,2011-10-01,122005,2012-01-11,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Most of the staff were very unhelpful (aside from the gentleman that did check me in - he was fantastic!). There is no room service, no in room coffee or water.

"“A fine place to stay” We stayed at the New Yorker 1/6-1/6/2012 and had a perfectly nice stay. We were able to check in a little early which was very helpful-no need to check bags or lug them all over the city. The people at the front desk were efficient-not very warm or friendly, but not unpleasant. 
Our room overlooking 34th Street was nice. The bed and linens were extremely comfortable; the climate control was accurate and easy to modulate; LOVE that the windows can be opened a few inches. The bathroom was adequate-not recently renovated or luxurious, but perfectly functional. Housekeeping staff always had a kind word in the hallways. There's an active and interesting scene at Cooper's Tavern with decent draft beers and sports on tv.
Just a few disappointments- while the New Yorker website does show a Wyndham affiliation, it is very small and toward the bottom of the page-I missed it (only realized it from a digital sign in the lobby that flashed for a few seconds). We are Wyndham Rewards users and would have booked directly with the hotel had I known of the affiliation.
On leaving on Sunday morning, the line to check bags was very long and not moving at all-we didn't bother waiting.

"“Fabulous Location” We have been to the New Yorker Hotel twice now. It is a very large hotel and whilst our room on one occasion was quite small it didn't matter as we only slept there. 
The location is absolutely great with Maceys, Madison Square Garden and Empire State Building actually on the doorstep. Times Square, Radio City, Rockerfella Centre and many more attractions are all within walking distance also.
There is also a diner, Tick Tock Diner attached to the hotel and also a lovely bar and restaurant.
We took a bus tour down to Wall Street area and visited the visitor centre at Ground Zero, it was very emotional. Also went on the ferry to the Statue of Liberty. 
I have seen some negative reports from other reviewers, but I can honestly say that the staff were very helpful and friendly to us. I'm sure there may be better hotels in the area, but I'm just going on our experience,",Janet P,2011-05-01,122005,2012-01-08,False,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great value, location and service” This review relates to a stay here in April '11 but from the experience I would highly suggest it deserves consideration. I would immediately return there when next in NY. I booked directly by emailing the reservation desk after pricing on various sites. The price I secured was very decent for a 2 room suite, high up in the hotel with clear, direct view of the ESB. For the size of the room and age of the hotel, it was excellent value for NYC. There was considerable discrepancy on different sites about the exact room being booked. If you email directly you can state and secure the exact type of room without confusion. The hotel totally honoured my request and the room was beyond expectation. All hotel staff were pleasant and helpful, although a couple of times their advice was inaccurate. When I was emailed a customer service questionaire after my return home, I mentioned these minor issues and was impressed with their personal email in return to investigate the matter further. Not often do you receive such sincere customer service. 
The hotel is in an exceptional location, Penn Station is opposite, subway at the door. Convenience stores and places to eat everywhere and of course, so close to Macy's, Times Sq and ESB. 
If you book a budget room, expect budget size. It also won't be brand spanking new. It's NYC. I wouldn't suggest ticking a 'breakfast included' option, far better out on the street or in the diner attached to the hotel. Don't hesitate booking at this hotel, overall it's great value. 
Some NYC tips: 
* Book ahead your 'front of line' pass for the ESB. Crowds even at midnight are horrendous without one.
* Catch your Liberty Island ferry from Liberty Park in NJ, it will mean a $30 cab fare but what you save in line up and crowds @ Battery Point is well worth it (that applies to even pre booked tickets). There is nothing to stop you returning on the Battery Point ferry at the end of the tour and catching the subway to all places north from the South Ferry station.",MMMc55,2011-04-01,122005,2012-01-08,False,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“New Year in the New Yorker” We stayed here for a 6 nights to spend New years eve in Time Square. We took the subway from the airport which was very easy and arrived right outside the hotel. The hotel itself is local to the Empire State Building and within easy walking distance to Times Square, theatre district etc.The hotel room was basic but great for what we needed, we looked out to the Crysler Building. My only complaint to the hotel is that the safety deposit boxes are behind the reception desk and whenever you need to get to your safe you have to join the same queue as those checking in or out. You have a key and the reception has a key and they come to the safe and open it for you.One day I queued for 19 minutes, then accidently turned the key before closing the door, therefore I couldn't lock the door, I spent what seemed like a lifetime trying to get the attention of the reception to come and help me. They need to have a bell to ring to get some attention.
A must is the New York travel pass, I have just worked out that I would have spent over $145 if I had paid individally for each attraction I visited, also I had a metro pass which was also well worth the money.You can use this on the busses as well as the subway.",TravelerTracy,2011-12-01,122005,2012-01-03,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Very Comfortable Stay at the New Yorker Hotel, New York” Myself and my fiance stayed at the New Yorker Hotel for one week just before Christmas 2011 to celebrate my birthday.
The hotel was chosen by my fiance as part of my surprise trip. I have to say both of us were very pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the hotel. The reception area was impressive with its modern decor, ample seating and plenty of floor space.
The reception staff were very helpful and we were soon checked in and on our way to the 24th floor and our room. 
The room was not overly spacious, but perfectly adequate for our needs. It had a comfy double bed, drawer space, LCD TV and an en-suite which had a deep bath with overhead shower, basin and toilet. All sanitary ware appeared to be quite new and I was most impressed with the water pressure! I think I was able to fill the bath to a good depth in less than 2 minutes.
The view from our room was of the skyscrapers in the near vicinity with glimpses of the Hudson River in the background.
There is a small breakfast area on the 39th floor. I've no idea what the hotel actually uses it for, probably breakfast, and there are good views if you want to take a few photos. Mind you, it's nothing to write home about when compared to the views from the observatory area on the 86th floor of the Empire State Building!! A must for all visitors unless you prefer to go up the Rockefeller Centre.
Breakfast was not included with the room hire, which is typical of hotels in the USA. Consequently, we made full use of the Tick Tock Diner next door to the hotel and with one of its entrances located in the Hotel Reception area. The diner never sleeps, because it's a 24x7 operation and the service is excellent. The staff are friendly and helpful and there is a good choice of breakfast food; though other offerings for other parts of the day are also available. Please don't forget to tip the member of staff that serves you.
On the right hand side of the hotel, and again with an entrance located in the Hotel Reception area, is the Cooper's Tavern. It offers a good selection of food and drink, and we had a couple of very good quality evening meals there at relatively reasonable prices. Two or three hundred yards north of the hotel on 8th Avenue is the Houndstooth Pub which has an excellent menu choice. Beware, the portions are quite large! Yum.
The New Yorker Hotel, being located on the corner of 34th Street and 8th Avenue, is in a very good location in Central Manhattan and we tended to walk to most places, including as far north as Central Park, Times Square, Broadway, 42nd Street, Macey's, Madison Square Gardens...
There are also a couple of subway stations near the hotel; one for Uptown and one for Downtown. We used them to go, for example, to the 9/11 Memorial area in Downtown Manhattan and whilst in that area to catch the ferry to Liberty Island and Ellis Island.
I could go on, but I won't, suffice to say that, if you are looking for a comfortable stay in Central Manhattan, then I would recommend the New Yorker Hotel.
Oh, by the way, don't forget to go down to the basement to have a look round the gift shop. You will be surprised at the variety of the stock held in the shop, again, at reasonable prices for a hotel gift shop.
Finanlly, finally, the Business Centre is also located in the hotel basement and there you will be able to use one of the computers to undertake online check-in with your airline and print your boarding cards. The hotel offers this service free of charge, but for all other computer use you will need your credit card.",Topcat19,2011-12-01,122005,2012-01-02,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

We had a late check in but the staff dealt with us quickly and efficiently to allow us to get some much needed sleep. I had requested a room with a view as it was a special occassion and was told it would either be a view of Empire State Building or the Hudson River. We were thrilled to be in a corner room and to see both views!

Only 1 block to Macy's and ten minute walk to Times Square and Empire State building.

"“Fantastic central hotel with great views, clean room and (mostly) helpful staff!” I travelled to New York in November 2011 with my mum for Thanksgiving. It was our first trip to New York and as I am a travel agent, I did plenty of research on where to stay and what to do. We had a rather stressful journey from JFK in to Manhattan due to the holiday traffic, but on arrival at the New Yorker we were able to check in and go to our room straight away. I had emailed ahead to request a view and preferably a quiet room (this is something I now realise is probably impossible to get in this city!) Thankfully they were able to give us a room on the 21st floor with a stunning view of the Empire State Building, so it more than made up for the small amount of noise from the street below. The room was larger than i was expecting with two good-sized double beds, and the bathroom was also much bigger than I expected, with a bath and shower. 
The location of the hotel was perfect for us - literally a 5 minute walk from Macy's and the E.S.B, and only about 10 mins walk to Times Square. There are also several subway stations outside the hotel, and the sightseeing bus had a stop just over the street. We did an awful lot of walking, going right up to Central Park and back down 5th Avenue, but it meant we got to see all sorts of things we wouldn't have seen in a taxi. We also had an All Loops sightseeing bus pass for 3 days which was really useful and gave us tickets to see 3 attractions (we chose the E.S.B, Top of the Rock and the Intrepid) 
The Tick Tock diner which is situated underneath the hotel became part of our daily routine for breakfast, as well as the occasional dinner. All of the staff were really friendly and helpful, and although they were very busy they always had time to chat and ask about our day (something I didn't expect having read what people in NY can be like!)
My only real issues with the hotel relate to the reception staff. The majority of times I spoke to them they were friendly and helpful, but there were a few occasions when they were abrupt and rude, and made me feel like I was inconveniencing them by speaking to them. Other than that I had the best time and the best holiday ever in New York - so much so that I will be returning in 2012!",Steph C,2011-11-01,122005,2011-12-30,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Nothing more than Average” We stayed here in October 2011 for my partners 40th and booked on a combination of cost and trip advisor reviews. It was our first trip to New York, so I did plenty of research to find somewhere central. For this the New Yorker certainly ticks the box, its just a short 5 minute walk from the Empire State Building and around 15-20 mins to Times Square.
On arriving at the hotel we were greeted by an efficient but somewhat unfriendly receptionist who promptly took our payment and directed us to our room. All our experiences of the USA to date have been positive and we have always found hotel staff go above and beyond to make you feel at home, maybe this is different in New York but this was certainly not the case at the New Yorker.
On arriving to our room on the 25th floor we were greeted with a room just about big enough to fit the queen size bed in. We had 2 suitcases and it was a real struggle to even get into the room with them. The bathroom was about half the size of the bedroom, so by bathroom standards was reasonably large in size and had a bath, with shower, sink and toilet. We found the bathroom to be adequate, but far from 4* standards, and in need of a little update, although bear in mind that the hotel is decorated in art deco style and the bathroom is very much in keeping with this.
The hotel is also equipped with a diner (Tik Tok) which we visited once for breakfast and found to be adequate, although slightly over priced for the standard of food produced (£30 for breakfast for 2) and a bar which we visited on one evening and found to be very reasonably priced (around £6.00 for 2 beers).
All in all this is a reasonably priced hotel in a pretty good location, so I cannot complain in terms of what we were looking for as part of our short sightseeing trip. However if I visited New York again I would not stay here and instead seek out a true 4* hotel further uptown.",G00dy12,2011-10-01,122005,2011-12-29,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

There is no room service, but the room has an information folder and you can order from local restaurants, who will deliver. There is also a mini supermarket on the corner opposite which sells snacks, toiletries, alcohol and has a pharmacy.

"“In spite of the fire...” The New Yorker is a convenient hotel with good prices.
We stayed here for 3 nights. The room was small (not a surprise, really) and the bathroom needs upgrading, but it was clean and offered the basic amenities. Service at the front desk was good - I requested a room on an upper floor and I got it (although when the fire broke out and the elevators were down, I was reconsidering my request). Also, they agreed to refund part of my internet charge (more on that below as well).
My main quibble is less with the hotel and service itself, but with the rating on Hotwire. I bid on a 3.5 star hotel, and I can't consider the New Yorker in that class.The disposable plastic cups, the mutant hotel hangers, and the general dingyness of the decor puts it solidly in the 2.5 - 3 star category. If that was my expectation, I'd have rated it higher.
My only complaints are minor. The bathroom needs updating - it was unheated, the water temp was hard to control and we quickly ran out of hot water and I'm not a fan of old-school shower curtains. Also, the pillows were strangely shaped (about half width) and my husband's head kept sliding off them (he uses 2 pillows).
Finally, there's a charge for internet (which I think should be free, perhaps conditioned on joining a frequent guest program) - and most specifically there's a charge for EACH device. These days, it's common to travel with more than one internet-ready device. I had my laptop, iPad and iPhone. I was charged for all three. Luckily, after I complained to the front desk on check-out and after a bit of a delay, they agreed to refund two of the charges.
Now, about the fire. On Sunday morning, a small fire broke out in the Tick Tock Diner on the first floor. It took a little while to find the source and get it under control and, as a precaution, the elevators were shut down for about an hour. During the event, the hotel kept us informed with announcements in the hallway speakers. They told us that there was no need to evacuate and to stay on our floor. I was happy about this because I wasn't anxious to walk down 35 flights!
All-in-all, my complaints were really quibbles and I was pleased with the value I received for my money and the level of service provided by the staff. If recommend this hotel, as long as you have the appropriate expectations.",MarkBearSF,2011-12-01,122005,2011-12-20,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location for a fair price” I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel while on business in November 2011. The hotel is literally across the street from Penn station so that public transportation to/from the hotel is simple. The hotel is large so that the reception area is busy with lines. The line nevertheless moves quickly with little waiting time, and the staff was very efficient. Elevator service was good. Rooms are clean, well-kept, quiet, and relatively large; bed was comfortable; and good sized bathroom. Very unfortunate that there is no coffee/tea machine in the room. There is the Tick Tock diner off the entry floor lobby ... good service, a varied menu, average tasting food. There is also a coffee cart in the lobby with coffee, juice, and snacks. If you like being in a busy area of New York, the hotel is well situated. But if you prefer a more quiet, residential atmosphere, I would choose the Upper West Side.",shimon53,2011-11-01,122005,2011-12-20,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Mom's 50th Birthday” My family went to NYC for my Mom's 50th birthday and we stayed at the New Yorker. My parents had never been to NYC before and I wanted everything to be perfect. Everything was fabulous! We arrived early morning (before check-in) and our bags were quickly stored so we could explore the city. We arrived hours later to check-in... It was fast and the woman helping us was helpful and so kind. I had mentioned my Mother's b-day when booking and they gave her a small box of chocolates as well as complimentary breakfast at Tick Tock Diner! How wonderful! We booked a suite and our room was on the 40th floor with a great view of the Empire State Building. The room was clean and large enough for 4 guests; 2 double beds and a pull-out sofa. All beds were very comfortable and cozy! The bathroom was clean and not terribly outdated, as some reviews state. We especially enjoyed the Keurig coffee in the room. :) We ate at the Tick Tock Diner twice for lunch and breakfast. The food was great and the service was fast! It is so busy and we all commented how efficiently the restaurant runs. We also ate dinner at Cooper's Tavern. The food was great! It is higher-priced than Tick Tock, but still reasonable for NYC. The location of the hotel can't be beat... next to Penn Station and MSG, close to Macy's and ESB, and short walk to Times Square!

"“Been there twice, will be back!” Second time in NYC and second time in the New Yorker. Great location, Tick Tock diner's coffee is perfect (service is excellent too), Cooper's Tavern also excellent.
Service at the front desk was VERY friendly. Especially check-in was smooth. After a long day of travelling, my-new-best-friend Mohammed was awesome! I was tired and coming down with a flu, but Mohammed served us so well and with such friendlines, that I started to feel better. Amazing guy! Few minutes after we had checked-in and got up in our room, Mohammed called and asked is everything as it should be? It was: view to the ESB and the rest of the city was spectacular. (Tip: The higher you stay, better views you get, our room was in 38th)
I can very well recommend this hotel to anyone and we'll be back again. Hopefully next summer...
Also I have to recommend the New Yorker Rides. We used there towncar-service to/from JFK-New Yorker for the second time.

Get the train from JFK to the door for $8 each (aiport shuttle $5 from JFK to Jamaica Stn, change to Penn Stn direct $3.50). We were 10 minutes walk to Time Square. 10 minutes to Umpire St. 2 minutes Macey's. IF you go this time of year, pack little. Winter coats, jeans etc are cheap as chips in the sales at Macey's, Bloomingdales etc. We ate daily at the Tick Tock Diner... portions are BIG so best shared. Drinks are more costly than uk. $9 wine glass $5 lager. $4 Pepsi. Remember Americans expect to be tipped... rule of thumb is to double the tax on your bill to get the tip expected.

"“Great Location - Decent Hotel” We recently visited New York and spent 2 nights at the New Yorker Hotel. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a massive check-in queue and only three members of staff checking in. When we did get to a member of staff, she was rude and chose to continue her conversation with a colleague in Spanish rather than help check us in. As soon as we did check in and headed for our rooms, the lift broke and the fire department had to be called. Seemed like things were going from bad to worse. Once this was sorted the management provided a pretty good service and were more than apologetic. We were situated on the 26th floor and the rooms were small. As it is New York this was to be expected. The rooms were clean and satisfactory. The main advantage of the hotel was its location, close to Macy's, Madison Square Garden, the Empire State Buiding and only about 10 blocks from Times Square. I would suggest that our experience was probably not typical of a stay at the New Yorker but the size and quliaty of the rooms was probably indicative of 3-4 star hotels in NYC.",LeighHolford,2011-12-01,122005,2011-12-13,False,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Really good stay” i had a really nice 4 night stay here. the rooms in new york are notoriously small, and this one wasn't as small as i was expecting, there was a double bed and room to stand either side of it, a flat screen tv and a desk. all nicely furnished. the bathroom, was on the small side, but everything was clean and functional, really powerful shower too. my room was on the 22nd floor, my view was of the hotel building, so not much of a view, but i'm sure if you were on the other side of the building the views would be spectacular. check in and check out went really smoothly, the staff were friendly. the hotel is right across the street from penn station, so great transport links, (worked great for me going to a giants game) and its just a few blocks from macy's and the empire state building, also not that long of a walk into times square if you want to do the touristy stuff. 
The lobby of the hotel was really nice too, big christmas tree in there too as it's december. the tick tock diner was ok, reasonably priced. didn't eat at coopers, but it did look ok, had a couple of drinks in there though and the beer was only $5, cheap for NYC really. 
Only thing i would say i would've liked, was an in room safe, there are safes in the lobby which you can get at 24hr a day, but it's a pain having to go up and down to get something out all the time. The wi-fi, i only used the free service,( so i can't say anything for the premium service), worked pretty good, could be a bit sluggish at times, but it worked and it was free so i'm not complaining.

"“Great location and fab hotel” Recently spent 3 nights at the New Yorker to celebrate my daughters 21 birthday. We were on the 36th floor and had wonderful view of the Empire State building on one side and Madison Square Garden on the other. Staff were very helpful and polite, rooms were clean and we had a great shower. The hotel was Art Decor and everywhere was clean and tidy. Checkin was prompt with no delays. If you have a late flight, the hotel offers a transport service to the airport which works out a lot cheaper. If you ask for a fridge, they provide one at a small cost which was great for me as I took my own kettle and teabags! There is a K-Mart down the road where you can get milk. The hotel is so near to Macy's and the Empire State Buiding. The Tick Tock Diner was really good but did get busy at certain peak times but the food was good and reasonable. I could continue to write positive things as we had a wonderful time and would stay at this hotel again.

Perfectly centrally located for many touristy spots and reassuring to see staff very vigilent in aspects of security by checking all entering. The diner is reasonably priced and to a good standard.
Only negative point we found was the staff, especially in the diner, were very pushy in demanding their tips, but then again this seems the norm in New York.",Geronimo92,2011-10-01,122005,2011-12-09,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Lobby, perfect for Bolt Bus from DC” The New Yorker hotel was adequate for our needs on a recent trip to NYC. I don't know if we would stay there again in light of the huge number of hotels in the area, but I wouldn't hesitate recommending it. it is directly across the street from where the BoltBus from Washington DC drops off, so is perfect for a trip on that bus. The lobby is quite nice, and the front desk on check-in was great -- they had rooms available for early check in, which made our day easier. The room was charmingly old fashioned, which also means really small, but the view from the 26th floor corner was just what we wanted. The location was great, right near Madison Square Gardens and a few blocks from Times Square. The Cooper's Tavern and Tick-Tock diner off the lobby are each worth going to. We were a bit annoyed when we went to our room a few minutes before checkout time and neither of our key cards worked, necessitating a round trip to the front desk. I complained later to management, who sent a very nice note saying that it was probably demagnitization of our cards by proximity to credit cards or a phone, but i can't get over feeling that someone jumped the gun on changing the key. One note, we heard from someone that the hotel is going to be demolished in a couple of years.

"“Poor Customer Service!!!” I stayed at The New Yorker for 4 nights at the end of november 2011 with my best friend.
The location is good, not too far from Times Square.
The room was small, and the bathroom tiny but both of them were very clean so that was enjoyable.Concerning the shower, we struggled to regulate the temperature.
When we arrived at the reception, the check-in took ages and we've been kind of told of because my friend booked it under her company's name..
Then, the front desk agent told us 'You booked the cheapest room so it is very small.If you pay 50 dollars a night more per person, I can make you happy and give you a bigger room'
We replied that we were ok with the size of the room and were not willing to pay more for another room. He insisted again 'I can make you happy, I want to make you happy'.
We did not ask for any bigger room and the fact he was insisting was extremely annoying!
The second day, we were looking for a bus tour so we decided to ask the concierge for help...She was not helpful and far from being nice to us..
On our last day, we saw that the hotel staff could confirm our flight tickets with our airline so we asked them to do so..The answer was clear 'If you don't book the shuttle with us to go back to the airport, we do not provide this service'
I think for the price we paid, this service should be provided.

It was convenient for Penn Station which in turn was a quick transfer from Newark airport and also being in Mid Town it was easily accessible to many of the major attractions and within walking distance to many others.
But as the hotel is old and also many of the rooms were renovated they were still not a high standard.

Mcdonalds across the street, great bar in the hotel and a cafe on the corner. Excellent. Now the problems, the furnishings are oldish and could stand to be more modern retro. The rooms dont offer a coffee pot and their isnt vending or ice on every floor. All minor problems. Their are a few bums that hang out outside but hey, its New York.

"“Made a very good choice” Arrived early morning after a fabulous week crossing the atlantic on the QM2. Taxi straight to the front of this mid town hotel was great at $30. Being so early we were hoping to leave our luggage with the bellboy and get our room later at the alloted time but to our utter joy the lady on reception let us have our room straight away at no extra cost.
We had already noticed how well situated this hotel was and within less than half an hour we had left our bags in our room, freshened up and found ourselves staring up at the amazing Time Square.
We had booked this hotel along with the cruise and were happy we had been given a competitive rate but decided to guarantee a great room so we contacted the hotel direct and for $20 extra per night we got room 2658, much bigger than expected and the all important great view so extremely happy.
The attention to detail in this hotel is lovely from the fantastic bathroom fittings to the gorgeous art deco lights, we found our room immaculate and exceedingly comfortable beds. Tiny gripe is the shower whilst very powerful was hard to regulate due to its design but the bath was great so a nice soak after a long day was not a problem.
We too noticed that security is very good and reassuring here with all guests being checked subtely going in and out. All members of staff were nothing less than helpful .
We found everything very easily, taxis aplenty outside of the hotel but we decided to walk to most things, literally a 5 minute stroll to Macys and from there the sights just keep coming. 
We took the bus tour, as it was our first time we felt this was our best option, it was just ok, yes it lets you have a relaxed look around but its painfully slow, due to traffic of course and certainly not useful as a hop on hop off as too hit and miss for that, averages around 2 hours for each one. Once you have your bearings walking and the odd $10 taxi will do just as well. 
We dined out in an assortment of places, some high some low. We like the rest of the hotel no doubt on the first morning flocked into the adjacent Tick Tock diner, convenient certainly, food was completely uninspiring and expensive. Foolishly tried dinner here too after a long day and it was a car crash on a plate.
No real specials for say breakfast, a glass of juice was nearly $4 !! and the food was completley uninspiring. We ventured only slightly further afield the next morning, out the hotel , right then right again and up the road was the Starlight Diner, much better, immaculate comfy booths, cheaper menu, set breakfasts that included juice, tea and toast and above all tastier and cheaper.
There is an unbelievable choice all less than 10 mins away from all the big chains to several diners so just keep trying. We found an absolute gem in central park, the Loeb Boathouse, outstanding for brunch.
We were flying out of JFK and decided to book the hotel executive car, at $75 a bit more than a taxi but felt it was worth it, we were escorted straight to the car and a seamless hour or so later were dropped right outside our terminal. You could save around $20 I believe if you grab a taxi but we couldnt fault the transfer and the payment went on our room bill so could not of been easier.
All in all a superb stay, New York really was everything we hoped for and the hotel met our every need, would not hesitate to recommend or indeed stay here again.

"“Great trip to the US” ..having stayed at the New Yorker almost 10 years ago whilst on honeymoon, I already knew it was superbly located in the centre of manhattan. It was however a pleasant surprise as I hadn't realised it had undergone a full refurbishment a few years ago and is now even better !!!
The room we had had a large living area complete with big screen tv, couch, desk and large table and 6 chairs. The bedroom had two double beds and was finished off with some nice art deco fittings and furnishings. The view as you can see was excellent and the addition of the 'Tick Tock Diner' downstairs is great. you get a voucher for breakfast which you can either use for coffee and orange juice plus a choice of danish, muffin, or croissant which were all lovely or you can use the voucher for a $5 value towards something off the menu.
For the rest of our small group it was their first trip to the US and I don't think you could select a better place to stay for value, location and ease of getting around manhattan. The staff on the desks were helpful and you also get free use of the safety deposit boxes downstairs to keep passports or any valuables safe.

Our room on the 27th floor was perfect, a lovely clean double bed good bath room and good TV.
When you are in New York why anyone would want to sit in their room or moan about the size of it is beyond me.
The location was amazing, central to everything!!! 
On the day of my departure I rang up to ask how much it was for a late check out and Tony at reception said I could have it free of charge.
What a lovely gesture!! I left with a very positive feeling of the hotel and cannot wait to return.
I found all hotel staff very helpful and polite!!
Thank you New Yorker for my best holiday yet!! :D",CharleyGirl88,2011-11-01,122005,2011-11-22,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Westminster Gem.... once again” 2011 -- a trip booked rather last minute on priceline for an amazing (considering the dates) price.
Metro room, partial view of Empire State and Chrysler buildings. Ended up with two queen beds for the view 
(I'd wanted a king, but didn't want to switch rooms). Clean crisp linens, lovely toiletries in a handy container, clean room, pretty quiet....well, except for the Yorkies next door who liked to yap at 5am, thanks. 
A few meals at the Tick Tock, good food, fast service, reasonable prices...and the convenience of 24 hours. Again, checkin/out was ok, wish they had in-room safes as storing my computer at the front desk safes was a bit of a hassle, but I was always met with a smile...and that goes a long way.
Renovations are now complete throughout the hotel and it shows.

"“Worst service ever!!!!!!!!!!!!” I recently stayed at the New Yorkers this past weekend while attending a conference at the Jacob Javits Center. I was appalled by the service my group and I encountered from check in to check out. First, our six rooms were not ready upon check in And were told that three of our room reservations had been lost. This created a huge problem for us as we had to change quickly for another appointment. 28 people changing in one room is physically not possible. We continued to experience problems when they started assigning credit cards to rooms. They did not follow our provided room list. This caused problems later on when our group members needed to get keys. We had several people who were turned away at the elevators because they were not on the hotels room list. This was because they were referencing the wrong room list! I was awoken by a phone call because a friend was not able to go to her room. I was then forced to wake up and call the front desk/night auditor to solve the problem. Not only was he extremely rude, it took over an hour to get a second room key because the entire hotel staff is so incompetent. Understanding that security of a hotel is important, I was very calm when explaining the situation. However, he was not hospitalitable at all. This situation had occurred multiple times and should have been rectified when it first happened. We had a group member who had a credit card on file and she was not able to get a card. This should never happen.
I continued to a experience problems Sunday morning with the transportation desk. I asked a simple question regarding the location of the shuttle bus stop and the gentleman began raising his voice after I questioned him multiple times why I should walk the three avenues instead of the few blocks. I wasn't the only member of my party who was in the vicinity when he began speaking louder in a rude tone. 
I walked out of the hotel after checking out in a horrible mood because of the way I was treated. I was never asked how my stay was when I checked out. I feel as if the front desk could have rectified some part of my stay during this time but I was never given the chance to explain how dissappointed I was with them.

"“Fine hotel in convenient location” The New Yorker is a decent, thoroughly average hotel.
The good things:
the location is just a block from Penn Station which makes it very convenient if you are arriving by train. Plus the subway stop is right on the corner. Its an easy walk to Times square and the Broadway theaters, which is great if you are planning a lot of theater nights. 
The room was very clean, a reasonable size (small, but not cramped), with very comfortable beds and good linens.
We were on the 31st floor, which was very quiet, and had a nice view of the Empire state building, though the window was small and not easy to look out. 
We ate breakfast at the attached Tick Tock Diner which was very good.
The not so good things:
The bathroom was tiny, with no place to put your toiletries.
Water pressure in the shower was awful, and the it was very hard to get a consistent temperature (for me, this is almost a deal breaker.My travel companion said she didn't mind so much)
The neighborhood is a tiny bit sketchy and run down. I didn't feel unsafe at all, it was always busy even coming back from a show.

"“Excellent hotel & location to experience New York City” I have been to New York on three occasions over the past 10 years and have always opted to stay at The New Yorker.
As a British tourist looking for the full-on New York experience, the hotel is perfect. Impressive in size and recent renovations make your initial entry into the building very exciting. In terms of location it is perfect. Just off the main street from the Empire State Building and diagonally opposite Madison Square Gardens - great venue for live performances from the likes of A-list performers and major sports events.
The hotel is huge and has approximately 40 floors. One thing I would suggest is finding out the view of the room you're staying in as some look out onto brick walls whilst others give magnificent views of the city, sunset and the Hudson River. Truly breath-taking.
The rooms on my last trip here were still a little dated but the 1930's art deco style is still pretty funky. I get the impression that over time the rooms will all be updated. They were of a good clean standard though and despite being in the city, were not at all noisy as you might expect.
Adjoining the hotel is the Tick Tock diner...a real 1950's style dinner with good service and a great variety of foods on offer. More importantly it is open 24/7, so you can always get food. It is also quite reasonably priced.
As said I have stayed here on 3 occasions over the years and the price has varied quite a lot. Obviously the season you visit has a big effect. I would recommend booking as part of package deal with flights as this seems to work out a fair bit cheaper than booking the hotel directly. Expedia.co.uk, Lastminute.com and LetsGoTo are pretty good websites for this.",L4R4,2011-06-01,122005,2011-11-16,False,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

NYC is expensive and the choice areas of town are very expensive. 
I chose the new Yorker because of the location and moderate price (I wanted to be near Penn Station). I was not expecting a great experience but the checkin experience was good, the lobby is designed for high traffic so not plush, the hallways were a bit shabby, my room and bed was fresh, clean and modern.

"“A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE” I know this is a bit of a late review, but i had to write about the fantastic time i had staying at the New Yorker.

The view down 8th avenue, and towards the empire state building was fantastic. could not fault the decor or beds. Bathrom was a bit small but served its purpose. stayed a total of 9 nights. on my last night my wife joined me so i needed another room. when i went to pick up the keys i was informed i had been given an upgrade for the one night. once again the room was fantastic and had great views overlooking the hudson, and had a balcony. We where leaving for a cruise the next day but had nothing planned for the few days after the cruise. I had origionaly planned on booking another hotel in New York for the remaining part of our holiday, but went to reception and booked with them for the remaining few nights in New York.

"“An exellent stay, I would gladly return!” While planning my latest trip to NYC, I found myself in need of a hotel after the one I was considering increased its rates to a point beyond my price range. So after a search through expedia, I found the New Yorker Hotel. Funny, I recognized it from a book of mine on NYC skyscrapers! So after reading some reviews, I decided to book it. Not only is the New Yorker one of NYC's iconic skyscrapers, it's location is excellent, with 5th avenue, the garment district, the Empire State Building, and Penn Station extremely close by.
Based on the research I did, I decided to pay a little more for a view room, which gives either a city or hudson river view. Now, I really wanted the city view, facing 8th avenue. So when I called the hotel to confirm my reservation, I requested this.
Fast forward to the day of my arrival, october 27th. I walked up to the front desk to check in, and there was no record of my request on my reservation file, when I mentioned it. The desk clerk wanted to give me a room facing the hudson, but when I said that I really was hoping for that city view, he said he would see what he could do, asking me to have a seat in the lobby while he sorted things out. It took a little while, but he found me a room on the 28th floor, with a lovely view of One Penn Plaza (a skyscraper I happen to like) and the midtown skyline. He also gave me a coupon for a free breakfast at the hotel's Tick Tock Diner, as compensation for the wait. Very nice!
Later that night I had a little trouble getting the hotel's premium wi-fi to work, and none other than the building manager came to help me out. After that, I was up and running quite nicely, with no further problems during my stay. 
I did use that free breakfast coupon the next morning, enjoying a very nice (huge) waffle and sausages, with a glass of orange juice. The diner was very busy, but they kept things moving pretty well, the line to get seated wasn't too much of a wait.
As others have said, yes, the rooms are small. This is probably one of the smaller rooms I've had in a hotel. But there's lots of storage space in the closets, drawers, etc. No space wasted by a mini-bar that most of us wouldn't touch anyhow. They even have a suitcase rack in the closet, together with an iron and ironing board.
The light fixtures in the room are either original to the building, or very good art deco reproductions. Now, the bathroom fixtures such as the sink and toilet are likewise period, or look that way. So if you love sleek, modern fixtures, this isn't the place for you. But if you like art deco, this is the place for you. The lobby is gorgeous too, dominated by a massive art deco chandelier, and murals behind the front desk. Even the lights in the elevator lobbies on each floor, above the elevator doors are the original metal and glass. Somebody really did a nice job restoring this place, with lots of TLC!
A few other tidbits before I wrap this up:
Housekeeping did a great job, my room always looked great and smelled fresh after they had been through.
The in-room individual climate control was a godsend, considering the changes in weather while I was there
Security is pretty good about asking to see people's room keys before letting them into the elevator lobby.
I always found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.
In short, the New Yorker Hotel was great, I loved it there and between the price, location, atmosphere, and great staff, I would happily return, and encourage my friends to do the same.",LadyAmanita,2011-10-01,122005,2011-11-04,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“a great central location in new york for the sights” Before staying here we researched it well and everything was as we expected. It was a great base to visit all the usual tourist locations. Close to empire state building and times square and most attractions were an easy walk away (including macy's). Breakfast in tick tock was brilliant, fast efficient and exactly what you expect a diner to be like.
The subway was next door.
Would recommend the irish pub Tir Na Nog a few hundred yards away towards penn station - good meal and great atmosphere with an irish band on the weekend.
The room was small but warm and cosy. Shame there were no tea and coffee making faciities but apparently thats usual in new york. it was easy to pop to the snack bar in the lobby if you really needed a coffee.

"“The New Yorker Hotel” We only stayed in The New Yorker for 3 nights but from what I experienced it was a great hotel. The rooms were excellent. They had a big t.v and were very clean. The beds were very comfortable although you didn't get a pillow - just 4 cushions. 
The only bad thing we experienced was that when we arrived (after a 7 and a half hour flight!) my sister and I's room wasn't ready. Luckily our parent's was so we just stayed in there for a couple of hours (we did go to Macy's as well). Our parent's room was very small (we expected it since it's New York) but our room was massive. A nice surprise. 
Joined onto the hotel is 'The Tick Tock Diner' which is open 24 hours a day. It has excellent service and food although it does get very busy because it's so popular. It is also open to the public.

Staff there are lovely. Around the corner to the right and across the road there is a great eatery that has even cheaper food and an incredible selection of fruit, salads, veges and meals you could buy by weight as well as the usual bacon, egg, burger type foods.

The rooms are on the smaller side but this is typical in New York. We stayed in the basic Metro room which was very cheap given the location. I believe you can pay more and stay in a larger room. The room did have a nice comfy Queen bed of a good size. I believe at some other hotels in New York the basic rooms only have double beds.
The room itself was modern and well maintained. The exception was our bathroom. It was very dated - lots of paint chips, scratches etc. Looks like they have updated the main part of the room but not the bathroom. Also had issues with the hot water particularly in the morning. As this is an older building it appears that if multiple people close by are using the shower they can't all have hot water!! Room can be noisey at nights. If anyone talks at a reasonable level in the hallway you can clearly hear it.
What makes this hotel a good choice is the amenities. Both the Tik Tok Diner and Tavern attached to the hotel were excellent. Not only was it very convenient having them in the hotel the food was excellent and reasonably priced. Also plenty of other nice places to eat close by. 
The hotel has business centre in the basement but they need to put some information in the room so you know its there!! We didn't find out till halfway through our stay. You feel very safe in this hotel with security always checking for room keys - we noticed even those visiting without keys had to sign in and present id. This makes you feel very safe. 
The location is outstanding walking distance to Times Square, Empire State Building, shopping at Macey's, Broadway shows and even Central Park if you don't mind a longer walk (we did it one day). Starbuck, McDonalds directly across the road.
Overall a good affordable hotel in a good location. For this price it would be difficult to find something better in New York.",vesfid,2011-10-01,122005,2011-11-03,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location” Apart from a bad start with a very unpleasant and unfriendly check-in experience we enjoyed our stay in this hotel. All other staff were friendly and polite.

"“Excellent location, really helpful staff, wonderful view” The New Yorker hotel is an art deco hotel and the entrance is stunning. Even before our arrival we were impressed with the service - having read some of the reviews about the rooms, we decided to ask for an upgrdae to a suite - well worth it! Three women alone in New York and we were given a twin double bed room with a seperate lounge with bed settee. We were then spoilt with a terrace which looked directly at the Empire State Building.
Location wise, the hotel is on 34th street with Broadway and Times square starting around 42nd stree - easily within walking distance. The location was clean and comfotable - in fact the only negatives that we could say is that the bathroom, although clean, was a little dated and the choice of free tv channels was limited.
However for the location and the price I would reccomned this hotel as a base to visit the many sites from. Even the Tick Tock Diner (situated next to the Hotel) has to be congratulated for its food and its service - nothing was ever too much here.

We had changed our flights and needed longer accomodation, we asked about extending our stay, the lady at reception just gave us attitude and told us it aS going to be a rediculous $$, so we changed hotels.The view was ok.

"“Alright” I went up to the New Yorker Hotel from October 13-16 for the New York Comic Con with a group of 8 people (we booked 2 rooms) The location is great, close to the Javits Center for those interested for the convention (5 blocks away), close to Times Square, Madison Square Garden/Penn Station right across the street, Empire State Building minutes away, and a diner connected to the hotel. Duane Reade is across the street as well, so if you forget your toiletries or want some snacks it's super convenient. 
There are always complaints regarding the room size, I'm not denying the room wasn't small but it was enough for our group of 4 and our 8 bags. And let's be realistic, who goes to NYC to stay in their hotel? The room itself was fairly clean but dated. The paint/tiles in the bathroom were chipping but overall it was fine. The beds were clean and most importantly there were NO BED BUGS! The beds are a little on the firm side (not really my cup of tea) so it was a little harder for me to get comfortable when trying to sleep. My boyfriend and our 2 friends had zero complaints with that though. 
Pro's: Location (read above), quick and painless check in/out, friendly staff, clean room, no bed bugs, hold your luggage when you check out but it is $1 per bag.
Con's: No fridge, no free Wi-Fi, lack of outlets to charge electronics, a bit more on the expensive side.

The staff were great, helpful and really friendly - and offered great advice on getting around and things to see and do.

If you are expecting the Ritz you would be disappointed but was very very pleased for price, location, cleanliness and helpful staff.
Diner was competitively priced, there was also a bar conveniently attached to the hotel but we did not use this as we were lucky to have times square very close to us.

Mohammed was more than happy to do this for us plus he let us check in half an hour early. The room was on the 22nd floor, room 2239. It was very clean with two queen size beds and tv etc, plus the view of Empire State Building was amazing from two large windows. Mohammed rang the room to see if we was happy with room offered to us?

"“Amazing location. Rooms small but perfectly formed!” It is hard to find anything negative to say about the iconic New Yorker. Ok so the rooms are small, but they are beautifully decorated and everything worked (always a bonus)! I loved the art-deco touches, especially the bathroom with all its original (?) features. It was also a lot quieter than I'd expected with regard to outside noise. We were a little disappointed not to get a room with a view but not exactly surprised as we checked in late on a Saturday night. 
The Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel is fab at any time of day, with a seemingly never ending menu; we ate there at least once every day and didn't have a bad meal. We had one evening meal at Coopers, the food there is also great if you fancy something a little more upmarket! 
The midtown location is perfect - we were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to visit, although the subway is also only a block or two away.

It was immaculately clean, lovely art deco furnishings, lovely pleasant staff, view to die for. The Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel was a must for a huge breakfast but after that we went to a deli just up from the hotel as it was a tad cheaper and I could get my hot oatmeal.

"“Ideal Location” We stayed at the New Yorker in October for 3 nights en route to Vegas for my 50th birthday.This was our 2nd stay at this hotel.The reason we choose to stay here again was mainly due to the location it is next to Madison Square Garden,1 block away from Macy's 10 min walk away from the Empire State Building & Time Square. The hotel itself has an impressive art deco reception area. I would recommend anyone staying here to go to the Tick Tock Diner for breakfast, good food, large helpings (seems to be a theme in New York) fast efficient friendly service. 
As for the hotel rooms I have to say they are on the small side but spotlessly clean plus we hardly spent any time in the room as we were so busy seeing the sights. The showers were a lot better this stay no fluctuation of water temp.

"“Good hotel, conveniently located by Madison Square Garden.” I have stayed several times at the New Yorker hotel, during the last 20 years. The refurbished rooms and a general ""facelift"" have made it even better. Close to most things it
is very convenient for tourists (and others). Helpful staff and very good and clean rooms. New aircondition and nice bars and Restaurants. My favorite is ""Tic Toc"" Diner. Very 60ties!

"“Vintage Hotel, Great Service” First of all, we stayed at the hotel during the NY Comic Con when prices were way higher than we would normally spend in NYC, so I can't really comment on the value for the price. If the prices were competitive, I would definitely stay in this hotel again.
Because of the Comic Con, the hotel was VERY busy during our entire stay. Yet the staff served everyone quickly and with aplomb. We cringed at the long line to check our bags, but they had several staff working the check, and it took less time than it sometimes takes a bellman with no line to check our bags. The registration desk moved quickly and efficiently, yet maintained friendly service. We arrived too early to expect a room to be ready, but I guess our kids looked tired from our early morning train departure because the person at the desk found us a room that was almost ready and upgraded us as well! What a pleasant surprise. Even though the desk was swamped, the desk clerk, Reachell, found us when the room was ready. (Manager - please note that Reachell was great - one of the best hotel registration staff people I've encountered in recent years.)
We had a suite, which was plenty of room. It is an old hotel, and I imagine the regular rooms are quite small by today's standards. Each of the two rooms in our suite was fairly small. The great thing about the suite was that it had a real solid door between the two rooms as well as a bathroom connected to each room, so if you were traveling with kids or people with different sleep schedules, you could share the suite easily without disturbing each other.
The rooms looked fresh in an art deco style in keeping with the building. Beds and furniture were comfortable. Everything is very solid - heavy doors, tile instead of cheap wrap-around in the tub, etc. The room was very quiet as well. I would have not an inkling that I was in the middle of Midtown Manhattan if I didn't peek out the window. The hotel was booked solid that weekend, but we heard nothing from above, below or beside us. 
The location is great - a block from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden, and an easy walk to both the Javitz Center and Times Square. Subways to almost anywhere you would want to go are a couple of blocks away. We were in Astoria, Queens in about 20 minutes by subway from the hotel (door-to-door).
This is not a new, sparking luxury hotel (although everything was very clean) with tons of amenities. Some people might be turned off by that. If you want the feel of early 20th century New York with some contemporary upgrades and great service, then this is the place for you. 
By the way, we've eaten at the Tic Tock Diner (connected to the hotel) on past visits to NYC. Although fine, we much prefer the deli (Stage?) on the corner a couple of blocks down from the hotel, and the service there is exceedingly quick if you don't have much time.",Librarian1998,2011-10-01,122005,2011-10-26,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Disappointing...” The hotel is well and centrally located in midtown, no complaints about that. On the other hand at over 300 usd a night including tax, we were expecting 4 star standards and were disappointed. The 'queen' room is somewhat worn and poky, with a view onto a wall opposite. The shower couldn't regulate temperature well, the plastic facing in the bathroom was peeling. Service was brisk on checking in, and I am not sure we encountered another member of staff until we checked out. And here's the best bit. We checked out at 10am a couple of days later, and asked if we could leave our bags with the hotel for a couple of hours. Sure, was the reply, and we were directed to the relevant personnel. Who turn around and look to charge us a dollar for each of our six bags, per hour. How tightfisted can one get? We remarked to the check in desk that we had actually paid for our room until midday, the same amount of time our bags would be held for. Reception tell us, fine, but you need to queue up all over again to get your keys back and process the paperwork. Unbelievable. (And the queue to check-in was enormous). The 'bag guy' wouldn't take a neck pillow attached to one of the bags. It will come loose and get lost, we are told. Unless we want to pay for it as a separate piece of luggage of course. We try to fit it into one of our already full bags, to which he comments, unasked, ""See? Was that so hard?"" Unbelievable rudeness.

A little further away but walk-able is Central Park but the hotel is next door to a subway station allowing easy transit to other parts of Manhattan such as the Financial District or Harlem. As Duke Ellington said “take the A train!”
The hotel dates from 1929 and the interesting décor reflects the hotel’s art-deco heritage. Our corner room on the 34th Floor was large and airy and had a superb view of the Empire State Building.
The hotel staff were polite and friendly and the bell-hops and transit people were very helpful.

"“Wonderful Stay-Couldn't Ask for More!!” I was a little hesitant to book this hotel after reading so many negative views but took a chance. We stayed here for 2 nights in order to see concert at Madison Square Garden and my primary reason for choosing this hotel was its closeness to MSG. Travelling with my teen daughter and her friend, I wanted to be within walking distance from MSG. The New Yorker is a block from both MSG and Penn Station. We arrived on Saturday afternoon at approximately 1:00 pm. The reservation clerk advised that a room would not be ready until 3:00 pm. However, since I was not feeling well, she said that she would place a ""rush request"" for a room. Within 5 minutes, the room was ready. Hotel staff went above and beyond to make sure that I was comfortable.
Unfortunately, the 1st room that we received was on the 40th floor but was the wrong room. We reserved a Tower Queen Suite with a separate living room and sofa bed. After realizing the error, we were switched to a Tower Suite on the 38th floor. Btw, the standard queen rooms are very, very, small. The Tower Queen Suite was very clean and large. The separate bedroom had the standard flat screen tv, desk and a bathroom. The living room was furnished with a sofa bed, 2 lounge chairs, a large dining table, flat screen tv, kitchenette and a 2nd bath. We also had a very large deck with 2 tables and the most amazing view of the river and skyline. The room was so quiet and we could not hear a sound from the other rooms. It is the perfect room if you are travelling with kids, since you can close the door for the extra privacy.
The only minor complaint that I can add are that the beds (both in the bedroom and sofa bed), were not very comfortable. Adequate enough to get a decent night's sleep but a little too hard for my taste. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this hotel and if your budget allows, you should definitely consider upgrading to the Tower Suites. The space and view alone are worth the extra money.",calidreamer067,2011-10-01,122005,2011-10-24,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Highly Recommend, Great Location, Fab Hotel” Myself and my girlfriend stayed here the first week in November. It is located 2 minutes walk from Penn Station. It's a 5 minutes walk to Madison Square Gardens, Empire State Building and Macys and around 10/15 minutes walk to Times Square. We had an overall great experience with the hotel, very clean and helpful. Rooms are small enough, but adequate for what we were looking for. Overall I would definitely recommend and stay here again if I was back to New York. P.S.

"“Wonderful location” This was our first trip to New York and we selected the hotel from a Travel Agent's brochure. We were given a room with a fabulous view towards the Empire State building.

"“Good location and rooms newly decorated” Stayed here for business, it is well situated and quite central on 8th Avenue - about 15 mins walk to Times Square and near to Penn Station. The hotl has had room refurbishment and those that have been done are good - rooms are not large but quite acceptable. The bathrooms are a little dated but tidy in an old NY style and clean. The bar is good but as you would expect not inexpensive however the staff are very friendly. The NY Diner - part of the hotel - serves a good breakfast but again not inexpensive but fairly good value. There is no room service and no in-room bar so you need to buy bottled water etc. Also there is no in-room safe - but you can use the hotel safe facilities.. I would suggest you ensure you put serious valuables in it and other things you want to keep safe in your locked suitcase I have been hit by loss of possessions in a number of NYC hotels - I am now very cautious. Wi-fi is free in the room which is better than most central NYC hotels The hotel operate a competitive car/driver service to local airports and it is a far better experience to the yellow cabs and compares well on price.

(to a HUGE disabled suite).( ) When we went back to thank them we were given a Keurig coffee/tea & supplies replenished daily. Room Service & Housekeeping (Stacey) was above & beyond. NO BEDBUGS!!! & VERY VERY CLEAN DAILY!!!! Nothing was too much trouble. Bathrooms very spacious. Hotel's location couldn't be more central. Hotel diner & bar/restaurant prices were on par with Manhattan prices. Food in the diner was basic but good size portions. Coopers was a bit more upmarket. Walgreens, McDonalds, Wendys, Chinese Buffet, bars, clothing & shoe stores all at our intersection. Gift shop in hotel basement had competitive prices on souveniers. Tour bus stop close too.

"“Great hotel with a FAB diner!!” Stayed for 4 nights in August 2011, I emailed the hotel before we travelled and they kindly upgraded our rooms! We had a double bed each and a bath room each. 
Rooms were great, a bit small but i hear this is typical of NYC! Water in the bathroom was always hot and the beds were really comfy.
The location of the hotels was great, only about a 15 minute walk to Times Square and really close to all the Midtown locations. Theres also a great pizza joint opposite ;)
The best thing about the New Yorker is the Tick Tock diner!! After walking around the city all day sometimes you dont want to go back out again for dinner so its really convinient to have this right in the hotel. The staff always really friendly and the prices were reasonable too. The place was always packed in the mornings as its open to non residents as well. Portions were also really big and food was lovely!

"“New Yorker Hotel, New York City, Visited Sep 2011” This was our second time in New York but first time at the New Yorker. We stayed here as it had been recomended by my colleagues at Thomson and I wanted it to be special as it was our honeymoon. The hotel itself is very big, like most in New York and the room was small but it was very clean and had lots of wardrobe space for all of the new clothes we bought. We stayed on the 33rd floor but it was never a problem as the lifts were very fast and reliable. Last time we stayed in Times Square and struggled to find good, reasonable food but this time we had no problems at all because the hotel has its own diner and restaurant. The diner was exactly how you imagine an american diner to be and I looked forward to the experience every day.
The location of the hotel is second to none, right next to Macy's and perfect view of the empire state building. Was central to everything and much easier to get around than last time. We found in Times Sqaue that it was just too busy and you get so much hassle from the touts that everywhere takes twice as long to get to. However you dont get this up at the New Yorker and you are closer to the tube stations,shops and bars.
We went to an amazing Korean one night called Hang Kawi I think and it was the best authentic food and restaurant I have ever been to. It does not look much from the outside but go inside, you wont be disappointed.",Flower10911,2011-09-01,122005,2011-11-08,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“It's Okay” Recently I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel in NYC. The hotel itself is massive, millions of floors and rooms. I got a room and it was a bit run-down, however the cost and the room matched each other. There was no room-service available, but there was a 24 hour diner next to the lobby and lots of pizza places and a McDonald's across the street. Also there was no mini bar, but then again all of that goes along with the hotel. It was interesting to stay there as it still has all the art deco fixtures, even in the elevators, despite them being a bit run-down. I would definitely stay here if I had kids or not a lot of money or had never been to NYC before. The stay was very friendly and helpful.",kelly186338,2011-10-01,122005,2011-11-08,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Improvement over previous stay” Despite staying at a double/double room with a view of the Hudson River during my second stay (view of the Empire State Building from a room on the 35th floor and higher is simply unbeatable), there was a lot more positives than a year ago - the room was immediately ready upon my arrival, the check-in went smoothly, the bathroom was clean and I did not notice any water temperature fluctuation in the shower. There was free WiFi internet available in the lobby and in the rooms. The staff of the Tick Tock Diner was very friendly and the food was delicious. In addition, the new Foursquare special gets you free continental breakfast at the diner for each day of your stay if you have not claimed the special before, which was a very pleasant surprise. Considering the hotel has an excellent location, probably the only drawback would be the not very friendly staff at the reception - had to find out about the Foursquare special from the app itself and had no idea there was a gym at the hotel until filling in a customer satisfaction questionnaire after I had already returned home.",rebelphoto,2011-10-01,122005,2011-10-22,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

It was extremely convenient just a short walk down to broadway, Madison Square Gardens not too far to Macey's and the Empire State and close to Penn Station. If you opt to go without the hotel breakfast there's fabulous and classic breakfast diner just on the corner.

"“Good hotel in a great location” My wife, daughter and I visited the New Yorker Hotel in March 2011 on our first visit to New York and the states. Booked through Hayes and Jarvis after hours of research on Trip Advisor, we were pleased with what we booked.
A good price, great location, friendly staff and a clean although very small room, it served a purpose for what we wanted. The Hotel lobby was very grand for a 1920's designed hotel with very friendly staff. Our room located on the 20th floor was more than adequate for the purpose without spending too much. Only complaint was that the room was too small but compared to London Hotels, I would say it was a better standard.
We used the hotel bar one evening so my wife and I could spend a few hours alone. Service was good and the atmosphere was very typical city bar, filled with a variety of people, it was busy. Only complaint was the prices..... 
Tic Tock dinner was used once for an evening meal because we were so tired that we couldn't be bothered to go looking else where. Food was good and prices were fine. Would visit again. 
One thing I would remember if I returned was that there was no tea/coffee making facilities in our room but you could go down into the lobby where a friendly chap sold hot drinks for a reasonable price. We would probably take a travel kettle again!
Just across the road from the hotel was a 24 hr shop that sold everything, bit like a Tesco Express and the subway was just outside.

After searching reviews online, I finally settled on the New Yorker hotel, and I am glad I stayed there! It was a comfortable setting. The staff, especially Benny at the information desk, were helpful. Madison Square Garden and Penn Station were very close. Times Square was within walking distance.

"“Great location helpful staff” We stayed at the New Yorker in August 2011. The trip was originally meant to be for 5 nights but hurricane Irene hit while we were there and meant we ended up spending 8 nights in the hotel. Staying somewhere during a natural disaster certainly gives you a very unusual insight! All I can say is the New Yorker came out glowing. Staff were friendly and calm in the face of adversity. Many of them could not get home after finishing work and other staff could not get in to start their shifts. Everyone carried on with a smile on their faces and did everything they could to help out the guests, many of whom were upset and worried.

“Great Location and Life Saver” We had great stay at this hotel after our booking fell through at the New York Renaissance Guest House. It was expensive but well worth the money and I think comparable for New York Hotel prices. The best thing about the hotel is the Location. Right by Penn Station it is close to the subway and easy to get around New York from here. It is in walking distance from the High line park a must in New York and has a tiktok Diner which does amazing breakfasts. Also of note nearby is the international gourmet kitchen ad place where you can grab a great bite to take away.

"“Perfect location” Ideally situated for us...we were able to walk from Penn Station despite dragging heavy cases. The lobby/reception area is impressive and busy, the other common parts don't live up to the expectation. The room was small (others have said this, so we were half expecting it) but it was well furnished with modern facilities and a comfy mattress. Not much of a view, but didn't expect one. We ate at the Tick Tock once but like other diners in NYC, food is expensive (in compariosn to UK) but conversely the meals are enormous. Location - 5mns from Macys, retail outlets everywhere. It's also almost immediately above Penn St subway.
Did I mention the free Wi-fi - why can't all hotels offer this? 
The hotel is very busy but seems to cope with the flow....for us - it met our budget, was ideal for getting around Manhattan, and acted as a good centrally located base for getting out and about.

"“Great hotel, Nothing to complain” My wife and I stayed in the New Yorker 16th - 25th of august. It was our honeymoon. 
We arrived to the hotel at about 3pm and check in was really fast. While checking in we asked a room which would be quiet and not near the elevator. I got a corner room on 31st floor. Room was great. It was big enough for two adults and our luggages. Bathroom looked quite old but it work as espected and we did not spent there more time than was neccesary. View was good also as you can image from that high.
Room was quiet and only once we heard noices from our next door guests. Cleaning personel did not ever bother too early, as someone mentioned here. We used ""Shhhh..."" sign on to door and no problems. While we were out they cleaned our room and did very good work.
From hotel's two restaurant we used only Tic Toc diner a couple of times. Twice for breakfast and once for lunch. Service was reasonably fast and wood was as good as espected. We did not espect to get gourmet meals. Staff was friendly and efficient.
Concierge services were also good. Once we reserved ticket via her to the ESB. A couple of times we asked information at the beginning of the day and she was always friendly and smiling.

"“good location and nice hotel” Hotel is in a great locaion near to Macys and near a couple of the tour bus stops. Tick Tock diner downstairs is 24hrs and often busy but service is quick and good and food is lovely!
Had a lovely big room which I didnt imagine from what you read about New York hotels and a view of the top of the Chrysler building which was nice lit up on a night.

"“New Yorker, New York, New York. So good they named it thrice!!” Beautiful 1920's Art Deco hotel in very central location. Rooms clean and comfortable, not huge but they aren't in NY. Easy walking distance from many major attractions such as Times Square, Empire State Building, Maceys, Maddison Square Gardens, etc. Yellow cabs are plentiful and fairly cheap but we tried the subway. A little trickier than the tube (possibly due to familiarity) but very cheap and convenient. Don't listen to the horror stories, the subway is clean and safe. we used it to access areas like central Park, China Town, Little Italy and to catch ferries to see the Statue of Liberty (closed the day we went, so check in advance) and Ellis island (worth spending a few hours in). Top tip is to visit the Empire State Building early in the day, we went at 8:30, as the queues are tiny. There were only two other couples at the top. Do NOT pay a tourist guide to take you up, they are unnecessary.",AdamsandAubrey,2011-11-01,122005,2011-11-14,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Room 3112” The hotel is centrally located and convenient to many things. Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are one block away. Macys and Empire State Building are within three blocks. Times Square/Theater district is a 10 minute walk away. We used the hop on/hop off tour busses to navigate the city. Dunkin Donuts and a variety of chain restaurants are on the block for quick meals. A Duane Reade drug store is across the street for necessities.
There is a tavern in the hotel for eats and drinks. The Tick Tock Diner is open 24 hours and is a good place to start or end the day. They have a take out coffee/pastry counter for those on a tight schedule.
Reading reviews, there was a concern about the size of the rooms. We booked a New Yorker Queen room. It is advertised as being larger and had ample space to come back to each night. The room had a seating area with a desk and chair plus an upholstered chair. A small refrigerator was under the desk. The bathroom did not have a vanity, but had a sink with shelves for toiletries. Looking at the evacuation map, some rooms do look smaller. It seems like the seating area would be the adjacent room's bathroom.
Our reservation was made through Ramada's best rate guarantee. Getting the cheapest rate and an additional 10%, I expected to get the worst room in the hotel. The room overlooked Madison Square Garden and had a nice view of the Empire State Building. The hotel allowed an early check in. They also provided bag storage (for a nominal fee) after checking out. We were very satisfied with our stay.",Rocket_J_Squirrel18,2011-11-01,122005,2011-11-14,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Location doesn't make up for Incompetent Staff” Let me start by saying that I rarely give 2 star reviews and I have never given just one star but what happened to us at this hotel leaves me no choice.
Let me start by the positives... and the only reason that they have one star: the location and the size of the rooms. The hotel is positioned in a great location that is walking distance to Time Square and the rooms are a good size. The decor is a bit tired but not bad- a nice art deco feel. So... if you never had to deal with the staff, this would be a fine option. But you do.
Not one employee was polite or smiling. Some of the rooms in our group weren't ready until 5 pm. They messed up our reservations so poorly that one name was on every reservation despite our attempts to remedy this which meant that when three of us were locked out of our room, despite the fact that one of our credit cards was on the room, we weren't able to get back in, even with our ids. No one apologized for the inconvenience that this caused at midnight but they were perfectly content leaving us stranded in the lobby. While they were so concerned about this ""security"" problem, they had no problem giving one of us (unasked) a printout of the names of all of the guests at the hotel and their room numbers so that we could find which room our other friends were in. That is a security breach- and a legal one. Problems will always arise at a hotel and that doesn't mean that it is not a fine establishment. But ignoring the problem and not recognizing a remedying a fault proves 
Additionally, the bellman who was busy Facebook friending a guest, couldn't find our bags that we stored (and if storing bags there is a charge although I can't really say what it is because it seemed to change with everyone despite the number of bags) and the valet stared at me blankly when I said I was looking for a cab.
The staff acted as though they didn't care about their jobs, which is a good thing because if they keep up this behavior, they won't have them much longer. I will never be returning to the New Yorker hotel.",danielleybelle,2011-11-01,122005,2011-11-13,False,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good location but that's about it” Centrally located next to Madison Square Gardens and the art deco lobby is pretty spectacular but it just sets you up for a bigger disappointment when you get out of the lift and walk along a dark, dingy corridor with flickering lights and peeling paint.
Our room was the tiniest I've seen, smaller than student halls even and was well in need of a revamp. Out of the 3 stops on our honeymoon, this was the only hotel that didn't do anything to acknowledge it and generally the staff were very harsh & abrupt.",Katie_and_Craig,2011-06-01,122005,2011-11-13,True,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.6,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“All in the eye of the beholder” My first impression wasn't very good, the room felt quite drab & dreary and though everything was quite clean on the surface, I started noticing the black marks around the light switches and doors etc. I took a wet cloth to the inside of the bathroom door and was a bit apalled at how much dirt it picked up. Like many hotel rooms, they never seem to get a real thorough scrub. 
The sink was a real pain, the stopper only came up a crack so that it took forever for water to drain, just washing my face I had to keep turning off the water so the sink could drain. The water temperature in the shower took several minutes before it became hot.
The staff were hit & miss, some were helpful & friendly and others not so much. The business office downstairs was great to go and print my boarding pass for free & the gift shop down there had souvenirs as well as toiletries.
The location was very handy and I felt quite safe walking around this area day or night. After 3 nights the hotel started to grow on me & I know from my research that it is probably about the best you can get for the price so I lowered my expectations a bit and started to see it in better light. 
I had originally booked a metro queen, but after reading some of the reviews about how tiny they were decided to upgrade to a queen, glad I did because at least I had about 5 ft of floor space on both sides of my bed and two windows yet the room still felt really small.
Just when I had come to the conclusion that the hotel wasn't bad at all, the bellman coerced me (was extremely pushy) into taking ""a taxi that the hotel has a partnership with on a flat rate"" instead of taking the metered NY taxi - should have gone with my instincts, because the trip on a early Sunday morning with no traffic at all that took about 15 min to Laguardia would have cost about $20 but ""John's Limo"" charged me $45 so obviously the partnership is the bellman gets a nice little commission from John & the customer gets totally ripped off. Very dissappointed in the hotel staff's lack of honesty & integrity in this area.
This really is the type of hotel where everyone's experience will differ from another. Depending on what type of room you book & which staff you encounter and whether the decor seems funky to you or just old and tired. For me the price was the selling point & not really anything else.",Vansportsfan,2011-11-01,122005,2011-11-20,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.1,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Pleasantly surprised!” I was traveling alone on a business trip, which I extended one day for a bit of sightseeing. The location of this hotel is good - directly across the street from the 34th - Penn Station subway, just a few blocks to Times Square and the Theater District. There are always a lot of people around so I never felt unsafe walking around - even at 11:00 at night.
The art deco style room was very nice, a good size, perfectly clean, and everything was in working order. The bed was very comfortable with very nice pillows, the heat in the room was very comfortable.
I was on the 20th floor and there are plenty of express elevators to take to to the 20th-40th floor.
Front Desk staff were very friendly and check-in/check-out was a breeze. They will also hold your bags for you when you check out for only $1.00/bag.
The area is perhaps not the very best, it is on what seems to be the outside edges of where tourists are, but for the price and the proximity to some of the major tourists areas and subway lines all around you really can't beat it for the price.

We booked at $299 per night at first then saw it on sale for $249 so re-booked. Anywhere but NYC I would have felt ripped off at that price because the room furnishings were 50s modern. The rooms could be updated but then they would have to raise the price, I suppose, but they were fairly spacious compared to most NYC hotels.

All the staff were friendly and efficient. Rooms a little small but clean and well decorated. (Apparently all rooms are small in New York). Didn't spend much time in the room anyway. Tic Toc diner attached at one side is excellent with friendly staff. Bar at the other side is a little expensive both for meals and drinks, but plenty of 7 - 11 stores close by where you can by your own wine / beer and save cash.

"“Great location, but a missing laptop left a sore taste...” My husband and I stayed here for two nights to attend a basketball game at Madison Square Garden after taking the train from DC where we started our vacation. The location was amazing and had no complaints about our room. However, as we were packing up to leave I noticed that my backpack felt very light. I had brought my work laptop with me in case something came up that I needed to take care of, but had not needed it so it was never taken out of my backpack. When I looked it my backpack, I was shocked to see it missing. After thoroughly searching our room, I called down to the front desk to report it missing. The front desk manager and security personnel came to our room to search themselves and question us. I understand that it is probably common for people to misplace items or lose them in the city and so they wanted us to retrace our steps, but at a point I felt the the questions became a little ridiculous. We were promised that the housekeeping would never take anything from the room and they made more than me so they would never steal something (....how do they know how much I make?...), but they would check into who had access to our room. About half an hour later we received a call that they had my laptop (THANK HEAVENS!!!) and wondered if I have mistakenly left it on the housekeeping cart...WHAT???...At first I thought they were joking, but apparently not. I was told that my laptop was found on a housekeeping cart the prior day and then was later told a slightly different story that it was actually found in the hallway by the housekeeper and put it on the cart before turning over to security. At the end the hotel implied that possibly someone got into our room and was trying to take the laptop and the housekeeping found it afterwards. Okay, I guess that is a possibility. I still have several questions, such as if they had the laptop since the prior day why did they not know that when I first called? I was told they were going to proceed with an internal investigation. I am not sure what actually happened and there is a possibility that it may not have been housekeeping, but all in all I just felt it could have been handled better. Never once got an apology or a decent explanation, but I guess the most important thing is that I got my laptop back. My advice would be to leave your valuables at your own risk.",SIBlain,2011-11-01,122005,2011-11-19,False,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great location, tell your friends” We have just come back from a 4 night stay here and had a great time. However I feel the check in experience was spoiled by Mohammed, who made it too obvious he was wanting a tip for what he said was "" upgrading us""! He kept telling us we had only booked a basic room and he had managed to upgrade us, and how we should come back to reception to thank him if we were happy with the room. He even called us in the room after abut 5 mins to ask if we liked the room. On the way out I gave him a $ 50 bill, as a thank you, he wasn't that impressed. The tic tick diner is attached to the hotel and serves good basic food, but still can't believe they give you a card at the end of your meal suggesting you should leave at least 15, 18, or 20% . The hotel also has a bar/restaurant attached but at $10 for a wine and $ 10 for a beer is pricey, and the service isn't that good either. One show I say is a "" Must"" is Times Scare ! Turn left out of the lobby, keep on the same side of the street and after approx 10 mins your there ! There's a magic show, and a scary tour afterwards or before ( it is unreal don't miss it ) there is also a trendy bar in here with nice people. Your only a 5-10 min walk from Time Square, Broadway etc. There is a big ticket office there, and we went about 5.30 pm and got discount ( 40% off) tkts for the 7pm show for that night. We found the transfer driver from the airport very rude, never talked to anyone, threw the cases in, even talked and txt on his mobile while driving ( pretty much the same on the way back ).

We checked in with ease, the room was clean (no sign of the bedbugs some others had mentioned) and relatively quiet for the city. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable I've had in a hotel. The transportation desk was friendly and immediately helpful with maps of the city and subway system. The Tick Tock Diner was an excellent amenity to have available, we just popped downstairs for breakfast each morning, then headed out for the day. Diner staff were efficient, remembered us day to day, and joked around with us.With the hotel located at a subway stop, it was easy to return to the hotel to drop off bags or stop and rest for a bit before heading back out. Highly recommended. The shower was the only drawback, never did manage to regulate the temp, so showers were taken rapidly between the scalding and freezing spikes. All in all, that is a minor complaint, the overall impression was a great one, and I will stay here again.",K S,2011-12-01,122005,2011-12-05,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Small rooms, average service, sweet location” We stayed in the New Yorker for one night on a business trip...and I probably wouldn't want to stay any longer. The rooms are small, probably big enough for just 1-2 people who aren't looking for an oasis but a place to sleep after touring NYC. The bed was very comfortable but I thought it was strange that the blanket they gave us was so thing, so as a result we had to blast the heat on all night. Wasn't very impressed with the bathrooms. They definitely need updating and it gives the feel that no matter how many times you clean it, it still feels kinda dirty. It's definitely very different from any Sheraton, Holiday Inn, Marriott or Radisson I've ever been in. 
That being said, the location was unbeatable. It was a quick 10 minute walk to Times Square, Macys and endless shopping is right at your fingertips. The subway is also just right outside the hotel making it super convenient. 
Also as a side note....as soon as I got into the elevator and arrived on my floor, I got this super weird vibe. If you've ever been on the Tower of Terror at Disneyland this is exactly what it looked like. Probably because the hotel is so old, but I definitely would be afraid of staying here by myself overnight.",canadian_bot,2011-12-01,122005,2011-12-17,False,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good location” We stayed here for 5 nights in September 11. Our room was on 25th floor and was rather small but adequate, we didn't spend a lot of time in there except for showering & sleeping! Clean and well equipped. Concierge very helpful & full of information. Location is great, only 5 mins walk to Macys, Empire State Building or 10 mins to Times Square. Easy to get around on foot or subway, Penn Station is just across the street. Tick Tock Diner is value for money, very busy 9 am - 10 am but worth the wait.

The location was brilliant and so close to times sq. The rooms weren't massive but as long as they were clean and well stocked that was fine with me as i spent the majority of my time shopping and sightseeing withmy 2 friends. The room was very tidy and clean and the beds were incredibly comfy. I loved the tick tock diner also. very busy diner but we were seated quickly and had very good service. I also loved that it stayed open 24/7 especially after a late night at Charlie O's in Times sq :-).

"“Dont Hesitate, Extremely Good Hotel.” My partner and I travelled to NYC on the 16th Sept - 21st Sept.
We arrived at Newark, waiting for us was a driver which I booked through the hotel's website, very proffesional and friendly, this cost me $90, which is not too bad as we did not have to wait around for a taxi and the car was really nice.
We arrived at the hotel, and on first impressions i thought to myself i have done the right thing as the hotel was well furnished bright and elegant, the check in staf were all smiling, happy to help and quick at getting us checked in.
I had already emailed the front office manager (Glenn Merone) and pre booked a room with a view at a extra cost of $10 per night (BARGAIN) he was quick with his responses and everything was done without fuss, we stayed on the 37th floor and Glen had given us a wonderful room with a view of the empire state, the room was very clean, well furnished and of a good size for a couple. The house keeping was very good, sheets changed when asked and towels replaced when asked. The rooms are equipped with a hairdrier, flat screen TV with a range of new movies, phone, fully controllable AC/Heater, showers are powerful and the water warmed up quickly, beds comfy.
The hotel's location was great, only a couple of blocks from MACY's, and a very short walk to the empire state and times square, there are plenty of shops nearby for food, toiletries etc.... There are people who have said they felt unsafe in the area, personally i felt safe throught the city day or night and the area where the hotel is located i found was no problem at all.
The Tick Tock Diner, was a great place to start your day for a breakfast and served pretty good coffee, although we did not eat there in evenings the food im sure is pretty good.
So all in all, a very good stay, we have recommended this hotel to numerous friends as it seems everybody is visiting NYC this year, two of our friends have already booked it.
**********DO NOT BE PUT OFF YOU WILL ENJOY YOUR STAY************, im not easily impressed with hotels and this is a place i would return for sure!

"“Lovely affordable Art Deco property” When you walk in you are struck by the Art Deco feel of the property. It is inviting. The staff were efficient. My room was very small and would have been too small for 2 people. The towels were also miniature. The rooms were clean. Some ladies who traveled with me had a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms, probably from the renovation reducing the number of rooms. Great option for families or women travelling together. The location is very good although the taxi drivers preferred to drop you at the corner instead of in front of the hotel due to traffic. The Tick Tock Diner is nice and the coffee bar in the lobby is a godsend. I enjoyed it athough it is a no frills type of room But then again, who goes to New York and stays in their room?",Born-on-Rt66,2011-11-01,122005,2011-12-03,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“convenient location, reasonable hotel” stayed with wife and two pram dependent kids here for 4 nights. was given larger room by clerk when he saw we had two young kids, helpful staff member went the distance to be of assistance. hotel is 60+ years old or something and renovated a little while ago. tidy rooms, and cleaning staff very good (even set up fluffy toys we had for kids!). saying that, wife saw one mouse but i think this is endemic in NY and as said, the hotel is originally very old! NY is very loud, but only noise to violate the room is ambulances or police sirens. ideal with rooms only starting from level 20 so street noise not an issue.
no kettle or microwave for kids milk but most hotels don't. location was fine. able to walk to to times square with double pram easily at all hours (10-15mins). however, too far for central park. was great when left for long distance train from penn station, as this is about 30 seconds away and just dragged cases and prams to the station. was also easy walk to Javits convention centre (had conference on there) and from here, also easy to walk to USS intrepid aircraft carrier and museum on waterfront.",AussieHrvat,2011-11-01,122005,2011-11-29,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location, too bad the hotel doesn't match” The online photos of the lobby are misleading. The room furnishings are very outdated. The bathrooms were cramped and the faucets were rusty. The staff were very helpful over the phone, but that service was nowhere to be seen upon arrival and departure. Now onto the good points, the location is great. Only a few blocks from Time Square, yet nowhere as busy. The subway station is on the same block of the hotel, which is very helpful. While they do offer an airport shuttle, it costs $75 per person. Not worth it considering the LIRR and the Air Tran cost about $13 total per person and takes all of 45 minutes.",Ruben-Anthony,2011-09-01,122005,2011-11-29,False,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Adequate, but very disappointing” Stayed at the New Yorker over Thanksgiving week. Was pleased to be able to get an early check-in...until we got to the room. The bathroom was rusty and very small. The bedspread had dried on who knows what the hell it was and the bed was as comfortable as pavement. I can deal with a small bathroom and I threw the bedspread on the floor, but I cannot sleep on an insanely hard mattress for four nights. I stopped at the front desk to inquire about possibly moving to a different room with a hopefully more comfortable bed. The rude front desk clerk laughed at me and said that ""all beds in that type of room are the same, and that no she would not allow me to try another room."" Later in the day I stopped down again and spoke to another clerk who was just as rude, but at I was able to talk her into at least letting me check out another room and its bed. She gave me the key, and lo and behold the bed in this room (which was the same type of room...a queen(actually double) bed) was much more comfortable. The bathroom was slightly larger too. The clerk let me switch rooms, but if looks could kill, I'd be dead. After that first day my stay was adequate...except for when I thought I could stop the elevator door from shutting with my hand. LOL...dumb dumb dumb. I'm lucky that it only wrenched my wrist between the door and wall. If it had been my fingers or hand, it could easily have broken them. It took me three hard tugs to get my hand unjammed, while the idiots on the elevator who wouldn't hold the door for me refused to hit the door open button. My wrist is still bruised a week later.
As for Tick Tock Diner, we gave them one chance. My friend ordered an omelet and I ordered eggs over easy and pancakes. The waitress returned with our food in less than two minutes. The eggs had a lovely long black hair on them and the pancakes were cold. In my entire life I have only sent back one dish, but there is no way I'm going to eat eggs garnished with hair. I asked the waitress how she was able to return with our food so quickly and she said that they just keep making food before people order and it sits up there ready to be delivered to the tables. Ridiculous! I don't care how busy a diner is, you don't pre-make eggs and pancakes and let them sit around until someone orders that specific item. She replaced both the items, but if I had to guess, I would say she picked the hair off of the eggs and returned them to me. I would never go back to this diner and the only thing that keeps it in business is the oblivious tourists. Locals would NEVER eat here.",SMD3737,2011-11-01,122005,2011-11-28,False,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“very good stay” We stayed in the new yorker for four nights , December 2011, i cant complain at all The room was clean and the bed was ""very"" comfortable , the only downfall was no tea/coffee making facility in the room. The room was cleaned daily and was warm with good heating facilities. We had a street view but could not hear the traffic. The bathroom was smallish but clean and suitable. The night staff were very helpful, the night porter especially. The tick tock diner is open 24 hours so you can buy food or drinks through out the night and take them to your room. The location is ideal, a ten minute walk from time square. There is a TGI fridays and 24 hour chemist and store across the road. It is across the road from maddison square garden and penn station so ideal for underground links. The food in the tick tock diner was great and the service was quick. There was sometimes ques to get in in the morning but i guess this reflects how decent the place is and it can get busy late in the evening, being 24 hours it is also open to public. You have to show your room card when attempting to enter the lifts which indiates decent security. The hotel reception allowed us to use their phone twice to call the airport over a lost case and set up shuttle arrangements for transfer. There is an extra coffee stall near the tick tock diner where you can buy beverages all day. The check out time is 12.00 noon which is ideal for most flights home and they store your case for a very small fee. cant complian at all and would stay again.",cheryl s,2011-12-01,122005,2011-12-16,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“appalling” my girlfriend and I stayed one night in the New Yorker Hotel. 
Given the majority of good comments and the great location, we though we'd enjoy the stay. 
When we arrived it took us almost half an hour to check in. No staff member seemed to care about the situation and not a word of apology for the wait. 
The room was smaller than a shoe box and the small window was opening on a very close wall. 
The carpet was worn and there was a smell of tobacco in the corridor that went into our room on several occasions. 
The room was noisy and it was common to hear the neighbors. 
The cherry on the cake was to be asked to pay for them to keep our luggage even though we could have kept our room longer. 
The manager refused to hear anything and his best response was ""it's only a few bucks"". 
Altogether this experience reminded me of some bad airlines in Europe. Pay a lot, be mistreated by arrogant staff and feel uncomfortable for the whole stay.

Macys is only across the road so you can shop and leave your stuff in your room after . The security at the hotel was good and i never had any quibbles about leaving stuff in the room. the room, like all New York rooms are small but was great for us, a nice comfy bed, a cupboard, desk and drawers. the bathroom had a bath with overhead shower and a constant supply of hot water. reception staff were great and the tick tock diner was great for breakfasts and snacks.

Not sure if they always have someone posted at the elevators checking to see if you really are an occupant of the hotel, ( i know they do post one for parade related dates) but for worried travelers it's a nice touch.

"“brilliant after an upgrade” Recently stayed her with friends visiting NY for 5 nights. Our first night rooms were I think the most basic, they were high up ?29th floor but had no view out and were very small. I could not recommend them at all.
We upgraded to small suits each with a separate sitting area, on 40th floor. The view from there was amazing, we could see in 2 directions from 4003, both South and West all over NY. (4003 only had a west view). The extra cost of about $300 for 4 nights was very well worth it for the views alone.
The hotel itself was clean and the staff helpful and friendly, although I found the booking agent in the main lobby to be not very helpful, she seemed to be only interested to sell packages for tours, presumably she had a cut.

"“Ok, not brilliant” Unfortunatley NYC is expensive so if you are on a tight budget and dont want a hostel your options are limited. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable.. They are also very tiny. I have stayed in tiny rooms before and have managed fine, but the layout of the room is bad so you will trip over your bags. The bathroom is old and in dire need of an exhaust fan - you had to shower with the door open and not bring anything in as the steam would get everything wet - I had to make sure I didnt have a hot shower like I normally like, something you shouldnt have to do. The housekeeping staff hassled us on a few occasions to clean our room - I generally only need my room done every 2 - 3 days and them hassling me to clean my room to get their tips was annoying. I understand The Pennsylvania is a not as great hotel, but has bigger rooms and if I was to go to New York again would stay there or Clarion near Times Square.

(Although my parents in another room had a completely modern bathroom which was excellently done.) The room was obviously recently refurbished with new furniture while keeping the art-deco aesthetic with original doors, and reproduction lights. The one problem I have with it was that the beds were a bit too small for a couple really. I would have preferred one bigger bed over the two smaller ones. 
The hotel as a whole had lovely art-deco features, a beautiful chandelier and was in a good location. Our travel agent did not make us aware that a credit card was needed on check in and $180 would be taken as a deposit.

At this hotel there was a diner attached that had a great menu and a selection for breakfast, the hotel also had ""Coopers Bar"" which had excellent food and a good atmosphere. The staff were friendly and helpful , they also have an airport shuttle available or will organize transport to the airport.

"“expensive, and old, small rooms” This hotel can have very good views of manhattan towards empire state building, if you ask for it.
However the rooms are small, though clean. And the hallways were very old and made the place look crummy.
The 24x7 open ticktock diner on the bottom is a plus, the location is good too, only a 10 minute walk from times square.
The hotel is too expensive for what it offers in my opinion, even charging for simple things as luggage storage, but provides an ok lodging nontheless. 
A big minus was bad noise isolation from hallway, got woken upp often, some times by very loudly chattering cleaning maids in the hallway by 9 AM, a big minus for not respecting customers sleeping!",Cenk O,2011-09-01,122005,2011-10-03,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.9,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Good location, easy to find & friendly staff” We will be checking out tomorrow morning after a 9 night stay in a suite on the 40th floor. On check in, we were given free breakfast for our stay- continental on weekdays in the hotel and full American on weekends, which was a nice surprise.
It is on top of Penn station, so as soon as we walked up the stairs of the subway, we found the hotel. This was a major relief after a long haul flight. It is also within walking distance to times square, Macys and the Empire State Building.
Our room had a bedroom and lounge room with a mini fridge, sink and coffee machine (which also made tea). I did hear people talking in the elevator and heard the standard rooms do not have a coffee machine. We had views downtown and could see the Statue of Liberty (you can see the Empire State building from the side facing the street).
The room was very clean and had a bath over the shower. The only complaints I have are extremely minor- the air conditioner in the lounge room was loud, one of the bedside lights did not work and the toilet roll holder was in an awkward location",twisty1977,2011-09-01,122005,2011-09-30,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“One night stay” My sister and I went to New York for a birthday trip. We stayed at The New Yorker because I had Wyndham points, so the one night stay was free. I arrived about an hour before check in because of my flight time and l was able to check in early. The front desk was really friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and had a wonderful view of the city. My sister was able to connect her ipad to the internet easily. We needed to store our bags after check out until the evening.

The only complaint was that the bathroom had no where to set toiletries, except a tiny glass shelf over the sink. I would definitely stay there again.

"“Excellent Stay-Great Location” My family and I just stayed at the New Yorker Hotel (DEC22-DEC26) and experienced a wonderful stay surrounded by a helpful and caring staff. Our room was on the 22nd floor. We were in a suite with a beautiful interior and a wrap around balcony that had an awesome view of ESB. The location of the hotel in Midtown made it possible for us to walk or subway anywhere in the city very quickly. The shopping and atmosphere in Midtown was fantastic. Our room was very clean and large enough to handle myself, 3 teens and wife. The bathroom however was not. There is not a lot space or shelving in the bathroom which would have helped. The staff was ready and eager to assist; from the front desk and room cleaning to the bellman, concierge and door man.

"“average” My husband and I are currently at the New Yorker on day 3 of our 8 day stay. After reading reviews on this website , we decided to email before we arrived to ask for a quiet corner room and received a response a few days later saying that our request had been confirmed.
I must say that I""m a little confused by all the good reviews on here as our stay has been somewhat different.
The bad 
1. Our room is no bigger than 8ft x 12ft - which i agree is not ideal but not a big issue as you should not spend your days in your hotel room. I call it my 'cell' as I currently have a cold so am spending more time here than I would otherwise normally do.
2. You cannot control the hot and cold water. I have had a hot shower with the hot water completely turned off, and this morning had a cold shower with the cold water off. You cannot seem to be able to control the temp at all. Maybe it depends on who is using the hot water at the time? It certainly isnt safe for children to be exposed to this sort of temp. My husband came out the other day with bright red skin because he couldnt control the temp.
3. The bath towels are no bigger than a childs towel. I am small person - size 6 and even I am struggling to dry myself.
4. The bathroom is original but it is clean. I'm not a fan of the shower curtain, especially in a hotel that rates itself 4*.
5. No Fridge or tea/coffee making facilities.(having said that, there is absolutely no room to fit these into the room that we are in. my head is roughly 2m from the TV and 2m from the entry door).
6. Majority of the staff have been quite surly. We have not been unpleasant towards them - i agree with another of the reviewers that we are all equal. We did ask if we could change rooms due to the noise in the hallways and due to the fact that we had requested a corner room but did not receive one. Everyone seems to slam their doors at all hours of the night - why does no one think of how that affects other people around them?? We were given a short answer of no, there is nothing available. We have only been back to the front desk once since then to change some money. Even this simple request seemed to be an infringement on their important time. No smile at all or even a pleasant greeting. It does seem like they are receiving quite a few complaints at the moment. I suspect this is their busiest time of year but there is certainly no christmas cheer in the atmosphere.
My sister flys into NY in a few days. It will be interesting to see what room she receives. I can only guess from reading other reviews that the rooms are completely hit and miss. You may receive one that is large or small, with or without views, renovated / unrenovated, shower that works / doesnt work, fridge/ no fridge etc.
7. This is not a 4* hotel. We have stayed in everything from 2 - 5 star hotels all over the world. We consider ourselves polite, well seasoned travellers.
The good
1. it is in a good location
2. the price is fairly reasonable
3. the beds are comfortable enough to get a good nights sleep
4. The rooms are clean and the housekeeping does a good job.
5. Ticktock diner is located at the bottom of the hotel and is open 365 days a year 24hrs a day. It serves a variety of basic, reasonably priced meals for when you dont feel like going out into the city.
Overall, I'm not sure if we would stay here again. Maybe we would get a better room/ better service if we had travelled at a different time of year?",JezandCarls,2011-12-01,122005,2011-12-27,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Enjoyed it Very Much” My sister and I stayed at The New Yorker for several nights. We were assigned here from an auction with Hotwire. 
This is such an iconic hotel!
It was a wonderful experience! The beds and linens were very nice and extremely comfortable. Nice and quiet on our floor. 
The Heat worked great when we wanted it to. Nice black out curtains that were very attractive too! 
Yes, bathroom was small, but very functional & fun - I like updated authentic.
The lobby has such a positive energy to it! Always people coming and going. Upbeat atmosphere. There are plenty of staff near the elevators to answer questions. 
I love the fact that there's a baby grand piano in the lobby. One night two woman sat down and played a beautiful duet for everyone to enjoy. Terrific. 
The TIC TOC diner right connected to the lobby was a lifesaver. What a bonus - good food and good service.

Bathroom was small and a bit dated but fine and has a hair dryer. security is spot on even checking for your room card before getting into lift. All staff and cleaners were pleasant and professional. I have recommended this hotel to others who have now booked it and would stay here again without a doubt!

"“4 to a room is 2 too Many” Me and some people I work with had a chance to visit New York City for 3 days in November, we didn't find out until the last minute so our hotel end up being a lot more then it would have been if we booked earlier (not the hotels fault, book early when you can and save some cash). 
We booked a room for 4 adults. The room was too small for 4 people. The beds were definitly too small for 2 people each (unless you like to snuggle!) the bathroom was tiny with no counter space. 
HOWEVER the New Yorker Hotel was located right down the street from Penn Station and everything was so close by that we hardly spent any time at the hotel anyways. 
This hotel is older but has been renevated. The sizing of the rooms has been that way for a long time (people weren't as picky back in the day). 
The hotel also had good security, they check to make sure you are actully a hotel guest before you go into the elevator. 
Also the consier (not sure how to spell it) was very friendly and even better HONEST, she told me when I could get tickets cheaper somewhere else. She also gave me a great map of the city which had subway routes so we didn't once get lost or take the wrong subway (this may just have been by shere dumb luck though).
All and all the New Yorker was a great hotel, very convinenly located.

"“A beautiful historic hotel” I was pleasantly surprised with the New Yorker Hotel as I had read mixed reviews. Front desk staffs were great and very accommodating, and the Bell-Desk personnel were friendly. Overall, the group that greeted us made our arrival very pleasant and set the tone for great things that followed.
Although a lot of renovations and upgrades have been made, the hotel still has a historic feel to it, which makes it that much more welcoming. However, be prepared to spend time in ""smaller-than-usual"" hotel rooms.
The room cleanliness could certainly be better (I found an old plastic wine cup in our room, which looked like it was left there for years); however, the housekeeping was very responsive when we asked for extra attention.
If nothing else, the location of the hotel beats most other hotels: Conveniently located near a subway station, only a block away from Macy's and the shopping district, great restaurants around and a beautiful view of the city (we were on the 37th floor, with a fantastic view of the Chrysler and the Empire State Buildings).

"“2 stars would be a stretch” We encountered one sullen front desk staff named Ana during check in, though the rest of the staff seem friendly. Extremely cramped, small room with seriously outdated furniture. When I booked the room, Expedia clearly indicated that it would be a renovated queen room, but there was nothing remotely resembling renovation anywhere in the room. I just don't see how anyone can, in reasonable conscience, assign a 4 star rating to this miserable, mediocre place. The Tick Tock Diner was every bit as miserable - the hostess directed us to a table in the corner where the waiting staff were banging away in the very next table replenishing ketchup, salt, sugar containers. Of course we moved to another table, over the objection of our surly waiter, very quickly. This is truly a miserable establishment - avoid at all cost.",Kin_DCWashingtonDC,2011-12-01,122005,2011-12-24,False,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Perfect Hotel Base for Exploring New York!” We stayed at the New Yorker from 18th-22nd December and we had room 2535. I was a little apprehensive because of some negative reviews, but I have to say I was absolutely delighted with the service we received at the New Yorker. The staff from the reception staff, to the tick tock diner to the cleaners and bellboy staff were all extremely courteous and friendly and also efficient.
Firstly, check in was quick, friendly and as it was a birthday trip - we emailed ahead and the lovely lady on reception upgraded us to a view room. We had an amazing view of the ESB and MSG. The room itself was spacious and more than enough room for us, the bathroom was a little dated yes, but it was fully functional and more than adequate for what we needed! Shower was hot and powerful - something that can be lacking in hotels.
The room had a flat screen tv, very comfortable bed and plenty of storage space and desk area. The only thing that was missing was tea/coffee making facilities you may be used to in the UK. Also, one niggle was that the noise from the neighbouring bedrooms bathrooms was loud, but it was just a minor niggle. Considering we were in the middle of New York we slept soundly each night which was great considering the busy days we planned for ourselves!
The location of the hotel was perfect, right next to 34 Penn Station which connects to the A,C,E trains and just one block from the 1,2 and 3 lines. I would highly recommend using the subway to get around. We did walk quite some way but the subway was extremely useful and we used it to get back to JFK when we left.
The Tick Tock diner, and Coopers Tavern are great assets to the hotel and if you don't fancy them there is a Wendys, Burger King, McDonalds and TGI fridays all within 3-4 minutes walking distance.
All in all, a great hotel and I was very pleased to stay here, and would be happy to come back or recommend to friends and family! 
Thank you to all the staff at the New Yorker for helping make our trip so special.",forest2005,2011-12-01,122005,2011-12-23,False,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Poor value for money, stressful and shabby, avoid.” I have very mixed feelings about this hotel. And they are more negative than positive. As many travelers pointed out, the location is absolutely great. But so is the location of many other hotels in the area. We thought that the hotel was absolutely not worth the money we paid. 
It all started when we arrived. The lobby was full of people with loads of luggage and there was a very long line in front of the reception. Unfortunately we got the other receptionist (there were only two). The guy was rather snappy and slow. 
During our five-day stay we never had a comfortable feeling in the hotel lobby. The were always people sitting on bags and luggage laying around, almost like the main hall of Grand Central... 
Our room was rather OK. Not too small and being a corner room it had two windows and amazing views on the 8th Avenue, really great. The beds were also comfortable. But the room had a very shabby feeling about it. There was no mini-bar, no coffee/tea amenities, no safe. The colors were very bland, no style about that room (or any other room that we saw, four in total). The bathroom was a joke. I mean for a four-star hotel the bathroom was a hundred years old: cracks in the tub and the sink, very old tiles. Our toilet clogged very soon....In the morning, I asked the receptionist to take care of it, nothing done in the evening. The shower was an old tube coming out of the wall, no possibility to adjust water pressure, just an old rudimentary shower...
Breakfast was also a huge disappointment. We were given vouchers/coupons and had to eat breakfast at the Tik Tako Diner (or smth like that, entrance directly from the hotel lobby). The worst breakfast ever. We were actually looking forward to having American style breakfast, but it turned out to be a stressful experience. The place is always in a rush, staff is rude, the choice on the coupons is very limited (5 choices), no top ups for juice or water... Anything extra (read not on the coupon) is to be paid for...
The restaurant in the lobby was OK. We had diners there twice. But the service was strange, the waiter simply forgot to bring the french fries with the meat... Brought them when the plate was already empty....Not a nice experience all in all. 
The staff of the hotel deserves a special comment. Some people at the reception were super nice and very helpful, others rude and inattentive. Overall the feeling we had at the hotel was of stress and discomfort. We did not feel we stayed at a four-star hotel. Rush rush, snap snap...And, we have also discovered that floors 9 to 18 or so are actually rented out to students / families???!! It's not part of the hotel, it rather looks as a student dorm, with plenty of young children running around .... 
In conclusion: we do realize that standards of quality can differ from country to country or even continent. But to call the New Yorker a four-star hotel is a big mistake. Nothing about it feels like four-star. Except for the high prices we had to pay per room...That creates the feeling that we were rushed in and out and left a load of money behind for nothing....Never again.",ZwarteKater,2011-12-01,122005,2012-01-06,False,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.9,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Lack of service” Just got back from New Year in New York. Unfortunatly booked into the New Yorker hotel. If you want service, don't go to this hotel. On arrival in the pooring rain, we had to unload and carry our own bags into reception, only to join a line of people also waiting to check in, only two staff working. All you need after travelling for 12 hours.Eventually managed to get served, only to find that the rooms we had booked were not available, (so don't bother requesting a room with the view you want). Staff are not very helpful. On arriving at our room, we were very surprised at how small it was, (lucky we didn't bring our cat) The rooms are very tired and old fashioned, but at least the beds were clean. Really over priced though for what you get. There are no tea/coffee facilities in the room or room service, so it's a case of get up, get the lift down stairs buy a coffee from the bar outside the diner and trek up to your room again. There are also no safes in the rooms, so you have to get a safety deposit box in reception, unfortunatly every time you want something from your box, you have to line up with people who are waiting to sign in, so you can be waiting 30 minutes, just to get some money out. The hotel also has a bar/diner called Coopers, the bar is very good and staff friendly with great cocktails, the diner on the other hand, on the one occassion we ate there was terrible. The food was either undercooked or well overcooked and some we did not recieve at all. The good point about the hotel is it's position, ideally located for all sights.

"“We'll be back!” After reading the numerous reviews about this hotel prior to our visit, I was slightly worried and apprehensive about our choice of accommodation having read about poor cleaning standards, miserable staff etc. Take no notice of these reviews as our stay here was brilliant! There were 4 of us (2 couples) in the party and from arriving and checking in to departing the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. The rooms were spotless, very comfortable beds and the bathrooms too were very clean with ample towels, toiletries etc. Yes, the rooms are small but why do you need a huge room?? If like us you are visiting New York to see the sights and shop then you will literally use your room to sleep and shower any further time spent in the room then you are wasting time in getting out and about. The rooms seemed fairly newly renovated as did the bathroom, there was a flat screen TV which we used to catch weather forecasts and nothing else. The view wasn't magnificent but again why do you need to be sitting at the window when you can be out and about and the Empire State Building is minutes away if you want to see a magnificent view of the City. We had a great time in New York and we wouldn't hesitate to come back and stay at the New Yorker. It's location is fantastic, very central for getting about and if you don't want to use the Tick Tock Diner (we didn't) there is a Macdonalds across the road or a small but very nice deli a couple of minutes away where you can grab a good coffee before setting out for the day. This hotel was a very pleasant surprise for a City centre hotel, we've stayed in four star hotels in Central London which weren't a patch on the New Yorker. Yes there is a security guy as you enter to return to your room but who wants just anyone off the streets wandering in and around the hotel, this made us feel safe and something we haven't experienced before and we've stayed in some big hotels all over the USA including LA and Vegas. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I wouldn't be worrying about standards. If you are polite and nice to the staff then they will be polite etc in return, as guests we are not better than the staff who work there and sadly we witnessed folks who thought it right and proper to speak to the staff in a rude and degrading manner as if they were beneath them. If you have that kind of disrespectful attitude then you don't deserve politeness or kindness from anyone.

"“For travelers traveling by train, Excellent Location” I traveled from DC, so took the Northeast Regional to Penn Station and the New Yorker is right across the street so very convenient with no need on taking a cab or subway after departing the train. It's an older hotel so has a dated feeling to it and definitely shows up in the bathrooms. The furnishings are all updated so rooms for the most part are nice. The hotel rooms might actually be on a big size (of course for New York) due to the age of the building. I stayed in newer hotel in NYC and rooms/hallways a lot smaller. The Staff was friendily and had no issues with the hotel. The price and location is very good value for $200 or under per night. Walking distance to the Empire State Building/Macy's/Fifth Ave/Times Square/Broadway. Subway is at the corner of the building that can take you to lower Manhattan or up to Central Park.

A great little shop with reasonably priced souvenirs.

Hotel is in a great location, we arrived by train and walked 2 minutes to the hotel. We walked to all attractions due to the great location too.

"“Nice hotel, good location!” We stayed here from 15-22 December 2011 and we were happy with the value for money. Our room was ready for us when we arrived at the hotel (about 3.30pm) and we were given a room on the 37th floor. Our room was very small, only 1 queen bed (every other hotel I have stayed at in the US has had a king bed or 2 queens), I found the mattress very hard and uncomfortable but that is my only real complaint. The bathroom was clean; however, there was no extractor fan in the room so when you had a shower the whole room steamed up. Also the toilet bowl was covered in scratches which made it look dirty.
The reception staff were helpful, and we had no problem getting a safety deposit box. The reception was nice and festive and there was a man playing the piano in the lobby during the day. In the evening there was always someone at the elevators to ensure that only guests were entering the hotel which was reassuring.
We went to the Tick Tock diner one morning for breakfast and the food was good. The portions were very big so make sure you a hungry before you go. The only thing that bothered me was getting a card from the waitress at the end telling you how much you should tip!
The location is why we chose the New Yorker, it is very central and right next to Penn Station which was very handy for us as we got the train back and forward to the airport which saved us a lot of money compared to getting a taxi.",reviewEdinburgh,2011-12-01,122005,2012-01-04,False,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Over excited security guards!” My cousin and I booked into room 28 on the 29th floor on Sunday 18/9/11, having looked forward to our first visit to New York for months. Having had a long day travelling (and finding the shuttle bus from Newark airport to the hotel- which proved a challenge and took over an hour) we decided to have an early night before enjoying the sights of the city the next day...and were asleep early.
Imagine our horror at being woken up at 10.00 p.m. by a man's voice yelling from the corridor that 'Security would break down the door if we didn't open up immediately, and the fine for smoking marijuana was $250, and $500 if we denied the offence'....It took a moment for us to wake up and listen to this tirade from outside our door..so we phoned down to the hotel lobby to report this intrustion on our privacy...who confirmed it was indeed a security guard banging on our door trying to gain access to our room. It seemed best to open the door before he did indeed break down the door and frame and cause himself an injury. Imagine his surprise to be confronted by two 60 ish English ladies in their Marks & Spencer dressing gowns, looking more than a little bemused at the allegations being made that it was a federal offence for marijuana to be smoked in the room!!!!!- we were beyond words, not sure what was worse, being accused of smoking illegal substances or being woken up from a deep sleep-however, he was not to be daunted....he was determined to see his excitement of a possible 'drug bust' through. It seemed that the 'marijuana alarm' (whatever and wherever that is in the hotel) had gone off showing our room to be a den of pot smoke...and he claimed 'the whole of the 29th floor had complained of the smell of marijuana coming from our room'..at this point I tentatively peered over the shoulder of the second security guard to see if there were hoards of irate residents waiting to see us dragged out of the room....but no-one in sight....now at this point, someone should have put on the brakes, calmed down and assessed the situation, but no, it was obvious we were not be be afforded any courtesy, he insisted on looking in our toilet!!!- now why would we try to stop him....obviously the hotel was not going to give us any privacy and there was to be no thought for our feelings of bewilderment and almost fear at the hands of this overwraught security man....and at this second point in time, having inspected the toilet (!) it would have allayed our fears of being at the mercy of this excitable man if he had apologised for waking us up, apologised for putting the fear of god into us, confirmed that maybe his 'marijuana alarm' was wrong and needed repair...but no......he stormed out of the room and left us wondering what sort of hotel we were staying in. Next morning we waited for some sort of explanation....maybe a phone call to apologise, maybe flowers in our room, maybe complementary meal vouchers in the TickTock diner...but no....absolutely nothing, just an icy stare from the security guard as we walked passed him to the lift.....luckily we found the city of New York friendly and ameniable when we were out and about, but we lived with the fear of another raid before our departure the following day....so I do hope you are not booked into room 28 on the 29th floor....!",sally b,2011-09-01,122005,2011-09-28,False,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent Pick” This hotel is perfect for a New York stay. It is my second time to New York and each visit to this hotel only makes me like it more. It is right across the street from Penn Station, has a connecting diner, and a Starbucks right across the street. The hotel service is awesome, 4 star, service. The hotel is well kept, clean, and attentive to needs and requests. Both times I stayed I requested picture perfect views and that is what I got. They are very accommodating and polite. The cost is very good for New York and you won’t find the same quality anywhere else for the price. I highly recommend the hotel. 
On our departure date we had a bill slipped under our door for the total cost of our stay. It was much less than I was expecting based on the quote given at check-in; so as you can imagine I was happy to see the discounted room rate. However, when I checked my credit card bill the charges met my original expectations (not discounted :-( ). When I got the online request to give the hotel feedback I mentioned this incorrect bill thing had happened and within a few days received a follow-up call apologizing and assuring me they would work on this glitch to make sure it doesn’t happen in the future. I appreciated the personal follow-up call considering it was nothing major that really required such attention.

"“Lipstick on a Pig” This place is a dump and the title says it all. The carpets are disgusting, the bathrooms haven't been remodeled - they basically replaced outdated tile with outdated tile and cut corners left and right to make the place look presentable. The staff made no effort to be friendly or make us feel comfortable. I had to stay at the New Yorker because my company got a block of rooms at a good price - shocker.
If you have a choice, don't stay here. If you are unfortunate enough to book a room here, keep everything off the floor and furniture. I stored everything I could on hangars in the closet. It's definitely one of the most disgusting hotels I stayed at in NY in this price range.",ChiTraveler_11,2011-09-01,122005,2011-09-27,False,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Location, Reasonably Priced” The main thing about the hotel is its location, it is quite central in New York so it is fairly easy to travel to most of the attractions. Its close to the Empire State Building, Macy's and Madison Square Gardens (recommend going to see the Knicks) and also about 20 minutes walking distance to Times Square and Broadway. The hotel itself is fine and reasonably priced, we had a standard room which seemed fairly clean although rooms were a little small and we didn't have a view but when you're in New York all you need is a base. We didn't eat in the bar as we wanted to explore different restaurants around the city, recommend the diner in brooklyn near the bridge and Buba Gump's Shrimp comany at Times Square!

“Great location and friendly staff” This hotel is fantastic value for money and in a great location. Madison square gardens is just over the road and therefore brilliant if you fancy watching the knicks or rangers which i would definitely reend! All of the main sights are only ten minutes away. The staff are incredibly helpful and cannot do enough for you.the rooms are small but newly renovated - lets face it how long are you going to spend in a hotel room in the Big Apple?!

"“Right Location, wrong Hotel!” Upon arrival it looks fabulous, location is brilliant check in was rubbish, customer service course obviously not undertaken, not at all helpful. We wern't ""shown"" to our rooms even though a bell boy service is available, we had to ask where the lifts are, the room was very clean & smelling nice, although very small, enough space for a bed & to walk around, en-suite bathroom a little dated although again very clean.
We decided to see a show & went through the conceirge at the hotel, we were offered 2 tickets at a really good price which we purchased, the conceirge stated these were the last 2 available & we had to pick them up before 18:00hrs, which we went down at 17:55hrs to do & was told they hadn't arrived, however the conceirge gave us an address to go & pick them up, which i refused to do & asked for a refund, she became sort of unhelpful stating she would wait longer but pointed out many times she would miss her train & not see her kids trying to make us feel gulity, however they did turn up 15 mins later she was still pointing out the guilt trip to us. There is no safe in the room however they gave us a drawer safe in there safe free of charge. I recommend the Tick tock cafe which is linked to the hotel for breakfast, very helpful & portions are amazing, copius amounts of coffee for the price of 1, Coopers Bar is also a great place for a meal or a drink, however if your just drinking alcohol watch your bill, we drank Bailey's & guiness which varied from $14 - $18 each round! The room was cleaned everyday & nothing was too much to ask for from the housekeepers.
Check out was simple, although when we asked for a receipt we wern't told on check in they take $250 off your credit card for a damages bond!
I recommend going to see the guys in the Yellow Jackets near the empire state for sightseeing tours, we got the tour bus for 5 days, hop on & off, Rockafella centre, Empire state building, statue of liberty, Ellis Island & 90min cruise around New york all for $216 for 2 of us!!!

"“Good value” We found the New Yorker to be good value and conveniently located in mid-town. The building dates back to the 1920s and has plenty of period character. I must say that the sash windows made a nice alternative to the air conditioning on the cooler days that we were in NYC. The rooms were compact, but the beds were comfortable. I did find that the noise from slamming doors in the corridor interrupted my sleep a little. Given the small size of the room, there was no escaping how close you are to the hallway! The bathroom looked in need of some updating, but it was clean and had everything we needed. All in all, we were happy with our decision to stay at the New Yorker.
The hotel is located right next to a subway station and you shouldn't have any difficulties hailing a cab in the area. Times Square and Empire State are within easy walking distance, plus Madison Square Garden and the shops on 34th Street are just a stones throw away. As with any big city, you should keep your wits about you when walking around, especially if you cut through the side streets near the hotel, where we saw some shady looking characters. No-one bothered us though.
The Tick-Tock diner attached to the hotel (open 24 hours) was good for breakfast, but it gets busy during peak times. Don't bother going there for dinner however, we found the food to be a little disappointing, which is a shame as we enjoyed the breakfast. For a really good breakfast, visit the Brooklyn Diner on 57th Street (between 7th and 8th), then take a walk in the park to burn it off!

The room was spacious, clean and the beds ever soooo comfortable. 
Breakfast's at the Tik Tok Diner are a must. Great Irish Bar called Tir Na Nog only a block away.

"“A great hotel in a fantastic location” The hotel was clean, the rooms were a good size and the staff were friendly. The hotel was also very accomodating about having a camper bed in the room (in addition to the two doubles already in there) so that we did not have to share a double bed (I was travelling with two other guys). There was however a $25 charge a night for this.
Even more importantly the location was great. Being next to Penn station meant it was always so easy to navigate our journeys either to or from the hotel. 
My only criticsm of the hotel was that on the booking receipt confirmation it should give a bit more info about the taxes one is going to incur rather than just giving the not including tax price as it seems that in NYC hotels there are lots of different taxes (standard, occupancy) which can be a bit confusing to the average tourist.
In conclusion, a great hotel in a fantastic location.

"“Great location hotel” We visited New York for the 1st time over New year. The hotel proved to be in a fantastic location for the Empire state building, Times Square and the Rockefeller. When we arrived at the hotel we were downgraded from the 32nd to 22nd floor with a very drafty room. The room was a little old fashioned but we were not in the room much. The tap also came off when running a bath which was quickly resolved. As creatures of habit, we loved the Skylight diner on 9th Avenue which offered excellent breakfasts at great prices before 10am. A further recommendation was the Houndstooth pub on 8th avenue for good food and atmosphere. What we really want to thank the hotel for is the limousine service we received when leaving the hotel to catch our flight. We were saved by the quick thinking of the limo driver from the Ivory coast who got us to the right gate and the right time due to traffic and black ice for the same price as a cab.",Joaniesjunk,2012-01-01,122005,2012-01-14,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Certainly consider an upgrade!!” Myself and girlfriend spent Xmas 2011 in New York. We stayed at the New Yorker for 4 nights and certainly wasn't disappointed with the location. Great central location for all of the main NYC tourist attractions. The New Yorker had a quirky art-deco style that looked great and on arrival I was not disappointed. Our first room however was tiny (couldn't swing a cat tiny!) and the bathroom wasn't in great condition. As it was a holiday of a lifetime, we decided within 2 minutes of being in the room to upgrade. A cost of $80 per night, so not cheap, but it was worth it. An amazing view of the city(not a brick wall view we originally had). I know you don't go to NYC to sit in a nice hotel room all day but after 6-7 hours of walking(+ 1 day of torrential rain all day) we were glad to have somewhere cosy to come back to(and dry our clothes!).

Free wifi in rooms, bedrooms were small as other have commented but seriously, who goes to NY to spend time in their room?! Our room had been recently redecorated where the bathroom was more old fashioned, think it was the original but it worked & was clean!

"“Not quite what I expected for the price paid.” The location of this hotel is great. We (party of four) flew from Belfast to Newark Liberty airport. We travelled from Newark to Penn Station via train and thankfully the hotel was just three minutes walk from the train station. It is central to most of the main attractions. The Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square, Broadway Theatre Land are all within walking distance.
On arrival check in was swift and trouble free. Our rooms were ready, one on the 36th floor and the other on the 37th. The foyer to the hotel is impressive, lots of room and stylish (art deco). The reception staff were quite friendly and helpful.
The rooms were not of a bad size, we had two double beds in each which was more than ample. They were very clean and free from smells which was welcome. Our room had a view of the Empire State Building, which at night was spectacular when it was light up with red, white and blue lights.
The bathroom was a disappointment. Very small, with a shower over the bath and a PVC shower curtain which allowed lots of water to spray unto the bathroom floor, making it quite slippy. Our sink was suffering from a slight blockage which resulted in a slow drainage flow. This was reported but no action was taken during the six days of our stay. There was also a lot of mould around the floor level corners of the bathroom, which I did not expect in a hotel of this stature.
Another disappointment was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Coming from Northern Ireland we expect this facility in hotels. In fact I don't know of a hotel or guest house in Ulster where this would not be available.
The purpose of our visit to New York was to play bagpipes at the closing ceremony of the World Police and Fire Games. On the Saturday we approached one of the managers, a blonde female, and asked if there was a room somewhere we could play for approximately one hour. The hotel electronic notice board indicated there were no functions taking place that day, so we thought there would not be a problem. We were met with a firm ""no, we cannot help you."" When we pointed out there did not seem to be any functions on the manager still could not accommodate us. We were surprised and again disappointed at this response. As a band we have stayed in a number of hotels and have always been accommodated for a request such as this, even when our full band comprising over 20 members have been present, on this occasion there were only four of us.
Had it not been for the lack of tea/coffee facilities, mould in the bathroom and the unaccommodating attitude of the manager I wold have given this hotel a higher rating.

"“Always a great place” In the past year I've had the opportunity to stay at the New Yorker on several repeat trips . We had a couple of great rooms that stood out from the average room too for the same rate . No problems with any room other than one needed a few touchups and had a slow sink. That was the worst thing I can say . The location is ideal for getting around Manhattan . Penn Station , Macys , Post Office , Fashion District all close by and the walk to Broadway is easily done. One night when other family was busy I walked there and back in about 40 minutes to grab an item I saw in a shop earlier.
The staff at the front desk of the New Yorker is excellent ,so willing to help and the restaurants are both fine even though quite different in decor.
 We dined at the Tic Tock many times over the trips and Coopers a couple times when we wanted some atmosphere . Never an issue , and the smiling staff members made our day.
Our rooms have always been clean and neat , well decorated . Housekeeping superb , never saw a bug , people aways cleaning during the day . It clearly shows they care .
My daughter lived there for part of her schooling and it gave my wife a secure feeling because the staff was so helpful. 
The place has chram and character . Love the history of the place too.

"“Big hotel small rooms! Rude security” This hotel Is Huge But The rooms are EXTREMELY SMALL and unconfortable when I was trying to seat at the desk I almost dont have space to open the chair since the bed is right behind. 
ALL DAY AND NIGHT security is at ELEVATOR like if you were getting inside a night club and if u have a visitor it's a hassle  to let him go up to your room.
I didn't like that hotel at all it's a boring old hotel where u won't be treated kindly, Probably you might need to WAIT IN LINE untill the security check you keycard at elevator, every single time make sure you have your keycard out in your hads while getting inside the elevator: so they know you are a guess and not going to steal the expensive decoration and art they have inside the hallways. Ah! something good, they have a nice Gym and a room to do your laundry right beside the gym.

"“Best Location ever!” The hotel is in need of a little TLC but apart from that its fab and even if it's not renovated next time I go to New York, I will definitely stay here. 
The location is amazing. I've been to NYC 4 times now for leisure trips and this is just the perfect place. The metro station runs under the hotel with the station entrance right outside the door and this line runs to JFK International Airport. You do have to make a change but it's very easy. It cost something like $6 per person to get to JFK rather than spending $80 on a cab. The hotel is right next to Madison Square Garden and less than 10 minutes to the Empire State BUilding, Times Square and you can go South to the trendy spots for nights and meals out.",Pinksian,2011-02-01,122005,2012-01-12,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Fantastic stay” Just returned from my 1st visit to New York and totally loved it. Chose the New Yorker as it was reasonably priced and the location was spot on for a first timer. Its on the corner of 8th Avenue and 34th Street so is in a really good cental location. Macy's is 1 block away and Empire State Building is close too. Id booked a view room with 2 double beds. Basically the view room is a room with either a view of Empire State Building or Hudson River. I was hoping for the Empire view but our room, 3142 on the 31st floor, was the Hudson River side. If i was staying here again i would bother with the view to be honest. Room was lovely, 2 double beds which was very comfy. 2 built in wardrobes, a flat screen HD TV, a desk, plenty of cupboard space, windows the actually open so we could have some proper air in the room when it got stuffy. Also room has air con & heating if you need it. Bathroom was small though which was a surprise as the room was a decent size. Room was cleaned every day by the very friendly chamber maids. Leave them a tip when you leave as they work really hard and always had a smile and a hello for you.
Room has no safe, these are in the hotel lobby. Also no kettle or coffee maker in room. 
All in all it was a really nice hotel, plenty of elevators to the floors, security so non residents cant get in.
My only gripe was when i booked they was some confusion with the rate i was given and i was promised breakfast in the next door Tick Tock diner which is accessed from the hotel lobby for my inconvenience. I was given vouchers for this when i checked in but the 1st morning i went to the diner and the voucher wasnt for complimentary breakfast, it was just 5 dollars off so i was a bit disappointed with that but it didnt spoil my stay at the hotel at all. Hotel was everything i needed for a 1st visit. Location & room excellent.
New York itself was amazing!!!!",fastdaz,2011-09-01,122005,2011-09-22,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“fantastic location, great service” I went to New York for my birthday with one of my female friends, I was coming from Australia, she was coming from Malaysia. I had booked the room and it was great that the hotel accepted that she would check in before me (send them and her an email saying that she would be arriving early) - service was great. The hotel is located at teh corner of 41st St and 8th Avenue, 8th Avenue is a little dodgy, but 41st Street is fantastic. The hotel is about 3 blocks from Macy's and about 5/6 blocks from the Empire State building. We both felt really safe with the location and went out most nights. We were always able to get a taxi immediately from in front of the hotel. The beds were comfortable, the room was cleaned daily and we found the service from the hotel great, they gave advice on things to see etc. Also because it's such a big hotel reception is open 24 hours and as far as security goes, you are asked to show you're room key when going back into the hotel.

"“Location Location” Was in New York for work and stayed at The New Yorker Hotel which is a very central location and easy access to 'The Penn' train station and within easy walking distance of the Fashion district. The rooms are small, but clean and are in an 'art deco' style. Housekeeping was very good. In terms of location it was very good value for money. There is a 24 hr diner downstairs that serves American food which is handy if you have to eat and run. Staff are friendly and helpful and they have security in the foyer ensuring only guests access the lifts to the rooms. On check out they have a bag holding service but expect to pay $2 per bag ($1 on leaving your bag and $1 on collecting them).

"“Great first experience” I have just returned from a five night stay at the New Yorker. It was my first time in NYC and I was very happy with the hotel. Great location arrived via JFK and thanks to advice from a local caught the air train to Jamaica and then the Long Island Railroad to Penn station, less than an hour and cost $13. Short walk to the hotel. Staff were very friendly and the room was clean and ample as it was only a place to sleep and change. We had two doubles in our room and a view of the empire state building. When we arrived in the room we were informed by staff to call housekeeping and they would bring us a coffee machine free of charge. Which was quick and easy to use.
We had breafast most mornings at the Tick Tock Diner and the food was good average price $10. 
Very central location and we walked everywhere.
I would definitely return to this hotel, no bed bugs for me. Very comfortable bed and pillows to die for...

"“Amazing stay” I had a really good time here. It was clean and the room was large with two double beds. The beds and the pillows were so comfortable. The cleaners were fantastic, cleaned the room every day and were really nice. The tick tock diner attached to the hotel let the hotel down a bit, but you're so close to everything else it doesnt matter. Fantastic location, not far from times square. We walked most places. The reception staff were friendly. It sometimes got a little loud at night, but I think that was more due to the annoying screeching girl next door to us. Between us we had two rooms and both were nice and we didnt have any problems at all.

"“Great location, average hotel” We recently stayed at this hotel from 9/7 - 9/10 for our trip to New York. If you want to stay anywhere in Manhattan this is probably the best location you can get. Right off the subway lines (I believe A,C,E,1,2,3) are all within a 1 block radius since you're at one of the main hubs (Penn St). Also a block away from Madison Square Gardens if you're there for a sporting event, and a 10 minute walk to Times Square/Theater District.
However, for the amount we paid for this hotel we expect a better room than what we got. Keeping in mind that this is a 100 year old hotel in the middle of Manhattan so we expected the rooms to be quite small (which they were), there was a humid/wet feel when we were in the rooms and didn't feel that clean. The washrooms while dated had a newer sink and good water pressure. There was also a nice gym below the lobby.
If you get a good rate on this hotel it's worth a shot, but I wouldn't stay here again based on the price we had to pay - although in fairness for this review I should note out that we were there in the run up to the 10 year anniversary of 9/11 so all rooms in Manhattan were overpriced that week.",TheRanj,2011-09-01,122005,2011-09-21,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.1,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Only in New York” Stayed in the New Yorker from the 24th August until the 8th September 2011.We were in a large group we arrived and our rooms were already prealocated so no problems checking in.We were on the 20th floor in a double room as previous advisors stated room was small 12feet by 12feet bathroom was small also but both were clean and new towels/bedding replaced daily.The view was terrible, looking at a w all about 15 feet away.One good point the pillows were fantastic the best ive ever had in a Hotel.
All in all who goes to New york to stay in the room.The good thing about the hotel is there is 12 lifts on most floors so no waiting in that area.The lobby is a fantastic high ceiling area with various seats couches etc perfect area to do some people watching and lets face it New York has plenty of people to watch!
The lobby is air conditioned some days it was a bit chilly,
The Hotel doesnt do food but on the ground floor it has a 24 hour Diner called Tick Tock.
It was a good sign to see it was always busy day and night.We never had to wait any more than one minute to be seated and service was quick and courteous,If the diner was busy the waiter/waitress kept us informed.We were at the hotel during huricane Irine and it stayed open when the rest of New York closed down for 24hrs.well done!
Food was good and what ever you want from toast to a bellybuster.
I would stay in the New Yorker again as its very close to Times square and Maceys.

"“Great location to see Manhattan” Myself and three collegues spent three days at the New Yorker Hotel in midtown Manhattan this September and found the hotel to be very clean, the staff friendly and willing to assist with restaurant reservations or ideas for places to see. Most of all the hotel is in a fantastic location to see Manhattan either by subway, on foot or using the Grey Line bus. The New Yorker is a block from Macy's and if you love to shop Macy's is shopping heaven. It is also across the street from Madison Square Gardens so great for sporting events, concerts, etc. Penn station subway station is 2 minutes away by foot and Time Square a quick 15 minute walk away while the Empire State Building is 10 minutes walking distance. The hotel room pricing is in line with other midtown Manhattan hotels and if your are going to New York don't expect any great hotel room bargains.",Cammer10,2011-09-01,122005,2011-09-20,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great location, poor service” The location of the hotel is excellent. Across the road from Penn station on 8th Ave, the hotel is also close to Macy's and the Empire State, as well as a 10-15 min walk to Times Square. The rooms were small, but this is standard for New York. The bedding, etc. was basic but adequate. I had a standard queen room, which had a small LCD TV, bed, desk and one office chair. There was also free wi-fi. There is no in-room safe - a safety deposit box must be used in the lobby. The housekeeping staff were excellent, and maintained the room to a high standard. Attached to the hotel is the Tick Tock diner which was excellent value and quality food, and was open 24hrs. 
My only issue with this hotel is the service that we received. We arrived at 3pm - standard check-in - and we waited literally 25 minutes in line to check in. Once we got to the front, the clerk could not handle our reservation I had made through booking.com. I had booked two rooms with two names on one reservation, but she could only find one room. First she had asked my friend to go to the back of the line because she would only check-in one room per person (putting my friend another 10 people behind), but she eventually agreed to do her check-in with mine. 10 minutes later I worked out what the problem was with my reservation - she had not read the whole email was looking for the reservation under the wrong name. That was sorted out, but the whole process took about half an hour, which is unacceptable, and we recieved no apology. It appeared however that they were having difficulties with other reservations as well. I don't know how a process that takes 5 minutes in every other hotel can possibly take 30 in another. The queue was the same size every day between about noon until 5pm. 
Your room key is checked to access the elevators to the room levels. This is fine, if it is done consistently. But I walked passed them so many times during that week having a good chat amongst themselves, or staring at the ceiling, or leaving the gate unattended. It really irritated me that they asked to see my key when I had only stepped into the lobby for literally 2 minutes, and my hands were full. If they were doing the process correctly, they should have noticed me exit two minutes prior, or recognised me from the other five days that I had stayed there. Also, my friend passed the guard by showing him his bank card and not his key, so it was all a bit pointless. The front desk was inconsistent in their service, doing some things for my friend's room, but refusing to do it for my account and vice versa. They were 'unable' to provide me with a printout of charges before my final night, but could do it for my friend.

"“Great place; great value too.” After delayed flights and missing a train and rolling into New York at about 2 a.m., we stumbled out of Penn Station, bleary-eyed and wondering where our hotel was. Turns out, it was just a block and a half away, and we were greeted by friendly folks who were nattily dressed. The room itself had a great view of the river. It was on the small side, but who cares, you're not in New York to stay in your room! The Tick Tock Diner adjacent to the hotel is great food and there was a serviceable bar on the other side of the building. You're within walking distance of Times Square, Chelsea, even the High Line. Also, tons of subway stations and great restaurants all around.

"“Wonderful Hotel” I was arriving in New York by train, and wanted a hotel close to Penn Station. The New Yorker is one block away, and it is a truly great hotel. It was busy when I arrived, but I was rapidly checked in by a very friendly, very professional desk clerk. 
I was assigned Room 4003 on the 40th floor, and it is no exaggeration to say this was the greatest hoel room I have ever stayed in. Room 4003 had views of the Hudson River to the west, and views of downtown New York to the south. It was amazing.
I had a refrigerator and a sink area, and the living room had two chairs, a sofa, and a desk with chair. The televsion was a 33 inch flat screen. The sofa made into a bed, and there was an additional coset in the living area. You go through double doors to the bedroom, and I am a stickler for a comfortable bed, and the bed was wonderful. The thread count in the sheets and linen were high. 
The bathroom was small, but it made up for it with a large shelf above the toilet and sink. The towels were very thick.
The location is great. You are across the street from Penn Station and the subway, and Times Square, Chelsea, the Theatre District, Macy's, the Empire State Building are short walks away.

"“Good value for the price; uncomfortable beds” I got a corner standard room, and BOY was it tiny, but was OK for my stay. Old building and rooms but updated decor and new carpet. I have to say though the BED was TERRIBLE - very hard and I have not slept well here at all. So much so I am leaving early to change to another hotel. Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper as you'll hear doors slamming shut, etc. in the hall all night. It's an older place so that's expected.
They have FREE wifi but it sucks so I paid $10 more a day for the ""high speed"" one, which sucked just a bit less. It was hard for me to do business here in my room as I have to pull up websites quickly when on calls and was just taking forever.
Staff was notably friendly--everyone from front desk to bellmen to housekeepers--and all services were up to par. I was here for the 9-11 anniversary so the mood was a bit somber on Sunday but security was high, which was good. GREAT fitness center, which was unexpected. Cute gift shop on bottom level, and I saw a big laundry room down there too, which I didn't even know was there--may have used it as I'm on a long trip.
And I loved Cooper's Tavern downstairs - ate dinner there most every night. I'm on business alone, so was nice to sit in the window and get some work done with a glass of wine and a steak. The tuna amalfi salad was great too. Ask for Carina to wait on you, she was very nice.
Good location for this area, but it's a little crazy for me. Great for tourists, but I prefer SoHo or a more funky/artsy residential area.
One weird thing that happened, one night at 3am some crazy guy was trying to bang down all the doors on our floor-- I peeked out my peephole and he was in his underwear! He must have been on drugs or mentally ill. I called security and they were up within 2 minutes and escorted him away. I asked about him the next day downstairs and--not making this up--the security guy said ""Yes he's been here before. We handed him over to the authorities."" How does this guy get in?

The experience at the New Yorker was fantastic. At check in the agent gave me a super room overlooking Empire State, Madison sq Garden, and looking towards downtown.
The room was huge with a separate sitting room / tv/ sink & fridge area, and a separate bedroom. My only tiny complaint would be the bathroom which was a little small and worn vs the standard of the rest of the room. The shower was also of poor quality and showing its age.

"“I so want to go back” I loved this hotel so much it was everything I wanted it to be. My brother and his girls were given a fabulous room with a view and I had a single room with a queen sized bed which I loved. The climate control is perfect and I always felt very comfortable never too cold. I slept the best nights sleep ever for the 5 nights we were there. I would love to know what sort of mattress was on the bed and I forgot to look, but I barely moved all night and I slept so soundly, it was just fantastic. We had the best holiday ever and this hotel is ideally placed. Just a short walk to the Empire State Building and virtually next door to Macys. We ate breakfast in the Tic Tock diner and were served by Mike every morning, who incidentally, could remember our drinks and brought coffee and orange juice straight over, he worked so hard and was always pleasant, it was just lovely. I'm saving up already to go back again next year. I can't stop thinking about the fabulous holiday that we had and the wonderful time we had at the New Yorker Hotel.

"“The Best hotel ever!!!!” My husband and I first trip to New York and we booked this holiday via expedia really good as it was recommend by them. I obviously checked reviews by trip advisor seemed pretty good. I am the most fussy person when it comes to hotels, anyways we checked in very tired because of the flight ( KLM best service ) our room toilet door did not shut at all and a musky smell was in the air. We were sooo tired we waited until the morning and explain everything to the hotel reception. She was so nice service with a smile is important to me and I could not fault her nor any of the staff very helpful and friendly. There is no in room safe which a lot of hotels do not have at New York but it's very easy and the staff are very helpful. Cleaners are very welcoming too. I personally would not rate tick tock dinner as there is an amazing take away foot steps away from the hotel (when u walk out of the hotels it to ur left) and starbucks and mcdonalds are opposite the hotel too. Brilliant location too every things was just 10 mins away from each other time square was 10 mins macys literally down the road.

"“Fab location, hotel is ok” Booked a 1 night stay for last week. There were 2 adults & 2 children so booked a room with 2 double beds, and did'nt pay the extra for a view room as we did not see the point.
Arrived at 9.30am room not ready which we didn't expect it to be anyway so left our bags. Had to pay $3 for leaving them and then they charge you $3 for when you go pick them up !!
Arrived back at hotel at 6.00pm and found they had upgraded us to a 1 bedroom suite on the 34th floor. The view is amazing (empire state building) however the room although large and clean is very basic - no wow factor and I certainly would not have paid the published rate for it which is in excess of $320. There is a big bedroom with 2 double beds, hallway, separate lounge with sofa, the bathroom is off the lounge (small but very clean) and a big spacious closet.
Location is fantastic. We walked everywhere. There is a bus (M10) which takes you down to Battery Park for the Staten Island Ferry. It's stop is just round the corner and it only cost us $2.25 each to get all the way down there. Takes about 40 minutes and you get to see the city.
Subway right next door too (we did not use this though).
Free wi-fi, slow but fine.
We dined for breakfast in the Tick Tock Diner next door. Ample portions and reasonably priced. Lots of places to eat out.
After checking out the following day again we left our luggage and paid again the $3 for leaving it, and $3 to collect later that day. If you want to leave valuables, they have safety deposit boxes, bear in mind they only fit small items (wallets, passports, phones etc) My ipad did not fit so just left it in my luggage.
Whilst in the City, Washington had the earthquake and we felt the tremors in NY !
Would we stay again - probably.",bluebell101,2011-08-01,122005,2011-08-31,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location, Average hotel.” As far as location goes, you can't do much better than 34th and 8th. It's right near Penn Station, Macy's, MSG and a short walk to Times Square. There is plenty to see and do 24/7 right in the neighborhood. The downside to the location is that the New Yorker is in a very congested area of the city, so even on the 21st floor we were subjected to plenty of street noise (ambulances, car horns, etc). The building has a very interesting history. It was once one of the city's largest and grandest hotels. It fell into disrepair and was eventually closed down. The Unification Church (made famous by Rev. Moon in the 1970s and 80s) purchased the building to house its followers. The building was eventually turned into a hotel again, though it's technically still owned by church. The hotel itself was ok. We had a standard room with a bed, a desk and a flat-screen TV. Like most NYC hotel rooms, it was quite small and the walls are paper thin. It's not exactly the quietest hotel I've stayed in, but then again, nobody goes to NYC for peace and quiet. The room was clean and comfortable and neither of us left with any bug bites. It's an old building with old plumbing, so it took a few minutes to get a hot shower going. My biggest complaint was lack of an i-room coffee maker. Any hotel that doesn't have that loses points in my book.

"“Ideal location and good hotel!” The New Yorker was reasonably priced and in a perfect location. Just next to Penn Station and close to The Empire State Building and Mid Town. 
The first room we were given was really quite small, and although I expected that of NYC I called reception to ask if there was a bigger room and they moved us straight away, into a much bigger room which was perfect. Nice view of NYC and very spacious. Very clean room and bathroom, everything we needed. The hotel is big and has a gym and a bar, a restaurant and also a 24 hour diner called Tick Tock. We ate here a few times as it was very convenient and the food and service was good. You can also buy pastries and coffee and tea in the reception area which is handy. 
We were very happy with the hotel and would definitely recommend it! We would stay here again if visiting NYC.",Jen&Keith,2011-08-01,122005,2011-08-29,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“It is not a hotel, but a lodging factory...” I know it is a huge hotel in a prime location, but still, how impersonal can it be?
You have to ""fight"" for everything in this hotel. Our order was supposed to include breakfast. We have got it only after requesting, and consulting with the manager. The weekdays breakfast is served by the hotel on the 39th floor. However, on weekends, the downstairs diner takes the part, and we were supposed to get vouchers for it. Despite the fact that we paid for a suite for 4, we were given only 2 vouchers per morning and had to pay for the children - ""hotel policy"".
Waited for the suitcases to arrive to the room for half an hour. After nobody answered our phone calls at the concierge's, went to look for them in person. Although specifically told, the bellboys did not know the room number, and did not seem to be bothered about that...
The lobby is always packed with people, difficult to find a seat if you have to wait for somebody.
You have to pay for leaving the suitcases in the hotel after checkout.
Finally, at the checkout I was never offered a bill. At home discovered an overcharge of about $10. Had to request the bill from the hotel by e-mail. Though the room rate seems to be correct, the taxes were not as advertised. 
Now, on the bright side:
We have got a great renovated suite on the 40th (top) floor with a magnificent view to the Empire State building. Though we paid over $300 a night, it seems to be a great deal for the NYC, considering the location and room size.
The room was reasonably clean. The shower stream could be stronger. Beds not too comfortable, pillows OK. Efficient air conditioning (both cooling and heating), and we could also open windows (a bit). The free Internet was slow, but still reasonable.
The bottom line:
Though we did not feel comfortable in this hotel, it still seems to be a very cost-effective solution.",G9508,2011-08-01,122005,2011-08-27,False,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“4 Stars ? NO WAY!” I will start with the pros: location, cleanness and low speed wifi for free and the cons: no way this is a 4 star, at least if you are from Europe you should not be able to guess this is anywhere near a 4 star; the room was very small and the bathroom very basic and old; no mini bar and if your sleep is light get ready to wake up each time someone slams a door in the corridor since walls are not thick and due to the size of the room you are basically sleeping in the corridor; expect to pay for leaving your luggage in the hotel after check out; hi speed wifi for a fee and USD 0.25/minute with a credit card in the business centre; the hotel is old-looking as a whole. One thing I have to specify to the ""credit"" of the hotel is that we got this room through Expedia's ""blind room"" system for a low price of USD 193 and there is a high probability they keep the worst rooms for that Expedia option... nevertheless that is not the best way to impress customers.",Lousybreaks,2011-08-01,122005,2011-08-26,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Fantastic Hotel we would stay again” This hotel is very central to most sights in the City. Most of the buildings in New York are Art Deco and this one was no exception, it truly was lovely, a hugh chandlier in the lobby, marble flooring, staff were very helpful, it has a feel of the 1930's, decorated to a very high standard. Dress was casual, nothing formal. 
As this was a surprise present for my 50th my husband had booked a room on the 39th floor, which meant we had a sitting room next to the bedroom, which was lovely and roomy, the photo at the top shows the room we had. The best sight of all was looking out of my bedroom window and seeing the Empire State Building, The Crysler Building, Madison Square Gardens, truly a fantastic sight night and day, especially at night, New York by night is breath taking. The breakfast room was next door to our room and had panaramic views all round, right down to lower Manhatten the Business District, the Statue of Liberty etc. 
The Subway Penn Station is next to the hotel which makes travelling much easier if you don't want to walk everywhere. Macy's is just round the corner, the biggest photographer shop B & H, biggest post office I have ever seen are both just round the block. Round the back of the hotel if you ask the bellboy, there is a lovely beautifully decorated restaurant, with excellent food at a place called Uncle Jack's, look for their offers at lunch time and especially on Sundays you will not be dissappointed.
I cannot fault this hotel in anyway, we would certainly stay there again no hesitation. Attached to the hotel is an American Diner called Tick Tock, lovely food, if you like rissottos, try the shrimp one, the flavour was outstanding, you get lots for you money, food is cheap and plentiful, better than eating out in the uk!!! For two lovely meals it cost us £9!!!
We ate here a few times as it was 24 hours, just like the city, you don't check time in New York as you can get what you want anytime!
Also attached to the hotel is another restaurant with a bar, I realised towards the end of our stay that the Tick Tock is also licensed. We didn't try this one, as we had such a full programme could not fit it in but all looked lovely and reasonably priced. Maybe we will try it when we come back next time, as we would like to do New York at Christmas time one year.
All in all you would not be disappointed if you were to book this hotel, to be fair we did have a posh room not sure what the other rooms are like, without the sitting room, I still feel there would have been enough room, besides you have come to see the City not stay in your room!!! But looking at the quality of the hotel I feel the other rooms would still be of good size. It's main attraction is location, can't beat it for that alone. Very central and if you like walking it is within reach of most sights, the further ones use the Subyway, very easy to use and if you get a 7 day Metro Card - $30 you can use it as many times as you like on the Subway, well worth the money. 
I could talk all day about New York but it wouldn't be fair, you have to find out for yourself, I found it enchanting, the smells, the sounds, busy, vibrant, noisy. The New Yorkers are the friendliest people, they love to help you, customer service is impeccable, you do have to tip for everything, they are part of their wages, to be honest tipping is pennies, but we felt every penny was worth it.
I will go now, enjoy the hotel and enjoy New York!!!! I defy you not to.",Bikerchick50,2011-08-01,122005,2011-08-25,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Location” We took the Amtrak from Washington DC and I was looking for a hotel convenient to Penn Station. This fit the bill as it is right across the street! No need for cabs when staying here. The hotel is nice, a little older, check-in was a breeze and the room was small but it was very clean and met our needs. The only complaint about the room that we had was we couldn't seem to regulate the water temperature in the shower very easily. Not a big deal to us though. The Tik Tok Diner was good and convenient and about in line as far as price with other diners in the area. This hotel is convenient to the Empire State Building, Times Square, theaters and shopping. We also walked to Central Park twice (about 1.5 miles).

"“Low Quality Room and Service and Possibly Bedbugs” In the last stop of our family trip (more than 20 days and stayed in over 15 hotels, from Hilton/Sheraton to Comfort Inn, so I can compare these hotels subjectively), we stayed at New Yorker hotel for 2 nights. I wanted to treat my parents with a comfortable stay and good service from the famous New Yorker hotel before they leave (I live locally), but the result was a huge disappointment.
Here are the key points:
pro: good location, near Penn Station and other attractions in downtown
con: 
1. extremely tiny room, bed facing the bathroom with noise and smell gone out easily
2. no lock on the door of bathroom which is just ridiculous
3. constant machine like noise from outside or upstairs (not sure of the origin) and from hallway
4. water get hot or cold suddenly in shower
5. several bedbug-like bites after the first and second night stay (after the first night I thought maybe it was not from the hotel, but after another night of sleep and new bites found, it seems very likely there were bugs in the room), not very surprising given their history of bedbug reports
6. no refrigerator in the room, no coffee machine until asked
and worst of all, the rude attitude of the front desk, they just did not care about the room quality issue and were very arrogant and indifferent, none apologies heard from them. 
I regret deeply the choice of hotel, especially given my parents did not get a good rest before their long journey. For myself, this travel experience is just a beginning, much more will come as I grow elder, I cannot and will not persuade other people about the hotel choice, but one thing is for sure, the New Yorker hotel has just lost a customer forever.",Da0_Z,2011-08-01,122005,2011-08-24,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

OK the room was on the smallish side, but we had 2 double beds (for three of us)! The bathroom was a little on the small side and slightly dated - but hey what do you do in a bathroom!!! The beds are so comfortable and the room was clean and tidy. Went to Tick Tock Diner - not that impressed. We had checked out other diners in the surrounfing area before we went and found the Starlight Diner - great food, huge portions and a really good menu.

"“great location, loved everything about it! We will be back!” After reading the reviews on trip adviser and reading about the history of hotels in New York, we choose the New Yorker Hotel as our stay for the first section of our honeymoon. The hotel was excellent from the moment we checked in. The front of House Staff knew it was our honeymoon and we were upgraded to a higher floor and given a special gift. The room it self was perfect, it had room for us and a lovely comfy bed with excellent pillows, but it was really about the view. We had a great yet side view of the New York sky line. The location was also fantastic, just a few minutes walk to Times Square and if you walk to the corner just past Tick Tocks you could look down and see the Empire State Building, fantastic especially at night. 
The room had everything you needed including a hairdryer and iron, saving you space in your luggage to shop! The hotel also has its own shop and fitness suite, we didn't use the latter so can't really review it but the shop had the basics and great souvenirs along with late opening times.The Hotel has a real New York feel to it, i can't really describe it but it is how i imagined a classy New York hotel to be, it has a great history too and for some great pictures of this hotel take the cruise around the habour at Night, the good old New Yorker has its name up in lights!
Back to the staff, excellent all very knowledgeable and helpful and there was always somebody there and they were never to busy to help you enjoy the hotel/city.

"“Great Hotel & Location and will definately be back” Travelled over from Ireland and from our first arrival to checking out we had a great experience. Rayvonne was the lady who checked us in and took time to explain all the amenities to us and dealt with the few queries we had, her helpful and friendly attitude was the start of a great 4 night experience in The New Yorker. My shopaholic wife had Maceys at our door step whilst I was only a short distance from Central Park where I did a lot of running. We also attended a show on 42nd street adjacent to time square which was only 5 mins walk away. We used both the Tick Tock diner, the hotel lounge and gym and all was a very pleasant experience. Our room was a suite and was a great size equivalent to an apartment with balcony which was great making our holiday a greater experience.

"“Size matters” We knew we had a room problem when front desk answered my question ""has it a view"" with ""it has a window"". Who says they don't do irony in the States. The room was tiny, just a queen bed and carpet space sufficient for our two cases to stand upright. We almost had to take it in turns to breathe out. But we were rescued from this problem by ? Biquet. I requested a paid upgrade but there was nothing until Biquet thought, checked , then offered a much bigger room (very comfortable queen, armchair, fridge, desk, chair, plenty of floor space, huge bathroom). Biquet, you saved our next two days. Many thanks. Air con was central, piped, quiet and effective, a huge plus given the 95F heat wave on July 24 / 25. Bed was very comfortable and Art Decor furnishings nice and modern. The view was over to Hudson River so only a little bit of NY street noise intruded, with sirens, taxis plus some drilling at 5am out on the streets, but hey this is New York.
Location is brilliant for walking Central Manhattan and also quick for the subway. Penn Stn a block away and Port Transit Authority was walk-able. Empire State Building was in your face when you looked up ... loved the sign stating the obvious pointing to ESB.
Security around the lifts was reassuring rather than annoying. We were never asked for our room cards but good to know someone would stop routine access to guest areas. Lifts up to floor 20 seemed to be taken by students. Hotel guests seemed to be floors 21 & higher using the opposite bank of lifts. On leaving we took a yellow cab back to Newark airport from the rank outside hotel. Standard fee of $68 inclusive of tolls but not tip. We were too late to book with the in-hotel limo franchise, but to be honest we could then go when we wanted rather than worry our car wouldn't arrive.

Upom arrival, after a long flight from LOndon, we waited about 30 minutes to be seen by reception. The man at reception was very unhelpful and not very pleasant. He told us we had been given two double rooms, although we had asked for two twin rooms a the time of booking. I pointed out to him that this would be innappropriate as it could be some way looked upon as incestuous if my 20 yr old son was to share a bed with either his mother, gran or 16 yr old sister.
His attitude was one of he couldnt care less. In the end we had to pay a further $140 to get a different room.
On checkout we had the same unfriendly greeting.

"“Great Hotel but Bathroom could do with a bit of TLC” My first trip to New York so my first to the New Yorker...
We stayed for 7 nights and the hotel is pretty much spot on, up to date with an art deco feel (which I loved as they'd kept to the hotels original design). The only fault I had was that the bathroom could do with some TLC...the door had a hole in, the shower leaked, there was a hole in the floor and some of the tiling had come away. The lighting was also a bit dingy. 
Other than that the room was spot on; comfy bed, modern furniture, and tastefully decorated.
All of the staff were friendly (with the exception of the staff in the Bar, we found a few of them rude & ignorant). Check in/out was quick & smooth. As per other reviews - they do take a deposit from your card (it's 'held') so make sure you have the funds before you check in. We had a safe deposit box within reception as this was very secure.
A great location - a short walk to the Empire State, closer than you think to Times Square and easily accesible as a subwaystation is just two minutes away. Places to eat are pretty close too, even for quick things like Subway/Pizza. The Tick Tock Diner is great for breakfast, and has the 'American' size portions for everything.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. Especially if they give the bathrooms a bit of love!",RLLo86,2011-08-01,122005,2011-08-23,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Location is key...” The greatest thing about this hotel is the location. (one block from penn train station, 6 blocks from bus terminal and 10 minutes walk to times square. )
Rooms are very small, all with queen size beds, no king bed what so ever. The bathroom functional but old and require a renovation. You get very few towels to say the least. Bell people charge you 1/2 of the storage fee up front! (As if they don't you will simply leave your suite cases there!)
If you can get this hotel at a decent price (mid 100's) and stay there for few days while exploring New York city it's fine. Otherwise for longer stays I don't recommand it.
One more thing, if you do arrive by car late on Saturday, you may get lucky and find a free parking space on the streets surrounding the hotel.

"“Very good, good accomodation and location” On entering the the lobby it is very impressive, and the attention to detail with the art deco refurb is excellent.
The room is quite small, but I stayed in other NY hotels during the trip ad found it to be normal size for the citybut it was fine for 2 adults and 2 children as others have siad the bathrooms are a little dated, but functioned well, and always hot water.
There was no tea/coffe making faclities, but that again was normal for the city.
We primarily choose this hotel becuase of location and price. We arrived on a train into Penn Station and walked to the New Yorker within minutes and it was easy to find. We also used the Port authority bus terminal which was within 10 mins walk and just along the same street. 
The gift shop in the basement has all the normal tourist fayre but was considerably cheaper than anywhere else.
The tick tock diner was fine, and a good oppurtunity to experience an American Diner.
We also pre booked a taxi/van for 8 persons using the transport desk in the lobby and that worked well and was a good price.
We found security on the lifts, but again this was normal in NY.",Shadelle128,2011-08-01,122005,2011-08-21,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“If you want to be in a central location, you won't be sorry.” If I ever go back to NYC, I'll probably stay at the New Yorker. 
The good: The location is absolutely amazing. It's within walking distance of so many of the city's great attractions: Times Square, Madison Square Gardens, 5th Avenue and the Empire State Building (And, when I say ""walking distance"", I don't mean 30-minute treks; more like 5 to 15 minutes).
For anything further out, there's a very central station just a few steps away. 
Also, if you're on one of the higher floors, the view is awesome. The bed is comfy.
A pricey breakfast isn't included, which I consider a good thing. But there's a really nice diner right next door that has the best pancakes I've ever eaten. And there's cheap vendors just outside where you can get coffee and a bagel for $3.
The bad: The standard rooms are pretty small, and the bathroom is a bit outdated. (It's clean, though.) The hotel's huge, so it's always bustling with people. Although, our room was way up on the 35th floor or something like it, and we didn't hear a thing -- not even from the busy city below.
The staff are helpful, but don't expect top-notch friendly service. They always seem to be busy.

"“Location location location” A fairly good, standard hotel. It's very big and a bit old, which seems hard to hide. Both the hotel's interior and facilities bears the imprint of ""better times"", as it sometimes seem to be the case with these large, ""iconic"" hotels.
You can definately find cheaper hotels, both in Midtown and NYC in generel. At this place, however, the expense seems fair because of two undisputable facts: 
1) The location. I was visiting with my girlfriend, who hadn't been to NYC before, and there's no way around it. When You go for the first time, Midtown is the place to be. Close to everything and sizzling with life, noise, smells etc. 
2) The view. We were lucky to get a room on the 35th floor, and jesus christ, what a view! You had the whole skyline of Midtown, which was really cool to get up to in the morning. Like the skyscrabers of NY waved a ""Good Morning!"" to you every morning:o) The hotel offers special view rooms, which You of course have to pay for. The view we had, however, was just the standard on 35th floor. And thanks a million for that!
All in all a somewhat standard hotel, which - if it hadn't been for the location and the view - would get three dots.

The room was nicely furnished and very clean. Great location. Many places were within walking distance and the subway was very close.

"“LOVED IT WILL BE BACK !!” Stayed here for a birthday celebration, always wanted to visit NYC. It lived up to all my expectations and MORE!! Picked this hotel on friends recommondations and reviews and wasn't dissapointed. First of all fantastic location ( as a first time visitor i was a little apprehensive about getting around NY ) but my fears were soon put to rest, it was right next to PENN ST station (subway ) and we found it easy to find the different places we wanted to see. We purchased a Metro-Card and it was really easy to use, on entering the subway you use the ticket machine to load your card with money. We put 30 dollars on ours and that lasted us for the 5 days of travel we wanted.
The hotel is a typical old New York Building, high and full of character.Rooms were of excellent standard with everthing we needed. I know some have stated the rooms are on the small side but ours was not. We were on the 36th floor and the Empire state builing was right outside our window FANTASTIC!! Beds were very very comfy and we asked to have a coffee machine brought to the room and it was brought up within 30mins. The staff were friendly and helpful and the TIC TOCK Diner was brill !

The room has an older feel, but it it was clean and the beds were comfortable. There was room for a rollaway bed which we requested ahead . We had a great view of the Empire State building. We arrived at the hotel at 10:30am and were expecting to have to store our luggage until check in time, but the staff had a room available and offered it to us for which were were very grateful.

"“Surprisingly first rate hotel ambience in wonderful location” Having read some prior negative reviews regarding small room size, and having already booked our room at this hotel, I was a little worried.
We are in room 3319 and the room is definitely spacious enough for a short trip. We don't feel the room is excessively small at all.
Art deco in the building is wonderful.
Staff very friendly and professional.
View and location are wonderful.
Tick Tock Diner, which is attached to hotel, is a great option for 24 hour dining.
If you don't have $500 upwards to spend on a hotel in this location then the New Yorker is the diamond in the rough. 
Only negative though would be that there is no electronic safe in the room but they do have a safe at reception.
Highly recommended!",ITTP-Prague,2011-08-01,122005,2011-08-19,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Affordable Hotel in New York City” Accommodation in New York City is really, really expensive. There are alternatives such as staying outside the City Center and travelling in but if you don't want to waste time doing this and don't want to go bankrupt either, the New Yorker is an option. 
The location of the New Yorker near Penn Station is great, it's 'affordable' and it has some history to its name and the beds are fine. 
On the downside I find that despite its location the price is still high for what you get. The rooms are relatively small; the bathrooms (despite having some charming period features) are a little tired. [Having said this - an upgrade would have placed this hotel probably in a higher price bracket which may not have made so much sense as there is clearly a lack of affordable accommodation in New York City ] The hotel is so large that the only contact you have with staff is a quick and hasty when checking in and I did not find the breakfast/dining options that were with the hotel very appealing.
Now don't be put off. New York is a wonderful city and high accommodation prices seem to be a fact of life here. So even though for a night stay in the New Yorker you'd have an amazing place to stay in London or Amsterdam - you're in New York and you don't get the same choice for your dollars so it seems. The New Yorker is clean, the beds are fine and you can find plenty of nice places to eat elsewhere. Just don't expect luxury or a personable service.

"“good location - would stay there again!” The New Yorker Hotel had a great location near to Penn Station, Macys and the Empire State Building. It was 10 minutes to Times Square. 
Check in was fast and pleasant. The staff do check your room cards as you get into the lift but I think thats its a good thing. 
The room was small but clean and the bed was compy. The bathroom was a little outdated but nice enough. The TV was good and there was free wi fi. We could hear a tiny amount of street nice in the morning but it wasnt loud. 
The gift shop on the lower level was good and the same price as other places. The tick tock diner was always busy but the food and service was very good and plentiful. 
The only thing - the safes are at reception and they are very small, we had to get a large one (which are limited) to store an i pad and it just fit! You need to wait in a queue at reception and then fill in a form to get access. If there is a queue at the reception, then you are waiting a long time - i found this silly and a waste of time.

"“Hotel was great, would stay again” Just back from my first trip to new york. I stayed at the new yorker hotel on 34thst 8th avenue. Before my trip i checked out many hotels on the internet and couldnt make up my mind which to choose as some of the reviews were off putting. I reviewed the new yorker and wasn't a 100% sure about it but then a friend recommended it to me, so hence i went on that recommendation. The hotel is really central to everything, the room was clean and the maids were in everyday to change the towels and bedding. The staff were really friendly as was the security at the hotel. They have a diner which is opened 24hrs and just across the road they have a 24hrs pizza place and mcdonalds. Penn train station is only a 5 min walk away and if you want to go to newark airport its only $12.50 where a taxi or shuttle will cost you about $80. There is a 24hr pharmacy on the corner if you need any medicines. From the hotel you can walk straight up to 42nd street where u will find times square on the right. Further up leads you to the designer shopping area and central park or u can grab a taxi for about $7. There are mass amounts of diners and restuarants to choose from. My average meal bill for two people including starter , dinner and bottle of wine was $120. I found the drinks to be quite expensive. I paid about $40-$50 for a bottle of red. If its your first time in new york and you are female---well my god your gonny love the shopping lol. I found new york to be pretty clean given the amount of tourists that are there. If you want to go to empire state building then go early in the morning to avoid the queues. The subway system takes a bit of getting use to but is a good means of transport from downtown to uptown. Once again if you are female and planning to use the subways just be alert. I probably wouldn't recommend using the system at night time. If you look quite young but are over 21 you will need to take your passport with you to get an alcholic drink.

The walls were very thin and you could hear everything in the halls, as well as on the street and I was on the 22nd Floor.

"“Excellent base” My daughter and I stayed here for 6 nights starting on July 23rd, after a good flight from Great Britain we arrived at the Hotel, 2000 (local time), check-in was quick and efficient, I had e-mailed ahead to request a view from a high floor, the chap on the desk was very apologetic as the type of room I had asked for was not available with a view, it didnt really matter as I had no intention of staring out of my window for 6 nights,.
The room (2451) was more than acceptable 2 double beds, 2 en-suites and 2 wardrobes, by the time we had hung our clothes we had a quick walk about outside, the humidity was very high but you soon got used to it.
The location of the New Yorker is nigh on unbeatable, with the Subway lines A, C, E and 1, 2, and 3 on the doorstep and access to the lines B, D, F, and M, just a block away, when you throw in access to the Amtrak network at Penn Station you really have got the location sorted.
A good runabout ticket for the Subway cost $29 and that is valid for 6 days, and unlike home is valid all day every day.
Back at the hotel, we did not eat at the TickTock diner, though plenty of people did, you are spoilt for choice with regard of where to eat, there are stacks of places all within 2 minutes walk in all directions, the rooms themselves we found were very comfortable, and after having been on the move for 14 hours a day, were a welcome sight indeed, according to the literature in the room the hotel has 900+ rooms there are 12 lifts 6 for 1-20 and 6 for 21-40, the colour scheme was pleasant with light and dark browns everywhere. The free wi-fi was very welcome, though you could pay extra ($9.95 per day) for faster speeds, another useful extra is the office which is available downstairs and with a swipe of the room card you can access the PC's and a printer to print your boarding cards for the return home.

"“Lovely stay until an item of clothing was stolen” We went to the New Yorker as part of our honeymoon trip. The hotel was basic with small rooms to clean and a good location for sightseeing. Overall stay was very pleasant and we would have no complaints except for one thing which tainted our view of the place. When on the train to the airport, I remembered I had left a cardigan in the room. Normally forgetting an item of clothing would not bother me but this was an item I wore on my wedding day so had sentimental value. We emailed the hotel asking for the cardigan to be posted to us and we asked how much this would cost. The hotel took a long time to write back and when they did, their lost and found dept they said they did not find the item. My husband wrote back asking them to check again as we knew exactly where we had left it and mentioned the sentimental value of this item. To date, we have not received a response. It looks like one of the staff took a liking to my cardigan and never handed it over to lost and found which is really disappointing. What is also disappointing is the hotel choosing to not respond to our emails. I see past reviews have mentioned cash being stolen from rooms so I would be wary staying in the New Yorker again.",bkatrina,2011-07-01,122005,2011-08-15,False,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Basic, but a good location” The location is great, and the hotel is basic. The rooms are very much like private hostel rooms but it was fine. Not noisy at all but we were up pretty high and not facing the street at all.
The staff are odd, when we said we didn't want our room cleaned when asked housekeeping the lady walked off in disgust and muttered ""well that's not good for me!"" Seriously, there wasn't enough room for our valuables in the safe...actually, there may not have been one at all now that I think of it, so it was easier for us to just make our own bed for 1 night than have someone come into the room when we weren't there.
The free wifi was a surprise, and seemed to work well which was great. 
Would probably stay here again as the location is fantastic, but it's always cheaper to book rooms through expedia than the hotel's website directly.

"“Great hotel in a fabulous location” Stayed at this hotel for 9 days with my parents. The room although basic suited our needs for our first trip to NYC, it was clean and the pillows are the best i have ever slept on!!!!. Our room had great views looking onto the Empire State building and beyond. The hotels location is fab- 5 mins from Macys and about 10mins into Times square. The Tick Tock diner is a great base for breakfast, but we also went to the Starlight diner and the Stage door diner which are both located close to the hotel on 8th Ave.
Whilst in New York be sure to visit Jersey Gardens outlet mall which has great discounted shops, take your passport with you to the customers services desk and you will recieve a great discount booklet!! The bus to the mall departs every 30mins from Port Authority bus station ( 42nd st) and a return ticket is only $12!!!
We bought a 7 day subway pass which was great value at only $29, as you can travel all around Manhatten with this. Be sure to get a map for the subway as the stations are not signposted very well and it can sometimes be hard to ensure you are at the right platform. I think New York should maybe look at London's tube system as this is so easy to travel around!!
Overall though this is a great hotel and i will be staying here again on my next visit to New York.",Suzie_G_7,2011-07-01,122005,2011-08-12,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“A good hotel in a great location!” Myself and my husband had previously stayed at the New Yorker in January 03 and we decided to stay here again as the service and the location of the hotel is so good. Walking distance to many great places such as Times Square, Macy's. Madison Square Gardens and the Empire State Building. We were not disappointed on this trip. The staff were friendly and helpful, a quick check in and a lovely room (which had been renovated since we had last visited). A nice touch is that you have to show your room key before you are allowed in the elevators, good for security.
A fantastic hotel, clean, comfortable and good amenities. The little shop located in the basement had lots of lovely NY gifts and it was cheaper then some of the souvenir stores. The gym was small but had a good range of machines avaliable, although we ran out of time to use it. 
Only 2 drawbacks really. 1 was that we had arranged for the hotel transfer service to take us back to the airport, we were not told at the time of booking that there were only set times available and not upon request, When we tried to rearrange the time, there were no others available and so had to use the private car hire instead (which was lovely and very comfortable but at a higher price then we had wanted to pay).
The other drawback was that when we had received a phonecall (from the hotel transport service) to our room, we were charged for the call. Only 1 or 2 $ but not very fair I feel, esp as we are using an in-house service and that they had called us.
Overall our stay at the New Yorker was fantastic! A great hotel, fab location, lots of places to eat and visit around it and lots of places within walking distance!

"“Will happily return to the New Yorker” My husband and I travelled to the States in November 2010 and stayed at the New Yorker for 7 nights in the smallest room. It was very very tiny which I think is what is normal for New York but certainly an eye-opener and a little bit cosy. As you step into the room, our queen sized bed was possibly 3 steps away, bathroom two steps to the right and there was very little space for our suitcases. We were only there to sleep and see the city, so this didn't bother us : )
Although we were told the hotel had been renovated, the bathroom was a little dated. 
The front desk, security and concierge were absolutely lovely, friendly and accommodating. 
We didn't really enjoy the Tick Tock diner, but fell in love with what became our regular breakfast joint...the Stage Door.

"“Nice hotel, if a bit faceless” Stayed in July 2011 as part of a long trip round the Eastern United States. Only three nights, and nothing exceptional to record. For two adults and a 14 year old it was a bit cramped in one of the twin doubles on the 20th floor, with little closet space, but we weren't there long enough to be bothered. I quite liked the fact that the older fittings in the rooms hadn't just been ripped out and replaced with new stuff - the Art Deco stylings in the room and the hotel were nice. 
Minor quibble - the dusty tile edgings in the bathroom (your cleaners need to look up as well as down). Otherwise pleasant, quiet and trouble free. The area around the hotel isn't the best, but don't be intimidated by the odd weirdo outside on the street - they appear to a feature of all corners of New York! 
This is a very big hotel, and like many big hotels, it fades in splendour as you move inwards away from the impressive and large front entrance lobby. The size also makes the hotel a bit faceless, and the human touch at the front desk needs to be maintained by all staff to counteract this. For example, Check in - friendly and efficient, Check out - perfunctory and pretty neutral. Disney could teach some of your staff a thing or two. Drawbacks - No restaurant and a overpriced bar adjacent with offhand and very inefficient bar staff. On other recommendations, we went to the Skylight Diner one block away from the hotel for breakfast - excellent!",WaveyDavey61,2011-07-01,122005,2011-08-10,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

We arrived around midnight and were checked in quite quickly we dumped our bags and went for a walk and within 10 minutes we were in Times Square.

Times Square was a short walk away and the Empire State building was also very close. The hotel is right beside Penn station so getting on the subway was very easy. 
The room itself was decorated nicely and was very comfortable. The only drawback that I could think of was the lack of an exhaust fan in the bathroom. The window opened but it was still a little bit inconvenient having to wipe down and wait for the mirror to be usable. Its not a big deal but I just wanted to mention it for full disclosure.

"“Good Hotel - for the price” Me and my partner stayed here in February 2011, my fifth time in NY. As a fairly experienced traveller to NY i have experienced both 1 star and 4/5 star hotels. This hotel falls in the middle ground in terms of overall decor and facilities.
The key to any review on a hotel in NY is understanding what you want - for most people, location is key, and for this the New Yorker scores highly. Very good location, within walking distance of Penn Station, Empire State building, Macy's & has places to eat such as Pizza places, Mcdonalds etc. very close by. 
In terms of the hotel itself, its very large and therefore has constant streams of people from all walks of life circulating through. The staff were…okay, i have had better I’ve had worse. Check in was relatively smooth, when checking out however i did have to pay (about $8) for them to hold bags. 
This also leads onto my biggest gripe which was them hailing down the taxi for the ride back to the airport. 
The guy at the door was extremely rude, and took ages to hail a cab. When he did, he put our bags (without asking) into a ‘Private cab’ i.e. not a affiliated NY yellow cab. 
I questioned why he was using a private cab, and asked how much it would cost (JFK to Manhattan should be no more than $50 incl. toll). I said i would pay no more than $50 and the private taxi driver agreed to this, so was happy to go along with it….however i do not recommend this for inexperienced travellers as they can take the biscuit when it comes to pricing.
I didn’t think much of the guy at the New Yorker using a private cab and for the service on checking out, as there is clearly some back hand dealing between the cabby and the hotel worker going on!
Overall with this place you have to accept that you are not going to get many luxuries (and you shouldn’t be paying that much for what you get), the room itself was small (i had a basic a bed room), but for me when i go to NY i am rarely in my room so can live with it being small (As long as it is clean, which it was). Also have to give kudos for the free broadband usage (actually managed to download an update for my new iPad using their broadband!)
I would recommend this hotel for its location, if you are one of these people who are extremely fussy about the rest of the hotel package then i would suggest looking elsewhere. However a convenient base for the average shopper/sight seeker….it ticks the boxes and serves a purpose.",willsilto,2011-02-01,122005,2011-08-05,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“I'll stay here again” This is an old hotel, just over 80 now, but well maintained. Lots of art deco features, it would have been the classiest place in NY in the 30's, but still very appealing today. Rooms and bathrooms are small compared to what you would get in hotels in much of the rest of the US for half the price, just saying not complaining, this is expensive New York City after all.
There is nowhere to stay in NYC that is next to everything, there will always be some walking or public transport involved. With that in mind, the location is good, next to the subway, a block away from Penn Station and a block away from Macy's for the shopaholics. 
For a cheap breakfast walk up 8th Ave just past 36th St to White Castle, sort of a predecessor to McD's if you look at the photos around the walls. 2 bacon and egg sandwiches and a coffee for $3.58, but don't expect 5 star service at those prices.",r-j-ward,2011-07-01,122005,2011-08-05,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Hotel is not amazing luxury but is very clean, staff very friendly, rooms were nice (beds very comfortable and room size is fine for the amount of time you will spend in there!!) - to be fair people you get what you pay for, but really who needs a 5 star in New York, your in one of the most exciting cities in the world, are you seriously going to spend time in your room?
Food in Tick Tock diner was good, not the cheapest but not the most expensive and very convenient when you have spent the day sightseeing and just want to crash. 
No complaints about the hotel, I emailed the concierge before we arrived and mentioned it was my mum's birthday, they kindly presented her with a box of chocolates on arrival!!!
If anybody is wondering about how much to spend in NY i took $800 for 5 nights/ 6 days and this got me a bit of shopping, lots of sightseeing and all food and drink.
If you are on a budget, please google free tours by foot, we had a 7 hour walking tour all over lower manhatten on the first day where you just leave a tip. This was well worth it and great for your first day in the BIG APPLE!!

"“'We loved it too'” We had an excellent stay at the New Yorker (although we had a problem booking in as the receptionist was looking at the date of the booking not the dates we were staying but was very apologetic when she finally sorted it out which took some time). The rooms were fairly small but adequate and exceptionally clean and we had clean towels every day even though we had hung them up on alternative days.
The Tick Tock diner was excellent, we had dinner there the first night and breakfast on three days and couldn't fault the food and we were always served glasses of iced water, with the exception of the last day when the waitress who served us obviously didn't enjoy her job. It took her ages to come and serve us and when she finally came she certainly wasn't as pleasant as the rest staff who had served us. and she then bought one of us the wrong omelette and wasn't very happy about replacing it.. She didn't bring us any water and never asked if we would like more coffee or tea. Such a shame especially on our last day!
The New Yorker is in an excellent location and we were able to walk to Macy's, Times Square, and Grand Central Station and in the evening we walked to a very good Italian Restaurant and also to John's Pizza Restaurant.

“Best value and location for New York tourist” My daughter and I traveled to New York from Boston on the train and discovered that the New Yorker was quite close to Penn Station. We loved the Art Deco decor and while the lobby was busy we were quickly checked in to our room. We were lucky enough to get a refurbished room which was on a corner and quite large. The bathroom was large and luxurious with marble and tile. The diner was somewhat overpriced but there are so many other food choices around the hotel that this was inconsequential. We easily hopped on subways to tour Manhattan and were within easy walking distance to the Theatre and Times Square. We did have trouble trying to get information from the concierge as this really is a very busy hotel. We would definitely stay here again.,travelinout,2010-08-01,122005,2011-07-30,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“A highlight of the holiday!!!” The new yorker hotel is just all round brilliant. We were visiting new york fo the first time this summer and so looking for a place to stay, we didn't want somewhere too expensive as we felt in a city like new york you would hardly be in it. I was'nt quite sure what to expect and i was more than pleasantly suprised. The interior and grandeur of the lobby was similar to such grand iconic buildings as the empire state and rockerfeller. This levely of quality continued everywhere from the corridors to the rooms. From reading other reviews I had expected the rooms to be extremely small, because of this my party of 4 booked two rooms. The two rooms did provide some more space but the rooms were not as small as made out... Infact if on a budget 4 could sleep in one room.
The dining was also at the same standard as the rest of the hotel. The tick tok diner provided good quality 1950s themed dining at a reasonable price.
The hotel also could not have been situated better... It was a 5 minute walk to many of the big attractions such as times square, macy's, empirestate etc. It was also just across the road from penn station where there was a subway stop as well as a train that ran to the airport
The staff were very helpfull and provided emaculate service.

The hotel is very comfortable, the staff polite and helpful, everything is clean, the free WiFi connection is prima. The only thing we missed was the breakfast. We did not find the TickTock Diner good, it was expensive and the staff was not polite. So we chose the Cafe Bistro, on 34th Street, two minutes from the hotel, towards 9th Ave, on the other side.

"“Great view, good value and central” We stayed at the New Yorker over the Easter break/Spring break, in hindsight very bad timing. As a family of five, with three eleven year old children, our hotel options in New York were limited. We narrowed the field to Doubletree Times Square, Courtyard Midtown East and The New Yorker. The New Yorker won out based on price and views.
We booked a Tower Suite, located on the top three floors of the hotel to guarantee a view. As it was our first trip to New York we requested direct views of the Chrysler Building and Empire State Building. Our room was on the 39th floor. It had a bedroom with 2 double beds, built in robes and a flat screen tv with great views of the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building and Madison Square Gardens. Adjoining the bedroom was a small lounge with a sofa bed( double), desk, sink, coffee maker and fridge and a very small bathroom. The room was nice but a bit tired in an old world charm (art deco) sort of way!
Rooms on the top 3 floors have breakfast included in the breakfast room which was lovely and only a few doors up from our room. We loved the fact that the breakfast room was a calm and relaxing start to the day before we hit the crazy rush and chaos of New York. The options included Bagels, toast, danishes and muffins, cereals, fruit, yoghurts, granola/muesli bars, juice, tea and coffee. Perfect for filling up three hungry kids. The breakfast room is on the corner of the 39th floor and has fantastic views out to the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State and Chrysler buildings. They have a flat screen tv so you can catch up on world news events and check the days weather forecast. Orlando does a great job replenishing the breakfast bar and always has a welcoming smile.
The breakfast room only operates Mon-Fri. Vouchers are provided for the a Tick Tock Diner off the main lobby for weekend breakfast. This is a retro diner, a novelty but average service and food. The kids enjoyed the experience but the food was bland. We ate at Coopers Tavern one night which is a restaurant/bar. Food was ok, service was lacking.
The hotel was on the subway line to Central Park and across the road from Madison Square Gardens and Penn station which would suit sports fans or concert goers.
Liked:
Fantastic views of the city skyline.
Great pre-arrival assistance via email from Kelvin in reservations helping select the best room for our needs and placing requests for allergy free pillows!
Great value for a family of five around US 260 p.n plus tax
One block from Macys Herald Square, Kmart across street with a small supermarket in the basement. 
Subway outside entrance.
Small gift shop in basement for postcards and souvenirs which was good value.
Disliked:
No assistance with luggage on arrival. 
Long queue to check in.
Long queue for concierge assistance.
Service levels could be better.
Not a great area at night. A bit uncomfortable with young kids.

I would recommend this for anyone wanting to experience the fireworks without the crowds as you could see all 6 barges and even fireworks in the neighboring Burroughs and cities.,Zeropoli,2011-07-01,122005,2011-07-28,False,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Good location” Checkin was very slow and inpersonal. Provided with room on 21st floor which backed unto a lift. The walls vibrated as if they were being hit with a sledge hammer. Immediately rang the front desk and was told that this room was not near anything and that they could not understand the noise, but if it continued we should ring the Manager later in the evening. We went out for a very enjoyable walk around New York and returned to the hotel a few hours later. The noise remained of course - they obviously were not going to switch off the lifts!! We knew we had been told a blatant lie earlier but contacted the Manager to see if we had any better luck. We talked to Erica who was brilliant - she changed the room without any fuss, after asking if we would like to view it first. It's a pity the other staff were not as professional, pleasant and honest. 
Otherwise our stay at the hotel was good - the rooms were clean, the beds comfortable and a number of rooms have good skyline views of NY. However, a coffee maker and a fridge would help. We did not have breakfast at the hotel but the Tick Tock diner is very good. A good hotel in a good location. Certainly not luxurious, but we would go back if we got it at the right price. We would check out the other hotels first though. 
The hotel is beside Penn Station (which has a metro stop, rail connections to Newark Airport and Amtrak), Madison Square garden, Macy's and the Empire state building. Time Square and the threatre district are also within easy walking distance.
The demand for accommodation in New York is extremely high and therefore the demand may automatically fill beds, however I would advise some staff at the New Yorker to remember who pays their wages and ensure that customer relations and satisfaction are at the top of their list of priorities.",dell08,2011-07-01,122005,2011-07-28,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

However we'd booked a suite on the very top floor and it t room with superb views. Breakfast is served in an executive room with lovely views. It's actually self service;the food selection is a bit limited but ok.
On arrival at the main lobby, the receptionist, Jimmy was incredibly rude, even by New York standards. he must have had a hard day. Not very professional at all.

I would recomend trying the breakfast on the 39th floor atleast once, but it turns out, if you do: You're gonna get a bill for breakfast every day of your stay. Even if you specify to the gentleman serving breakfast that you only want to try it once.

"“Great service and a great location” We stayed here for just one night in late June 2011, but we had a great time. We arrived c. 11 am, and did not think we could check in that early, but they had suite available which they gave us (ie, a free upgrade). Wow, this was incredible. It had a (non-working) fireplace, a living room area with a large dining table, and best of all, 1.5 bathrooms. We needed some extra towers at one point and they were delivered in a few minutes. The beds and everything else were as comfortable as any place we have ever stayed; the rooms were spotless, and also had 2 widescreen flat tvs. We had to leave some luggage the next day for pickup later; this was easy, altho they charge c. $2 per bag (maybe this is standard now). The air conditioning was great; and the location is incredibly convenient to subway travel. As it is, we drove into NYC; there is a semi-discount lot down the block (going west); the hotel also has its own valet parking at standard NYC rates (ie, not cheap). The immediate area has some low cost chain eateries as well as a pizzeria across the street (very tasty), and an amazing Chinese/Asian buffet bakery/restaurant a half block away going east (you can eat lunch for $5, no joking). Really, this is hard to beat (they honor AAA discounts).",melson3,2011-06-01,122005,2011-07-27,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Would stay here again” Arrival is a bit chaotic because you have to pull over on 8th Ave (this is NYC – there’s no convenient parking spot under an awning while you check in). Taxis are lined up out front so there isn’t much room for arriving cars, but in NYC you have to be an assertive driver anyway so you have to just unapologetically stop wherever you need to and unpack your car. Not a relaxing process, but there’s no way around it.
Valet parking was $35 a day, which is about average in that area, but here’s the kicker – you can’t access your car at all during your stay or it’s an extra $35 when you bring it back. Of course, you won’t need your car if everything you’re doing is in walking distance or accessible by taxi, but we had planned to drive out to Scarsdale one day, so that rule changed our plans because we basically didn’t have a car.
The bellhop who brought our luggage up after check-in was beyond unfriendly, bordering on angry, but he got the job done. Make sure you have small bills on you for tips.
The Metro room was tiny, as they are in most NYC hotels. I immediately checked for bed bugs and there was no evidence, everything seemed very clean. The view was great – Madison Square Garden and the NYC skyline.
There were two used bars of soap in the shower, but no big deal, we threw them away. The bathroom was tiny. The door didn’t stay closed, so when you’re on the toilet, you have to hold the door closed w/ your hand or foot. I wish they still put exhaust fans in hotel bathrooms, what happened to that practice? I guess that’s part of cost-cutting, so if you’re big on privacy, you won’t get it here. 
The only thing I would suggest for both the room and the bathroom is that they make better use of wall space and install some shelves. There is a tiny glass shelf above the bathroom sink that didn’t fit half of our toiletries and there’s no soap dish, so it’s a whole game of keeping the soap from sliding into the sink and propping your personal items perfectly so they stay on the shelf. Almost comical really.
The concierge was fabulous! He knew the city well and had suggestions for everything we asked – a good diner, a good Italian restaurant, the Broadway schedule, the Circle Line cruise procedures (I highly recommend this cruise, BTW). 
The fitness center was clean, the machines seemed new, they had everything we needed (pullup bar, cardio machines, all weight machines), and it wasn’t crowded.
Overall, the price of the hotel was great for NYC and the location can’t be beat if you want to be in midtown Manhattan, the heart of the action. We would definitely stay here again.",enathan119,2011-07-01,122005,2011-07-27,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Location, Location, Location” A great place to stay! 2 blocks from Macy's and the Empire State Building. Right next to Madison Square Garden. This is about my 12th trip to the city and always for vacation. I've stayed all over based up availability and this ranks as #1 or #2 on my list. I booked a single ""queen"" bed - funny how hotel standards for Queen differ slightly from retail stores. What the bed lacked in size made up for in comfort. You will read reviews about noise. I booked room at a discount price offered through an internet special. So you already know that the rooms they are promoting may not be as desireable. The room I had was just a couple of doors down from he cleaning service's storage area. So lots of banging and noise in the mid-morning hours. Don't plan to sleep in! The hotel's diner was always busy but that didn't delay service at all. Great menu and open 24 hours. The lobby is welcoming. The bar - didn't spend much time there and they close pretty early so I'll let someone else review it. I was pleased with the standard room size.

"“great first leg of our honeymoon!” We stayed at the New Yorker for 5 nights before heading to Mexico. Check in was smooth, staff very helpful. On taking a look at our standard rom, we decided to upgrade as the room was just a tad too small, it cost $30 a night to upgrade to a bigger room, with good views of the Hudson. 
The lobby was very nice, as was the bar and the tick tock diner was very handy for food at all times of the day. I also made good use of the gym, which was far better than i had first thought, lots of eqiupment to use, and not too busy.
The location of the newyorker is just fabulous, about a 5 min walk to Maceys and Empire state, and about 10-15 mins walk to Times square and the Theatres. We had no problems with noise, although we did have the air con on as New York in July was sooo hot! 
We received a box of chocolates on arrival as it was our honeymoon which was a nice touch! However given my friend had emailed before hand and they had promised her the earth we were a little underwhelmed!

Bathroom a bit on the small side but good shower pressure.
Tick Tock diner which is reached from inside the hotel and also external did a great choice for breakfast, reasonable prices.

"“Perfect Honeymoon Stay at The New Yorker” We stayed here for 5 nights from 3rd July to 8th July on the first stop on our honeymoon tour of America. We were greeted with super friendly staff who looked genuinely pleased to check us in, a brilliant restaurant recommendation was given to us that night by the receptionist and we were told that as it was our honeymoon they'd given us a room on the 37 floor which was central in the hotel with panoramic views of the Hudson River so we'd be able to enjoy the 4th of July fireworks from our room. They'd also given us two complimentary breakfasts to enjoy at the Tick Tock Diner downstairs! 
When we arrived in our room we were pleasantly surprised, although not roomy it was certainly spacious enough for two people and we even had a bath which we never expected in NYC! The decor was beautiful and very in keeping with the era the hotel. It was immaculately clean and they'd even left a little box of chocolates in the room for us to enjoy. The beds were very comfortable too! We couldn't have been happier!
It's also an ideal location for loads of attractions such as Times Square/Broadway, Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building etc etc!
A particular mention must be made to the staff at the hotel, from concierge to receptionists to bell boys to housekeeping they were all happy, helpful and pleasant to everyone! Also the Tick Tock Diner downstairs is really good value for money considering the size of the portions you're given which are more than enough for two to share one portion and again the staff there were excellent. 
We stayed at the Waldorf=Astoria for our last night of the trip to NYC and it was literally 3 times the cost of staying at the New Yorker. The room was marginally larger, the decor was more tired and of approximately 10 staff that we encountered about 8 of them were rude and obnoxious. They could learn A LOT from the New Yorker!!

"“Not bad” Overall not a bad hotel and is in a great location to get you wherever, as we were out most of the time we weren't so bothered about the small bathroom (great powershower though!) but hey you dont spend that much time in your hotel room do you? The only complaint I would have about this hotel is when we arrived and got to the desk we were informed to hand over a credit card which we were a bit concered about. We then got informed they were taking a deposit of $300 off the card to make sure we do not smoke in the room, now to a non-smoker this is very annoying. I explained the whole holiday was paid off (including the hotel) and that our travel agents had not mentioned anything about this. He rudely replied it wasn't his problem and he was just reading what was on the screen. He then informed us we would have to wait 3 hours for our room to be ready even though check in was at 3pm and this was 4pm. He explained it was a great room with a great view so hey we thought it might be worth the wait, When we finally got to the room it wasnt too bad but not the best, couldn't see any amazing views though! At the end of the holiday we got to the airport to find my friend had left her purse there. We rang the hotel and they managed to find it and insisted on posting it out to us straight away instead of being in a panic. This did make up for the begining of the holiday.",Alewal_11,2011-07-01,122005,2011-07-24,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location, great hotel” Stayed at the New Yorker Hotel on the 35th floor in July 2011 for a week. Great hotel and location is PERFECT. You are on the same city block as the A, C, E subway line, one block away from the 1,2,3 line and two blocks away from the N,R,D,B,Q,W lines. Macy's is one block away on 7th ave, and Times Square is under a ten minute walk from the hotel. You literally can get to most of New York's main attractions from all of these subway lines. (Totally get a metro pass for your stay)
Rooms were a bit smaller than what you would expect, but it doesn't really matter because it's just a room... and there is New York to see! Nicely renovated rooms, comfy beds, and yes, bathrooms are a little dated in terms of style, but it's clean! 
There is a diner on the main floor of the hotel that serves food all day. Only had breakfast , it was good, but the portion sizes are huge! You may want to split a plate if you aren't too hungry. There are lots of great food places around too, I liked the pastry/croissant place in Chelsea called La Maison du Macaron and the pizzeria places around the hotel. There is a really good Thai food place called Aura that is around the corner on 36st and 9th ave too.
Hotel is clean, staff is friendly, and there is a gym and gift shop in the basement. The gift shop has reasonable prices on some items. There is free wifi in the hotel, which is nice. You do have the option of paying for a higher speed of internet. 
I recommend this hotel and would definitely return on a future visit to NYC!",mjp3,2011-07-01,122005,2011-07-23,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location, okay hotel” I stayed at the New Yorker for a week in October 2010. I thought it was just okay. The room was very dark and we had a few instances of staff being a bit on the abrupt side. One thing to definitely avoid - Tick Tock Diner. The fries were like cardboard and the service was non-existent. Location is amazing for Broadway and Empire State building, which we went up at midnight and had no queues and an amazing time! Probably wouldn't stay here again though.",Hushabymountain,2010-10-01,122005,2011-07-23,True,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Loved this place... Will definitely stay here next time were in NYC” We stayed here for a week in March 2011.
I went with my boyfriend and his parents, after a nice long trip across the atlantic we had quite a stessful time at the airport with our transfer, and the traffic into the city was awful, We were asked to jump out of the shuttle about a block away from the hotel and walk the rest of the way. 
When we got to the hotel, Check in was fine although pretty slow, (There was a major conference going on, which was taking up the whole of the lobby area) The place was buzzing, We were given a room on the 21st floor, the view was absolutely dire.(didn't care about the view, I had no intention of sitting in my room looking out of the window)
The hotel is amazing!!! The rooms are totally adequate for 1 weeks stay, (although we were tripping over our shopping by the end of the week)
We went for breakfast every morning in the tick tock diner, This was brilliant, every day we all had something different, the menu was huge, from big gutsy breakfasts to fresh fruits, waffles and pancakes. Awesome!! every morning.
We also had drinks in Coopers tavern every afternoon, once we had finished our shopping/sight seeing and were going to get ready for the evening. There was a happy hour on every day except for when anyone was playing at the Madison square Garden (Rod Stewart one day & Elton John the next)
The food in Coopers was lovely, The fillet steak was the best I've ever tasted (and very cheap), the Sizzling Chicken Cesar Salad was lovely but a little large.
The house keeping were good, every day fresh towels and always a nice smile from the team. 
I loved staying in this hotel, It was my 2nd time in NYC but my first in this hotel. I will definitely go back here, I can't wait to book my next trip here, Hopefully looking at March again 2012.",hayles81,2011-03-01,122005,2011-07-22,False,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Nice Hotel & Great Location” My boyfriend and I have just returned from a six night stay at the New Yorker Hotel. The staff were friendly when we arrived and there weren't any problems. Before we arrived in NYC we upgraded our room to a 'View Room'. When we got to our room I was shocked at how small it was. With two suitcases on the floor, we could not move. The bathroom was clean but looked very dated and had a very old shower. There were not any tea or coffee making facilities in the room either. We were on the 36th floor and had a great view of the Empire State. Apart from the room being small, the hotel is in a great location. The hotels restaurant 'Coopers Tavern' is a great place to eat!

"“Housekeeping kept ringing the doorbell!” Many annoyances for this hotel, but will start with the good points first :) 
My spouse and I were there for 5 days. Chose it for the history and location.
It was good for:
1. The location. Look up the map and u'll see what I mean.
It was awful for:
1. Housekeeping who wouldn't stop ringing the doorbell from 8am. This was despite a 'do not disturb' sign being placed on the door knob. They insisted that they have to start cleaning the room by 10am because they have a tight schedule everyday! Otherwise, they will not have time to do it. They did this throughout our stay. And because of point #1 above, the problem was not solved. Did I say the front desk was not helpful as well?
3. Tiny room. Enough floor space for only 1 luggage with minimal walking space.
4. Very old bathroom that desperately needs some upgrading. From shower head that sprays water in ALL directions, rendering the walls and surrounding floor wet, to moldy walls, worn down toilet bowl and flush system... You get my point.
I will never go back, history or not. And I do not recommend this hotel at al.",catfishy1,2011-06-01,122005,2011-07-22,True,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.6,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

This was our first time in NY and would definately pick this hotel when we go back.
We got a free upgrade to a tower suite and the view from our window - the Empire State Building! Wow wasn't in it!
The room was fantastic, clean and modern decor.
The staff were all very friendly and the location right next door to Macys and Madison Square Garden.

"“Excellent Hotel In A Great Location” To my wife here as a surprise for her 40th Birthday, I was a bit concerned at booking the hotel without hr knowing in case I picked a bad one. Should not have worried the Hotel was great, friendly staff and an excellent location as it is just 10 mins from Times Square and Broadway. The Empire State Building is just outside as is Macy's. The hotel also arranged care pick up from the Hotel when we arrived again taking away any stress. The rooms are not massive but had all you need in them and to be fair when in New York why would you sit in your room. The Tic Toc is great value and will fill you up!!! the Bar is also good value. The Hotel provide safe deposit boxes that are installed behind locked doors at the lobby. 
All in all a great break with a hotel that made us feel welcome and safe. Would recommend this without hesitation and will come back in the future",TheMahaWarwick,2011-07-01,122005,2011-07-20,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“good value!” I just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel. I was very happy with my room (I requested a higher floor with a view, based on comments here + got it!). It was clean, comfortable and the hotel is extremely convenient for travellers arriving by train. It was only about a 5 minute walk from Penn Station! Though there were lots of stores, fast food restaurants (Starbucks and McDonalds across the street; 24 hour diner in the hotel) + Macy's in the immediate area, I preferred going elsewhere to find neighbourhoods with a bit more charm. That said, with the A,C, E subway line directly under the hotel, it was easy and quick to get a change of scenery. Overall, good value for your money + conveniently located!",travelling_monkey,2011-07-01,122005,2011-07-19,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“basic but fine” Stayed her from 30th June to 5th July. This place is perfectly placed to get around NYC. You can see the Empire State Building from here and it is just a walk to everywhere. If you don't want to walk there are 2 tube stations right at the side of the hotel, very convenient. The staff were a mixed bunch, sometimes very friendly, sometimes a little surly, but on the whole, no complaints. We were on the 26th floor, the lifts are super quick. The room was very basic and quite small, but apparently this is usual for NYC. The bathroom was very old fashioned and we could not open the window when the room became steamy and the shower was not the best. There was sufficient storage space and the room was cleaned every day. My one gripe would be that there were no tea or coffee making facilities, which was really inconvenient, take a travel kettle if you want a drink without having to go to the diner or down into the lobby. 
I wasn't particularly impressed with the diner, the one evening meal we had was not up to much, although the service was good. The breakfasts were marginally better, but my omelette did not taste of anything, so I would steer clear of that. Whilst tips are expected in America, in NYC the waitress will tell you that she wants you to leave her tip in cash and advises you what she expects from you. After travelling around America and not experiencing this before, I was a little shocked at this. 
There is also a bar attached to the hotel and you can eat here as well. We didn't eat there but enjoyed the atmosphere for a drink and didn't find it any more pricey than anywhere else really. As a base, this is not a bad hotel to explore NYC from overall. When we left, the hotel arranged a taxi transfer to Newark airport for approximately £60, this might sound pricey but it was worth it not to have to negotiate the tube and the airbus with all our luggage. Also, the hotel will store your luggage for $1 per piece - if you have anything in a plastic carrier, try and fit this in your case as you will also be charged for this.
If you can, try to get to Soho on an evening, there are some fantastic bars and restaurants with fabulous atmospheres. You can get almost anything to eat in NYC, stay away from the chains and live a little. Don't bother with a taxi, walking is the best way to see the sights, you stumble across things that you would otherwise miss. The underground is really cheap and easy to use. Travelling with two other women, I felt really safe, no concerns at all. Must see - the 9/11 memorial and the new build that they hope to have finished by 9th of September this year, it'll bring a lump to your throat.",lorrascott,2011-07-01,122005,2011-07-19,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Our room was very clean and, for New York, rather large. The on site diner was fantastic for breakfast and late night snacks, and the staff were willing to help us with their local knowledge and humour.

The hotel was very easy to find, less than a minute from Penn Station, and has subway access adjoined to the hotel on 34th Street. There were 3 of us and we got a room on the 24th floor, with partial views of the ESB, and the Chrysler Building. The room was a little small for 3, and the two beds were definately what we would term ""doubles"", but we managed. We were so worn out when we got back to the room each night, there were never any complaints. The bathroom was old fashioned, but then so is the hotel, still decorated in the art-deco style, which was a nice change from all the modern styling you see in other hotels..

This made me feel safe when coming back late at night. 
 The hotel is just a short walk away round the block from Macy's, Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens. There is a Duane Reade pharmacy across for the hotel which you can buy drinks, snacks and other essentials.

"“Great location, but showing it's age” Great location one block from Penn Station and many subway lines. Walking distance to many attractions. Safe area and very busy. Police presence at all times. Very good security at the hotel. You must show your room key card to get onto the elevators to the rooms. Great ""Tick Tock Diner"" attached to the hotel through the lobby. If you like to have coffee in your room, you must ask for a coffeemaker at check in. The same with a refrigerator. This was our first visit and I had read about the small rooms, but I would describe this as TINY. There is just enough room to walk around the bed. Very limited floor space for bags. Closet is small also, so we couldn't store our luggage in it. 2 nightstand cabinets and 3 dresser drawers are the total of the storage space. One small shelf above the pedestal sink in the bathroom holds very limited toiletries. It was adequate for the 3 days and 4 nights we were there, but for a longer visit, I would have to have a larger room. I know everyone says that you are never in your hotel room anyway, but the reality is that it is very cramped for showering, dressing and just moving around.
We only paid $135 per night through Priceline, so we felt we got our moneys worth. Would definitely stay in that area again, but would try to find a larger room.

"“Would definitely recommend this hotel!” After reading some mixed reviews about this hotel, I was nervous about the room size and also the hotel staff. Neither of these were an issue for us. We originally booked a room facing the empire state building, but when we checked in on July 4th we asked to face the Hudson River to be able to watch the fireworks, we thought we may switch rooms the next night to have a better view of New York. The staff we dealt with were great and helpful. We were surprised that we had to put a deposit down on the room for smoking damage, which I hadn't read about anywhere in the advertisement, and wasn't told when I booked. We loved our room, it was in a corner and was very large. A beautiful view, amazing to watch the fireworks! It had 2 bathrooms and 2 closets. There are 2 things about the room that I would complain about: 1.the double beds (I'm 6 feet and my feet hung over) but other than that they were comfy and I could have chose to upgrade to queen beds I suppose and 2. we could hear the elevator, which at first my teens thought it sounded like a headboard banging in another room, which made them laugh, but it didn't stop, so we learned that it was the elevator. Annoying but we were able to ignore it. The next day we took a look at the room we could change to and it was very small and only had one bathroom (much more like the small room reviews we read) so we ended up deciding to stay in the room facing the river.
The hotel was older, but the rooms were very modern looking, and the fitness room was fantastic. We didn't eat in the diner or the lounge.

"“Hotel with Great Location and Good Value” We arrived around 11 am and we were able to check-in early which is a great plus at a hotel. However, the first room we received we did not like, it was very small and dark and we requested another room which was given to us later in the afternoon at official check-in time. Our new room was much better, spacious with view of the Empire State Building. The location of the hotel is excellent, in walking distance to Time Square and other major attractions. The subway entrance is right around the corner and it takes you to SoHo in 10 min.

"“Great hotel, great location.” My family (two parents, two elementary-aged kids) stayed at the New Yorker for four nights in late June 2011. It was a pretty good stay. Here are the cons and pros:
Cons
1) I was excited when we were told we were getting a free upgrade to a slightly larger corner room, and when we arrived in the room I was quite happy with the room, and (more importantly) my wife liked it. We had just finished a 24 hour trip from the other side of the globe and were somewhat jetlagged, so we went out for a stroll after 10 PM. When I was a kid, you would never have taken a stroll in Manhattan at that time, but now it's perfectly safe. So we walked up and had our first view of Times Square. The hotel is very close to Times Square, but that's a pro, so I'll come back to it. We arrived back in our room and dropped into bed, only to be quickly roused by what sounded like someone pounding on the door. We quickly realized that it was the sound of the elevator. I went through the labyrinth hallways and realized that our nice corner room was right beside the room that houses the big machines that run the elevators. So, all night we heard thunking and pounding whenever anyone used the elevator (in the city that doesn't sleep). 
2) It's expensive, but it's Manhattan, so everything's expensive.
Okay, those are all the cons. Now to the pros:
1) The moment I went to the front desk to complain about the room, they were happy to change our room, so we went from the 23rd floor to a far superior room on the 33rd. The view was better, the room was arranged in a more pleasing way, and best of all - no elevator sounds. Lesson for you, dear reader? Make sure to ask for a room that is not near the elevator machine rooms. But, they were great about changing our room.
2) Did I mention it was close to Times Square? We walked back and forth several times and always felt perfectly safe. It's also close to the Penn Station subway (more on that later), and close to all kinds of food and shopping. 
3) The little cafe below (Tick Tock Cafe) was nice. Expensive, but nice. But hey, it's Manhattan.
4) We rode the subway in from JFK (jetlagged with kids) and it was only a bit confusing for us out-of-towners. We had virtually no problems coming or going, it was cheap, and easy. Save the money for your Tick Tock Cafe breakfast and take the subway! 
5) They had a nice little workout room downstairs that we used a couple of times. It was nice. Also a convenient little business center.
6) We had some friends come up from New Jersey one afternoon, and while in our room, one of their kids got a bit out of control and accidentally knocked over a lamp. We alerted the hotel and were prepared to pay for it, but it was never mentioned to us. We thought this was nice.
7) There is usually a hotel employee standing near the elevators checking that people have keys and are truly guests of the hotel. This made us feel even safer.
So, overall, we would say it's a great place to stay if you are wanting to pay Manhattan prices. Again, just make sure to ask for a room not near the elevator machine rooms and you should love it as well!",Nathan F,2011-06-01,122005,2011-07-14,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

We go down to the reception and got an upgrade for some small money to a 2xqueensbed suite. This was really great. 
And I also urge you to read my review on the TikTok diner who is located under the hotel, it is really great.

"“Loved it again and we'll be back!!” My husband and I stayed here again (our third stay), and really enjoyed it. The last time we were at this hotel was in October 2007. The hotel appears fully renovated now.
The staff is very warm, welcoming and helpful. The staff member assisting us at check-in was extremely friendly and personable. The room was very clean, and had a wonderful view of the harbor, Empire State Building, and the overall city. The room temperature could be controlled by us, and with the humidity in NY in July, we enjoyed the a/c. 
The hotel location is great, with subways A, C and E literally right around the corner. It's also within easy walking distance of Times Square (about ten blocks) and a little farther to the Empire State Building. I have also stayed at the hotel for business in the past, and will return for business and family vacations.

"“Nice Clean Stay” stayed at christmas 2009, I found a deal on expedia.ca . room was very small with a small bathroom (door closing 1 inch away from the basin). The room was very clean, and room service(housekeeping) was consistent, we got clean towels everyday and our sheets were changed. we had 2 small carry on suitcases which was good given the size of our room. there is so much to do in New York that we were not in the room to care too much about the size though. there was a desk and drawer. the bed was very comfortable.
IT was a nice stay overall and the LOCATION is Great. close to few different subway lines that we did not have to take a taxi anywhere we just took the trains. close to shopping only 2 blocks from a huge macy's and victoria's secret and all other shops, walking distance to Empire state building and time square.
Tick Tock Diner was fine, nothing too special but then again it is a diner. we didn't try the other restaurant. 
The lobby is very nice and impressive looking; specially during christmas time it has nice decorations. I booked through expedia.ca and was very happy with my choice. quick check in and they stored our bags until check in time, fast and hassle free check out.",BShafiee,2010-12-01,122005,2011-07-12,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Lots of positives and few negatives” I stayed 4 nights with my daughter on a trip to celebrate her 21st. Comfortable, clean room with 2 double beds, flat screen TV, wi fi etc. Good diner attached with sterile atmosphere. Very convenient for Maceys, Empire State, the Subway and the excellent Skylight Diner. Close to the Lincoln tunnel and got back to Newark airport from the hotel in only 20 minutes.The hotel was busy with lots of checking in and out going on but always felt safe, with staff on hand checking people coming and going in the lifts. My only grumble was luggage storage on check out- very slow to deposit and retrieve luggage and the porters demanded $1 per item to drop off and the same to collect which caused a few arguments with some guests. All in all an excellent hotel. Having stayed before in the Waldorf Astoria where I had a smaller room at huge cost, I will happily return to the New Yorker on my next visit.",MichaelB007,2011-07-01,122005,2011-07-11,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Safe, clean and great location!” We traveled with our 3 kids, aged 8,9,10 and were worried about getting a decent, clean hotel that was not too expensive but still felt safe in. But, we didn't have to worry as this hotel had all that plus was so close to some major attractions! Just 5 minutes to the Empire State Building and 10 minutes to Time Square. I was worried about bed bugs prior to coming to New York but the beds were completely fine. The rooms were cleaned beautifully and fresh crisp towels given. I was surprised by the comments on the small rooms, it's NYC so space is a premium. We were a bit tight for space but that is because we had 5 in our party and had 2 double beds and a cot but we managed just fine. Quick check-in, wifi in rooms, fantastic modern fitness centre with treadmills, elliptical machines and every weight machine imaginable. Tasty diner attached to hotel for a big meal in the morning to start the day. Large 24 hour pharmacy located right across the street which really came in handy. Rates reasonable. The lowest-priced hotel we could find that we felt met our needs for cleanliness, safety and proximity. The only reason I gave a 4 star rating vs a 5 star rating is because of 2 reasons. It is not a luxurious, fancy hotel. It is old and it looks it especially in the bathrooms but it's clean and secondly, the staff are a bit lax about checking your room card before you enter the elevators. Probably other hotels don't even check but I wondered why they checked 60% of the time but let loads of people past whoe didn't show their cards. Other than that you can't go wrong staying here if you are looking for what we were! Have fun everyone! P.S. Take kids to F.A.O.

"“Fabulous and will be back!” Stayed here for 5 nights, and found NO problems whatsoever. We were checked in within 5 minutes of arriving by a lovely member of staff. We were on the 24th floor,with a view of the Empire State Building,and also the Chrysler Building. The room itself, a 2 double bedded room was plenty big enough, and luggage could be stored in the closet....so I don't understand people complaining about lack of space. Yes, the room was lovely, the beds are the most comfortable, and yes, the bathroom could do with a little renovation, but the shower, is sooooooo powerful, who cares? Didn't actually want to get out! Gift shop prices were cheaper than most of the shops in Times Square. We also ate at the Tick Tock Diner twice,once for dinner,and breakfast. It was okay, first night ,our server was rather miserable, but at breakfast, we had a really happy server. I would recommend checking out other places. If you like a big breakfast, try one of the many SBarro branches for a huge plate of eggs, bacon, sausages,potatoes,bread, french toast,ham,pancakes, etc.....yes,you can eat all of this for $8.49!!!! The hotel is,as many say very close to Macys etc, and Times Square(if you like walking) Subway just around the corner from the hotel, very easy to use. Do not pre book any tours!

"“Wonderful location, super clean, felt very safe” Found this hotel on hotwire.com--so didn't know what I was getting, but have had good luck booking 4 star hotels on hotwire in NYC--and that is what this one is listed as on hotwire. In any case, we had absolutely NO complaint about this place--loved that they checked for our room key before letting us into the elevator--made us feel safer. Liked being able to walk one block from Penn Station as we had taken the train in. Liked being able to catch the subway from Penn or the bus uptown outside the hotel. Hotel room seemed super clean. Fixtures in bathroom are older--but in perfect condition. New flat screen tv, great comfortable bed. Small room--but was expecting this after reading Trip Advisor. That wasn't an issue. Liked being able to go from the hotel lobby into the TickTock restaurant for a midnight request for a chocolate dessert, which we had in our room. Breakfast there was good, but also had breakfast and lunch at a nearby coffee shop--right next to the TGIF--where everything was fresh! I would recommend this place for a centrally located, convenient and clean hotel.",ChautauquaNY,2011-06-01,122005,2011-07-09,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Central, friendly hotel.” Myself and my friend stayed at the Newyorker for 5 nights, we flew straight from Vegas where we had been in the lap of luxury so I was dubious about staying 3 star. I had read a lot of reviews on TA about how small the rooms were and this was my main concern. 
Check in was easy, its worth taking a credit card specifically for giving hotels for incidentals. The elevators are well guarded by security staff, this made.me feel very safe. 
The room had 2 queens, a flat screen, 2 wardrobes, a walk in closet and a desk. The bathroom was small but this is New York afterall. 
Room was very clean and the beds were so so comfy. The subway is just outside the door, get a 7 day pass for better value. 
The diner in the hotel is great, head up to Alpha on 34th and 9th. The food is amazing and excellent value (sushi, noodles, amazing Thai curry) 
The staff were all quite short and Sharp.but they did give us an extra hour in our room for.free.

"“Great Hotel” We stayed at this hotel with friends in June. It was an older hotel with lots of charm. Rooms are not very big but okay for us ,after all you don't want to sit in your room when in New York. Beds are great and so is the location. Just a couple of blocks from Times Square and a few minutes walk to all attractions. Quiet rooms. would recommend to friends.

"“Great Location, small room” Stayed at The New Yorker late June 2011 once for three nights and a week later for one night, and as other have said the rooms are small, very small, but to be in the middle of New York and at the rates we paid, it was more than acceptable for us.
The first stay room of three nights was quite and no outside noise, the second stay, one night, outside air conditioning vent noise permiated the room and needed ear plugs to allow sleep. The in room air conditioners were noisy both stays, but as the evenings were coolish we turned these off so no noise trouble here, however if the weather is hot, the in room air conditioner noise would be a problem.
Check in quick and friendly as was check out on both occasions. No bellmen to assist with luggage when we checked in and out, but they are there and will assist if asked.
The hotel is showing its age and is in need of renovation and whilst I understand there have been renovations over the years parts of the hotel look like it is in the 1930's. The hallways need painting, the carpets threadbare and shabby.
Even though we paid for a view room on both occasions we got little more than glimpses of buildings from very small windows.
On the second occasion (one night) we booked the breakfast package, this turned out to be a voucher for tea/coffee/juice and toast/bagel/muffin etc, anything more you had to pay for. Not worth the $15.00 extra we paid. Better value at the surrounding eateries. 
If you want to leave luggage there is a cost of one dollar per item (plus obligatory tip), however on both occassions we left baggage we spent 15 minutes in a queue just to leave the bags and then another 15 minutes to pick them up.
The hotel is alive with people and good to see security checking room keys so only guests can get to the room floors.
All up a well sited hotel and close to many of New Yorks attractions and if you don't mind small rooms this hotel will suit. Just gets a reccomendation from ourselves and would stay again if we find ourselves in New York.",WizardMelbourne,2011-06-01,122005,2011-07-07,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Very happy positive stay.
The Tick Tock cafe is horrible and greasy, but they know everyone is going to eat there because its part of the hotel.

"“Great Location” This hotel is in a great location close to loads of amenities and access to attractions and transport. Walking distant from Penn Station. Great Diner and Bar linked to hotel. Rooms although small and dated are clean and air conditioned but do provide value for money. Free Wi-Fi but can be slow, you can pay for a faster connection. If you catch the NYAS bus, it is not as frequent as NYC and instructions are poor as you have to book the pick up in advance but you are not advised, hence we waited over an hour for the next one.

"“Great stay and would recommened” We stayed at the New Yorker for 7 nights in March 2011 and had a fantastic stay. I was very wary of what to expect after reading mixed reviews on here about the rooms being small, rooms a bit dated and bed bugs. But I was wrong!!
We flew into JFK and caught a cab straight to the hotel (flat rate of $45, plus tolls and tip). Concierge at hotel helped us with luggage and showed us to the reception desk for check in. 
We were seen to straight away and given the most amazing room ever. They took details of a credit card for any damages and you can use it to charge any extras from your room.
Our room was on the 36th floor, and a decent size the bed was sooo comfy and great for flopping on after being on our feet all day. We had a built in cupboard, which had an iron & ironing board and plenty of clothes hanging space and room for our two cases. There was also a tv, set of drawers and a desk. And we still had loads of room to move about.
Theres free wifi available in the room which was handy for us as we booked all our tickets for ESB, Top of the rock, circle line, Madame Tussauds etc. 
Only thing was the computer room with printer was out of order, so we emailed everything to Staples which is across the road and it cost like 10 cents or something. 
The bathroom was a little small and not very modern but it didn’t bother us and we weren’t there to sit in our room. 
The view couldn’t of been any better we looked straight onto the ESB, with Madison Square Gardens and the Brooklyn Bridge in the distance on the right and Metlife, Chrysler Building and the lights of Times Square on the left. We slept with the curtains open every night to enjoy the view to the full. It was AMAZING!!!!
Housekeeping changed towels everyday and also you just had to put a little sign on the bed for the sheets to be changed. 
The staff in which we spoke to were all friendly and helpful, they have security just before the lifts checking room keys of everyone which made us feel safe. I asked for a fridge, coffee maker and extra pillows which were brung up straight away without any hassle.
Location is perfect, 15-20 min walk to Times Square and about 5 mins straight to the ESB, Macys, Victoria’s Secrets and other shops. Cabs aren’t too expensive to help you get around the city. 
You have to pay to leave your cases/bags at the hotel on day of check out if you have a later flight. Think it was a 50 cents each bag to put them in and then 50 cents to get them back out again…..something like that and didn’t break the bank. 
We defiantly would recommend this hotel as it was good value for money and we genuinely enjoyed our stay. :)",KimF2708,2011-03-01,122005,2011-07-05,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great location, disappointing service” I have used Trip Advisor several times in the past to read reviews however this is the only time I have felt compelled to post a review myself. 
This was my first visit to New York however my first impression of the city was spoiled slightly by the unfriendly welcome I received upon arrival at the hotel. The staff member made no effort to interact, the only conversation he made was to ask for a $225 deposit and give the room number. This was disappointing after such a long trip.
I interacted with several reception staff members during my stay when accessing my safety deposit box and all shared this unfriendly attitude. I have to say that I was made to feel like an inconvenience - no one showed the friendly attitude I would expect from people working in the hospitality industry. 
I think the attitude of the staff can be summed up by this point - one of the reception staff members was applying lip gloss while a guest was trying to make an enquiry - totally uninterested!! 
The staff in the Tik Tok diner on the other hand were very pleasant and helpful - a far cry from the hotel staff. 
The room was small but it was clean and well kept. However the bathroom was not of such a good standard - there was paint flaking off the wall in the shower.
Overall the hotel facilities were in line with what I expected based on the price; and the location was ideal for visiting all of the major tourist attractions however I would choose a different hotel if visiting New York again and would not recommend it to others based on the customer service.",LauraW87,2011-06-01,122005,2011-07-05,False,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Fine hotel for NYC, but too busy for me” My mom and I stayed at the New Yorker for a night for a quick, last minute trip to NYC to enjoy the 4th of July. We got a great deal so decided to try it. The hotel was fine and yes, the room was tiny but clean. It's a very busy hotel and don't expect to check in early. Complimentary wi-fi was nice though. We also had a good cheap meal at the tick tock diner downstairs. Location is busy and noisy because of the train station and bus stops, but I liked being so close to Macy's. I probably wouldn't stay here again just because it's too touristy and busy (there are actually 'quieter' hotels in NYC) but it was fine for one night.",travels4jen,2011-07-01,122005,2011-07-05,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Second visit, still doesn't dissapoint” The biggest complaint I have seen online about the New Yorker is that the rooms are small. Guess what, the rooms are small. In my opinion however the New Yorker is a terrific VALUE placing you right by the Lincoln tunnel making this an EASY hotel to get to by car. Parking is expensive (its New York) but the Valet service is excellent. I have used both the Valet service and the parking lot next door and have had zero problems. We stay in the Metro rooms which are less expensive than the larger rooms but are small. Thats ok... you just came all the way to New York, the best part of the city is not in the hotel. 
You are just a five minute cab ride to the theatre district and a 15 minute walk to Times Square. Pick up a New York pass if you're staying more than a day and enjoy entrance to over 50 other attractions including the Empire State Building, NBC Tour, Top of the Rock, New York Metropolitan Art Gallery and way more.
My only complaint about this hotel was about the restaurant connected with it (Coopers) This place was beyond a joke, which is obvious by their lack of customers at peak times.

"“1 star hotel, with loads of attitude” Hi , I'm Manu Grover from India. stayed at new York hotel for the worst 3 nights of our stay from the 11 th to 14th June 2011
We are a family of 4,  with 2 kids 13 & 9. We have a regular room & requested for an upgrade & finally took a PAID upgrade to a suite, to be more comfortable. On checking IN, we realized , that it's a twin queen bed , with a pull out bed in adjoining room . i Requested for a king bed, they didn't have 1. 
As we were prepaid thru hot-wire, without cancellations, we couldn't throw away 1000 usd, so continued to stay & it just got worse.
Brief issues,
1. The bathroom of the hotel suite was 20 years old design.
2. They have 2,  max 3 people, at front desk,  for check in - check out all guest service queries,  for a 550 room hotel, so be ready to wait for 5 to 15 minutes, to operate your locker at the lobby, YES they didn't even have a IN room safes in a suite.
3. They did not have a tea or coffee maker in suite. 
4. Requested for a DVD player  for the kids, guess what, they didn't have it.
5. This will surprise you the most, my wife want a spoon to have medicine, they refused that,, as we did not order in room service,  they asked us to come down to the lobby & take it from the restaurant, for 0.50 usd, yes 0.50 usd.  I had to go down & across the street to get it from mcdonalds, free of charge, without any order or charge.
So now I was crossed & couldn't contain myself, so went up to the night front desk officer ,& asked him how is that hotels do not provide , spoons , If called for, he said, they didn't have in house restaurants, the restaurant at lobby is 3rd party, WOW, so housekeeping can't keep spoons.  Then I asked him, u do not even give tea & coffee maker in the room, ( they only provide in suites,),  so he jumped to the conclusion, that i'm living in a regular room & guess what he said,  we do have them, only if u living  in a suite, SIR, are u staying in 1, .
Too his bloody wrong conclusion, I was living in one, so I had told him yes I am & then he asked for my room no. To check.  ATTITUDE of a 7 star, with ZERO courtesy , leave hospitality.
Next morning, I operated the locker after waiting for 7 mins in the queue, & meet the same lady who checked me in, she asked , so how was the room. I told her not up any mark for a suite & then shared all my above experience with her, she said, I should speak to manager & give a feedback, I Told her, I rather do it online.
Basic courtesy & procedure would be,a negative feedback is reported & someone makes a courtsey call to checkup on the incident & do assessment & damage control, with the guest. NO one called, so I guess, they don't care.
It doesn't get over here, it's just getting warmed up & u really wanna read this.
They charge me  twice for the paid upgrade & it said 11th 50 us dollar & then 11 th 50 usd & so on for the next 2 night, there were these 6 or just 1 more entry on the bill, so could have been caught by a DODO, why they couldn't is beyond me. 
Then I asked the lady for the double charge, she looked at me, as if I'm crazy & took a good 5 minutes on her computer to verify & understand what happened.  So after waiting  for next 5 minutes she corrected the bill & I asked her I want the old overcharged bill & she looked so bewildered , as if I asked something out of this world& she argued , why I need it , after the corected one, has been made out.
So I explained all that  you read above sonfar & it's my right to get that copy, she finally relented & said, she need to check with her manager, WHAT? A MANAGER , to give me a copy of the wrongly raised bill. He came back & want to understand , why was been uptight, so I said I wanted to post it online, he gave me his card & said if u ever come to NY, to write to him & he will take care of us & I said, even if u give a free stay, I rather not stay & left.
& now the kicker.
I had to pick up a car rental from new jersey , north Bergen, 6 miles from. The hotel, the doorman said it'll be 60 usd + toll,  in the hotel car.  I said, I'll take a taxi, there were 4 pre parked, yellow cabs , standing outside the gate.
He took me there, with the luggage cart & explained me it's in NJ & NY taxi's don't go there. The taxi driver all asked for exactly the same amount 60 + toll , so I said it's 6 mile & it should be 30 pr 35 usd,  & i'll pay by the meter + toll & he says sir, I think the best would be u take your luggage &  take the subway, you save the money, instead of helping me hail a street taxi to my satisfaction.
I hail a street taxi myself,  same yellow cabs & the taxi driver took out a book with publish flat rate , which is the max & it said 28 + 8 for the toll, so the doorman got agitated & asked the taxi driver that why did he pull, in front of the hotel & to go from them, SO MUCH FOR GUEST ASSISTANCE.
I finally shouted at him & said, I am a guest of the hotel & he is entitled to pick me up from the hotel curb side,whelks there are 4 yellow cab taxi's parked to pick up the guests. 
& guess what did he do......
He then  took our luggage from the luggage cart & dumped it on the roadside, inspite our kids,, stranding us there on the road side, 
I put the luggage in the taxi , myself & went to the hotel manager & explained what just happened & why is said what I said, but declining even a free stay, & here's  a live example of the attitude the hotel staff throws around. He was trying to pacify me & tell me what will the doorman gain & taxi would be make the money & also they should go by the meter by law & so I took him the taxi on the curbside, to confirm all that from the taxi driver. (& I showed him the picture it took of the bag the doorman, dumped on the curbside .)
So BTW, doesn't the manager know , the kick back 10 to 15 usd, cut the door man would have made from his yellow cab friends allowed to be parked outside the hotel 
The yellow cab, who were pre parked & asked for 60 bucks too, shook hands with the duty manager & to my utter disbelief, I shook & head & simply drove off. 
As I suddenly realized, why the hotel is what it is, All are hand in glove , including the manager , yes to be sure, that the top managements , knows about this , I will write to them as well.
SO STAY AWAY, EVEN IF IT'S FREE.
WOW what an experience, well my kids got the education of a lifetime for sure.
Thanks

"“Holiday of a Lifetime” The trip was a celebration for my 50th birthday. Having never been to USA before was filled with trepidation. This evaporated on arrival at the New Yorker (tbh a few days before as my wife had emailed them telling them the purpose of the trip). Our room had been upgraded to one with a view. Every morning on opening the curtains I had to look at the Empire State Building and every night closing them looking at the differently coloured lights at the top.
The staff were very welcoming and room service was excellent. We had a visit one afternoon and the lady saw us drinking coffee from McD's across the road. Within the hour we were provided with a coffee maker and the following day a tea maker as well.
The hotel was situated in a perfect spot for us, across from a subway station (sorry NYC not as good as London Underground) so we could get about easily as well as the sights that were in easy walking distance.
I had read reviews about the tick tock diner and was worried about the service we might receive if we went. As part of our upgrade we were given vouchers for a free breakfast so we used them on our first morning. The service was excellent and the portions were more than adequate. It might be argued that it was for free so it would be okay. It was just the same when we paid for it on our last morning. The only reason we dined there twice was to sample other places.
All in all an excellent experience at this hotel. I would recommend it to others and would return there again if I can be persuaded to stay on a plane for eight hours again",971boy,2011-06-01,122005,2011-07-02,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent Hotel in Prime Location” We stayed for 5 nights in June. The location of the hotel was ideal being just a block away from Penn Station (We flew into Newark and took the NJ Transit train to Penn). The hotel is only a 10 minute walk to Times Square. Our room (on the 34th floor) was spacious and clean. The reception staff were always polite and helpful. Checking in and out was fast and efficient. We took breakfast in the Tick Tock Diner (part of the hotel) which was good value. There are plenty excellent bars / eateries within the vicinity of the hotel.
We would definitely return to the New Yorker and have no hesitation in recommending it.",jcrichton,2011-06-01,122005,2011-07-02,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

What more can you ask for in NYC. Lot of eating option all around the hotel. Most of the tours start right next to the hotel Macys', JC Penny and H&M are all next door.

So I had to climb over my wife to get in and out of bed but I must say the bed was comfortable.

"“Good in some ways” The New Yorker hotel is a good choice to stay at in NYC mainly because of these two factors:
Location as close as you can get to everywhere in NYC, unless you live in a 5 star hotel.
Price: About 2200 dollars for one week for three persons (double room)
Also, the staff is friendly and smiling. The rooms are clean.
Do not stay here if you are seeking a hotel that has large, good looking rooms and nice supplementaries. 
The rooms are small, and are close to tacky. So is the reception. It is an old, grey, big building. Shower is nothing but OK.
Also, as mentioned by someone before, it is a large hotel with 550+ rooms, and only 2-4 receptionits. Thing might take some time.
I enjoyed my stay in NYC, but not because of the hotel. Only location wise.",Eztini,2011-06-01,122005,2011-06-29,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great hotel in an ideal location” Visited new york for 4 nights as a treat from my partner for my 40th birthday. After reading lots of reviews on here I was able to plan quite a bit of our trip beforehand and I will include the most helpful bits in my review. Travelling from newark airport couldn't be easier, just follow the signs and up a couple of escalators onto the airtrain which takes you directly to newark station where easy you will find an easy to use ticket machine and for $12.50 each your on your way.
About 25 mins later you arrive at NY penn station, directly up the steps look to your right and there is the New Yorker hotel.
We arrived around 2.pm and our room was not ready which was fine by us as we needed a drink and was told by the friendly receptionist our room would be worth the wait...how right she was! An hour later we checked in to a room on the 37th floor with the most amazing view of the Empire State biulding, 2 double beds the most comfortable ive slept in on holiday, ample wardrobe space and yes bathroom is on the small side but so what !!
We used the tick tock diner on a few occasions which was very convenient, we also used the bar attached to the hotel for a few drinks at the end of very tiring days.
To get around NY i recommend city sights tours, there is a guy posiotioned outside the hotel in a yellow t-shirt, for $87 dollars each we got hop on/off bus travel, night tour of brooklyn, boat to liberty island, 90 ny harbour tour, entrance to the 86th floor obsevatory of the empire state and entrance to a number of museums all included, great value!!
Recommend seeing a show of any sort, for great value tickets just queue up at the ticket outlet in Times square around 2.30pm and by 3.15 you will have 40/50% discounted tickets for a show that night.
Concierge in Hotel was very helpful and always on hand, she arranged our transport back to Newark at short notice no problem.
Would definately return to NY and would only stop in the New yorker !!",shaggyboy1971,2011-05-01,122005,2011-06-29,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

It was raining and we were all soaked wet and cold, I was 3 months pregnant I asked if I could pay to use a room a room to shower or just change. They refused telling me to change in the toilets. They did not care nor show any understanding. I am grown woman and did not want to get changed in a toilet.how unhygienic. Very disappointed

"“Central location but no wow factor” My husband and i stayed here for 4 nights at the end of our multi centre USA trip. We flew into Newark airport and the cab cost to the hotel was $70 including tolls which we found slightly excessive. May be cheaper if you fly into JFK. The hotel location is great, very central, Penn St station right next door, Madison Square Gardens opposite and only a 10 minute walk to Times Square. We arrived at reception check in at 8.30pm so there was no queue, very desirable after travelling for so long. The lobby is very art deco, and has very much kept the 1930's feel to it. The staff were friendly and helpful, so no complaints there. Before arriving, i had emailed the hotel a few weeks before as it was my 30th birthday whilst staying there and wanted to see if i could have a high floored room overlooking the city. The guy at check in acknowledged my email and said he had found me the perfect room and wished me a very happy birthday and hope we liked it. However, although the room was on the 33rd floor, the view was actually of another high rise apartment block directly opposite. Very disappointing :(
We found the rooms to be extremely small. I know everyone on here is saying you don't sit in your rooms all day but we had 1 double bed and between the bed and the desk, there was only enough room for one person to be standing next to it at one time. When i brought my shopping bags back, we had no hope! Although we didn't see them, the general view appears to be that the 2 double rooms have more space to move around so i would recommend choosing one of those.
The facilities included a gym, 2 restaurants and a business centre which was useful for your return flight check in and keeping up to date with the social networking sights :) The charge for use was 25c a minute. My husband managed to log into the hotel Wi-Fi on his phone from our room, which didn't appear to charge him. Was free for 1 day. We ate in the Tick Tock diner twice which was fairly reasonable. Also being open 24 hrs a day means there no rush to eat at set times. I would recommend trying Nutella on French toast with banana which i had for breakfast on the last day there, was delicious! Overall, the hotel was ok, no major hassles with anything but that's all i can say. I suppose i was expecting more due to the previous reviews on here. 
Make sure you visit Liberty Island but if you want to get in the Crown or Pedestal for the views, you will need to book in advance. We booked 3 months in advance but could only get to the Pedestal. This is still a great view across the city and Island though. The Empire State Building entrance fee was around $20 to get to the 86th floor, if you want to go right to the top, there's an extra fee but probably worth it to say you'd done it! Would recommend getting the audio tour as well, this gives you explanations and history as to the buildings you are looking at when your up there. Very interesting and informative! Central Park was amazing, absolutely huge and we found the bridge and hotel from Home Alone 2, definitely get some photo's of them if you can. Also, visit the M & M store in Times Square. It's a fun store and even the adults will turn into kids once inside :)
If we returned to New York, we'd probably choose another hotel but in a central location like this.",SJH27,2011-06-01,122005,2011-06-28,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Nice Hotel, Decent Location” My wife and I stayed at the New Yorker in June when we went for our first visit to New York on our first anniversary.
After reading mixed review's we were obviously slightly apprehensive, but found the New Yoker to be perfectly fine as our New York base. The room may not have had the best view of the city (looking at the building across the street on the 27th floor but it was nice and comfy and or a decent enough size (not as if you spend a huge amount of time in your room whilst your in NYC!!).
Bathroom was great with a decent shower. Only downside was the air-con which was a bit loud (according to the better half - personally I've slept through a hurricane so didn't notice a thing!).
Staff were extreemly pleasant at the hotel, the Tick Tock and the Bar. Plus the car service back to JFK was great!
Great location if your after Macy's or the Empire, plus you can wander up to Times Square in about 10mins but don't get all the noise.

At the edge of Chelsea and Midtown, this is perfectly located. Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating, and check-in was a breeze. Yes the hotel is a bit dated and the rooms are small.

"“great hotel in great position” The New Yorker is in a great midtown location. Take the metro from JFK ($8) or a train from Newark ($12.50) and get off at Penn Station. Your hotel will be just across the road. The check in staff are friendly and there is free safety deposit and luggage storage. The rooms have been recently renovated, the best and biggest being in the higher 'tower' floors. The bathrooms are a bit antiquated, but this is part of the charm of the place.

"“Would visit again” We spent three nights in this hotel as a stop-over on our way home from Ohio. The New Yorker is one of the oldest hotels in NYC and from the outside it rather looked the part but once inside it became obvious that the $70million refurbishment completed two or three years ago was designed to retain the original 1930's appearance. 
Check-in was brisk and efficient. Our room was on the 22nd floor at the back, so we did not have the super view of the Empire State Building. The room was small but still had two fitted wardrobes and ample drawer space. Bedlinen was crisp and very clean and the bed itself was larger than a standard UK double. The mattress was in excellent condition and I had some of the best sleeps in any hotel. Somewhat surprisingly, it was very quiet the three nights we were there.
The bathroom was small and fitted out very much in 30's style but all the fittings were relatively new, cleverly matched to their originals. Everything in the bathroom worked perfectly.,
A huge asset to this hotel is undoubtedly the Tick-Tock Diner on the ground floor. This is in the style of the classic American diner, all chrome, glass and laminate. The menu was extensive and the breakfasts were excellent, my first orange juice was almost a pint (16ozs). Huge portions, well cooked and presented with fast efficient service. In fact, we ended up having dinner there too, not finding much to our liking in the vicinity.
The New Yorker is ideally situated mid-town for all the usual tourist venues and is close to Penn. station. The 34th street subway is right outside the hotel
The Transportation Desk in the lobby will arrange a luxury car to any of the airports for a fixed fee equivalent to the taxi rate and for that will also check you in for your return flight. They will even print off your boarding cards the day before your departure . This is to be recommended because we were bumped off an internal flight earlier in the week because we did not check in until three hours before departure despite having prepaid reservations made a month earlier.
Some reviewers grumbled about the left baggage charge. It was a dollar to leave two heavy suitcases and a dollar to retrieve them. Not much for a ticketed service in a secure room.

"“old but charming” stayed here for one night, on june 10th, not my first choice, but it will be next time. it is a lovely old landmark, just around the corner from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. It is a bustling hotel, excellent staff with great attitude and very helpful. I asked for a room with a view, and that is what I got, 39th floor overlooking manhattan. the rooms are quite small, even just for me, but they are very well equipped, very clean. and comfortable.

"“Great Location...Just missing that 'something'...” We flew in to Newark (EWR), and got the train into New York Penn Station ($12.50 each way) which is across the road from the hotel. The location is absolutely fantastic, on the same street as empire state building, 5-10 mins from times square and theatreland, grayline office down the street, everything within walking distance, (if you dont mind walking, otherwise might be a bit far to a few sights like statue of liberty/wall street/battery park)
On entering the hotel our first thoughts were wow! The lobby is very art deco, and very inkeeping with that old new york. We were able to check in early which was a bonus, my only gripe would be that the check in staff didnt explain anything to us, hotel amenities etc.... The fact we had to hand over $220 as a deposit for incidentals was never mentioned on their website, and seeing as though we had paid in full with a credit card surely it was already on file...i think they could make this situation better..? This is a very busy hotel, with lots of people around all the time.
Our room was on the 22nd floor and was a metro queen room, it was very small, but this is New York and we were'nt expecting anything much bigger, and besides, we were only in the room to drop bags off, change and sleep, theres too much to do and see in the city the rest of the time! The room was very clean and actually quite modern with LCD TV etc, but having recently been updated you would probably expect that, however it seemed as though the bathroom had been missed out, by contrast it was at best dated, and a bit grotty in places, the towels are quite small too, but you do get toiletries.
The bed itself, was very comfortable, one of the best and was great for collapsing on at night after long days in NYC! The room was nice and quiet too, great for getting to sleep and being able to relax at night.
I thought it was good that they had security checking room cards before allowing people into the lifts, however the security deposit boxes were a bit strange in that we had to queue up at reception to gain access everytime, it just wasted a lot of time having to wait around for reception to let you in. 
The staff themselves were polite enough, but they just seemed to lack the ability to smile, and the majority of the time seemed like they just didnt want to be there.
We opted to eat at the tick tock diner one evening, and to be honest it wasnt the best food ive ever had, it was okay, nothing special and the staff again seemed like they just didnt want to be there - there are plenty of other great places to eat in new york, so i wouldnt waste your time in the tick tock and go try something authenic elsewhere!
Overall the location is great, in fact you'd struggle to beat it as its in the middle of everything you want to do, but the service leaves a little to be desired, just lacks that 'something' to make it great. I would definately stay here again for the location, but if it was service i was after i would try somewhere else.",CraigandKeely,2011-06-01,122005,2011-06-22,False,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“great hotel” On reading some of the reviews we are wondering if we stayed at the same hotel as, in our opinion, this hotel couldn't be faulted. Our room was spotless, clean towels every day (certainly big enough for us) and our bedding could have been changed on a daily basis if we required, plus the wardrobe/cupboard was large enough that we could store our suitcases in it. Clearly you won't find a hotel in New York that is near to all places of interest but this hotel was close to the majority. Also we had no issue with paying such a small amount to have our suitcases store securely after we had checked out and more fool you if you leave money in your room as there are free safe boxes in reception.

"“Great location, average service.” We stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights at the start of our honeymoon. The location is ideal, right opposite Madison Square Garden and only a short 5-10 minute walk to Time Square.
The room itself was pretty small (albeit we did only have a standard room) and the bathroom wasn't really up to modern standards with the shower being very difficult to get to a decent temperature. I would also say that the service was pretty average. For a hotel of that size they really should have more than 2-3 people on the check-in desk also our keycard kept malfunctioning, instead of being helpful or even apologetic the staff seemed more keen to point out to us why we may have broken it, not really the service I would expect.
With all that said the Tick Tock Diner is absolutely superb! Delicious food, friendly service and typically generous American size portions.

"“Unbeatable location... but poor rooms” The location is fantastic - across from Penn Station, and just 2 minutes' walk to the shops on 34th Street, including Macy's.
The hotel lobby is gorgeous, so I was very disappointed to find out that the rooms didn't quite match the expectations the lobby created, especially since I stayed at a cheaper and theoretically inferior hotel in NYC just a few weeks before, and found that experience to be better . 
The room I stayed in on the 32nd floor was quite small, and the carpet seemed somewhat dirty, which prompted me to walk around my room in shoes only. I could also hear the people in the adjacent room through the night, which is never good for your sleep. Regarding the bathroom, it was in keeping with the overall size of the room: small. In addition, the showercurtain was a bit grimy, and the toiletries available were certainly not what you would expect from such a costly hotel. The towels were also somewhat small.
Lastly, the free internet connection was very slow, and skype calls weren't very good: it costs $9.95 a day if you want a faster one.
Overall, great location, but certainly not worth the price you pay for the rooms you get.",theplane,2011-06-01,122005,2011-06-19,False,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Average” Convienantly placed, first room we were placed in had quite a few issues - 1 double bed altough requested 2 singles we were told they couldn't do anything because no other rooms were available, view of a wall, shower didn't work properly, loud noises coming from repairs being made above us (starting at 6am), problems with heating and window that didn't open made the room like a sauna and it was very small!! - made 3 complaints and we were eventually moved to a very nice room with a good view - manager was pleasant and helpful! Found some staff a little rude, but others friendly depended on the nationality. Didn't rate the diner too much - food was often poor. Can't say anything about the hotel was ""great"" but it was okay, probably paid a little over the odds for what we got. Was conviently placed near to times square and plenty of attractions to see.

“Good location very small rooms” This hotel has a good location and nice lobby but the rooms are so small. With two people and two suitcases it was hard to walk around. To get to the bathroom I had to walk on top of my suitcase. The room was old and dated. The bed was called a queen but it was more like a double. The hotel also charged to leave your suitcases for a few hours after checkout which I thought was unnessary. The location is convenient for sightseeing throughout the city.

The staff were attentive and very friendly. There was also vending machines for those of you wanting a late night snack or drink. all in all it was a good hotel the only thing i would complain about is that our sink leaked so we'd end up with a soaked bathroom floor after cleaning teeth or washing. I also didnt like the fact they took money out of my account, i understand having a credit card on file but actually taking over $300 out and then having to wait up to 10 working days after our departure to get it back.....which ended up taking well over 2 weeks after chasing them up about it. if they felt we had broken/damaged or taken something they should take the money afterwards not before hand.",VickyandAdam88,2011-01-01,122005,2011-06-15,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Clean,ok location but watch your money” The New Yorker was a nice hotel in a touristy part of town but I will not stay there again for a few reasons:
1. Money was stolen from my pants laying on the ground and the New Yorker did nothing about except offer me a free night on my next multi-night stay. I would have rather had my $40 back instead of having to spend more money on a hotel that won't admit fault to recoup my losses. You would think they would credit me $40 after spending almost $1,400 on the room
2. The location is good with regards to getting around but the area has all the touristy shops that you can find in any mall in the US. We were hoping for a better area with more unique stores. We were mislead by the ""fashion ave"" location. Although the Macy's is very cool ""Miracle on 34th st"" location.
3. The room I stayed in was very small for the money but kind of expected since it is New York City.
The hotel is very clean and kept up well but I would prefer to stay somewhere else. If you choose to stay here, eat at the Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel.

"“Our Second Time Back” We enjoyed our last stay at the New Yorker that we decided to stay again.
After our participation at the Boston Marathon, we decided to have a stopover in New York before heading home. Even though, we enjoyed our last stay at the New Yorker, we decided to try something different. After some extensive research, we realized for the price and the location, we couldn't find anything better.
Walking distance to Times Square, Empire State Building and Macy's. Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens is only a block away.
It's an older hotel so don't expect the big rooms with granite vanities. The basic rooms are small. Because my husband and I are small people, it didn't affect us. If you want more space, you would have to pay the extra for a suite.
The 24-hour Tick Tock Diner (located within the building) serves up great food and excellent service. We each had a large breakfast for under $25.00 total and it lasted us through the whole day. They have an excellent espresso.
Cooper's Tavern was also located within the building but we didn't try it out. We did have a drink there waiting for the shuttle to take us to the airport. After looking around and seeing the food being consumed, I wish we had.
You can't beat the location. A $29.00 Metro Card card gave us 7-Day Unlimited Pass to the subway and bus. There is a station right outside the hotel. With Penn Station across the street, you can catch most lines and the Amtrak.

"“A fantastic hotel, steeped in heritage.” I recently stayed at the New Yorker hotel with a friend on a 5 day trip to New York.
We arrived to find the reception busy, as it was at most times of the day, but the staff were quick and efficient in seeing to us and we were checked in swiftly.
We were allocated a room on the 20th floor and unfortunately, you won't get much of a view at this height, but if you come to New York to sit in a hotel room, you are in the wrong city. 
The room was a double double, sorted out for us by Kelvin, with two large double beds and two bathrooms, which was a bonus. It was very nicely laid out and very clean and I'm glad to say it wasn't decked out in an ultra modern style, it's an old hotel with a history, so it would not have been right for an ultra modern interior.
I have seen some reviews commenting on the bathroom needing to be updated, but I found the bathrooms to be just right, with some original features still intact from when the hotel was built. I would be appalled if these were replaced.
The hot water in the shower was a tad changeable, in that it could go cold for a second or two then return to normal. I just put this down to be it being an old building, certainly not worth complaining about.
My only complaint about the room is that there is no safe, I have an expensive camera and although the hotel do provide safety deposit boxes at the reception area, my camera was too large for it and would have liked to manage my money and passport etc from my room. However, the safety deposit boxes are very secure and have to be opened by both you and a hotel employee using two keys.
Attached to the hotel you have two eating establishments, the Tick Tock Diner and Coopers Tavern. I will review them separately.
Tick Tock diner - A very busy, classic American Diner, I visited twice at different times and both times it was packed, but I was seated quickly and the service was very quick. The portions are massive, so bring your appetite and I would recommend the omlettes.
Coopers Tavern - This kind of became my local in New York, pefect for popping in for a quick pint after a hard day sightseeing or shopping. I could not fault the staff of Coopers, especially Marina who was brilliant behind the bar, remembered me after one visit and was always helpful and pleasant.
It's not the cheapest place in NYC, but it's certainly not the most expensive. I ate here once and got a burger stack, it was huge, and very nice.
On leaving the hotel, we were checked out with little fuss and the staff were as efficient as when we arrived and wished us a safe trip.
We required a car for the airport and the transportation desk sorted one out for us with little fuss, I didn't get the tall guy who dealt with us name, but he was very good. Our car was there when we needed it and it saved us having to bother about cabs, tolls, tips etc as it was all included in the $75 fee.
We left our bags in the hotel and nipped to Coopers for a beer before getting the Lincoln Towncar to JFK.
All in all, we had a brilliant stay at the New Yorker, there was a review which stated the area might not be safe around the hotel, but we found this to be not right as we were out and about at all hours and never once felt uneasy.
I will be returning to NYC next March and I will definitely book with the New Yorker again, you simply cannot get a better location.

"“Very central” Hi
We stayed at the New Yorker for 4 nights early June 2011. Our TC sent room requests on our behalf for a high floor with great views 
When we arrived our room was not ready and we had a wait if over four hours prior to being assigned a room on the 34th floor. Check in time was advertised as 2pm and we eventually got into our room at 6pm. This was the only bad experience we had. 
The room was small but entirely functional & well maintained 
The location is great. An easy walk to times square etc and a short step to Penn Station. We easily walked from the hotel to Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State Building, Times Square, Chrysler Building, Wall St, ""Ground Zero"", Russian Tea Rooms and Central Park 
Highly recommend this hotel for a budget perfectly located stay in NYC!

"“Great hotel, great location.” The New Yorker is still under rennovation, but the work does not interfere with guests. Our room on the 19th floor was large with 2 bathrooms, TV, coffee maker, iron and iron board. and lots of wardrobe and drawer space. New furniture and beds all in the art deco style added to the rooms ambience and is in keeping with the building.
The hotel only has the Tick Tock diner and the Tavern for meals, I dont think Room Service is available and we moved our own luggage. We ate in both the diner and the tavern and both provided good food at a reasonable price with good service.
The hotel is very well situated being within easy walk of 2 subway stations, the Empire State, Madison Square Garden and Times Square.

"“Great hotel for us (only check in a negative)” Myself and my son (aged 10) had a double double room at the New Yorker for our recent trip (May 24th to 29th). For us, the location of the hotel was perfect, easy for subway access around the city, as well as easy access to the NJT and airtrain back to Newark at the end of our stay (wish we had stuck to using it on the way in now instead of getting a car!). 
We liked the location of the hotel, easy access, about 10 to 15 mins stroll to Times Square, plenty of shops etc. We arrived in the middle of the day, check in was somewhat slow and I have to say that I was disappointed with the person we checked in with and there was unfortunately no ""warm welcome"", just as when we checked out they didn't even bother to ask if we had enjoyed our stay or if anything had been ok. When we wanted to gain access to our security deposit box, we were made to feel as if it were a bother to the staff on reception. Thankfully, this was the only downsides of our stay, and thankfully, we didn't have to encounter the staff on reception that often.
Everyone else we came into contact with, housekeeping, security etc were all very nice and friendly.
We had a double double room which was upgraded prior to our arrival to one of the newly refurbished New Yorker rooms, although if we had wanted a room with a view it would have been an additional $30 a night. We didnt bother paying this as it had already cost us a lot of money, and it wouldn't have been worth it for the length of time that we stayed in the room.
Our room itself was spacious (certainly bigger than a lot of other places we've stayed) and it had 2 bathrooms, both with bath and shower over. We liked the fact we could each take a bath at the same time. The room was clean, tidy and very comfortable. The beds were some of the comfiest we have ever slept in, (even if they were a long way from the floor ~ sounds strange but this was the first time if I sat on the end of the bed that my feet wouldn't touch the floor lol) but it was incredibly comfortable, clean crisp sheets and covers, 4 thick but lovely pillows. Plenty of towels (changed daily even if you followed the cards in the room about saving laundry). TV, alarm clock, ice bucket etc, we had a view of inside of the tower, but it meant it was somewhat quieter and didn't bother us.
We would recommend the hotel to other people staying, we enjoyed the location, the ease of where it was to other places, and also enjoyed the Skylight diner a couple of times just down the road (found it preferable in quality and value to the Tick Tock Diner attached to the hotel), able to use the business centre to print off our boarding passes for the 2nd half of our trip which was useful and the free internet wifi was good with no downtimes or slow use.
All in all, we enjoyed our stay here, the only negative was the reception given from the reception staff and the fact that they didn't make you feel particularly welcome.",UKtop_kat,2011-05-01,122005,2011-06-10,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Brilliant” I had read many reviews of this Hotel, many were favourable but a few made me slightly apprehensive - upon arrival and a swift check-in the apprehension was no more, we requested through our travel agent a twin-room (two seperate beds), the room we were initially given had a one double bed. I went back down to reception and explained the original request and we were immediately provided with a two bed room on the 19th floor - perfect ! All the staff were all too willing to help and very polite in the process - my only complaint was the quickness of service and poor attitude at thet the concierge desk, after waiting for an hour for what I was hoping would be a quick and helpful reply when I said how long I had been waiting she said ""you could have interrupted, you didn'y have to wait"" - what would other guests have thought if I had barged through the queue ?
Our room was very comfortable and the hosekeeping very prompt when we had an issue with an overflowing bathroom facility. The subway at 34th Penn Station has entrances next to the hotel and the hop-on hop-off tourist buses are just one block away.
The Tick-Tock Diner next door is fabulous - fully recommended.",B-HNL,2011-05-01,122005,2011-06-10,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Absolutely fabulous and great location!!” I took my boyfriend for his 21st birthday and pictures of the hotel did no justice! I emailed prior to my arrival explaining it was a surprise visit and they upgraded my room to a large room free of charge and with a great city view!! Was in a great location easy to walk pretty much everywhere and was very close to times square!! It was my first time in new York so wasn't sure where the hotel was etc but was amazing! Very clean and the staff was very helpful! Would definitely stay there on my next visit as it's very good value! You would never think it is a 3 star since it has been refurbished! Only ate once in the tick tock diner and only had a desert! But only because we wanted to experience other places all over! Alot of my friends who have been or are going are using this hotel so is very popular!!,Laura3119,2011-03-01,122005,2011-06-10,True,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Location and Value” Stayed here for three nights with my adult daughter and was very impressed with its value. The room was a decent size and its view excellent. However, the bathroom was quite small and outdated and needing some attention but was clean. The staff at check-in was very courteous and helpful. The hotel's location was perfect for us and really central to most everyhting. In previous stays in New York, we have traditionally stayed in TIme Square but found this location much better and easier to travel from. Walking distance to many places and public transportation is just around the corner.
I would not recommend the Tick Tock Diner. We had horrible service, and just mediocre food. It took us over 45 minutes to get a simple egg breakfast and that was after trying to get our waiter's attention for almost 15 minutes to no avail.",Melanie513,2011-02-01,122005,2011-06-08,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Loved the location” My family of 4 stayed at this hotel using my husband's hotel points. We originally had a 2 double bedroom booked, but then I realized, I wanted my own space from the kids. We upgraded to a ""New Yorker Suite"" which consisted of a queen sized bedroom, separate from a living room with a pull-out couch bed. The kids got the couch bed and we got our own room. When we upgraded to the suite, a continental breakfast was included on the 39th floor with the most AMAZING views. It was well worth the upgrade which cost us an additional $80+tax each night. The continental breakfast is not available on weekends, so we were provided a ticket for each of us for Saturday and Sunday to get breakfast at the Tick Tock Diner which is connected to the hotel off of the lobby. That place had good food, fast service and they give you a ton of food. Great way to save money while eatting out in NYC.
We had a room on the 38th floor facing The Empire State Building. If we go back, I'll ask for a room over the Hudson. Nothing wrong with our view, but after seeing the sites from the breakfast room upstairs, I think I'd prefer the Hudson. Just a personal choice really. The location of the hotel on the corner of 34th Street and 8th Avenue was perfect if you are coming by train into Penn Station. It's right there, across the street. No taxi's necessary. We were a 10 min. walk to Time Square, we walked to 6oth Street between 2nd & 3rd Avenues to Serendipity 3 Restaurant. It took us probably an hour, of course we were walking with 2 young children too. We walked everywhere. We did take a taxi to the Staton Island Ferry, then walked through the Financial District, up through Chinatown and Little Italy. Stopping at the Peanut Butter & Co. Restaurant, then walked up to a park on the next block. We did take a cab home after that excusion, but really, The New Yorker Hotel is in close proximity to everything. The room we stayed in was recently remodeled and had marble floors in the bathroom. The room came complete with a Keurig for coffee or tea and a small refrigerator to store water or whatever you needed in there.

"“Great hotel, friendly staff - would come here again.” I stayed here with a friend on a recent birthday trip to New York. I have to say i was very impressed with the service we received from the moment we arrived. The staff were not intrusive at all but were friendly and helpful when asked for help or advice, particularly Laura at the front desk who on our arrival upgraded us to a room with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building on the 31st floor due to it being a special 50th birthday trip for me. And the gift of truffles was a lovely touch!. At one point the bulb in the bathroom light blew and a technician came to the room almost immediately, which was impressive. The security in the hotel was reassuring.
The room itself was extremely clean on arrival and was kept spotless by housekeeping staff throughout our stay, as was the bathroom. The shower took a little getting used to - the adjusting of the temperature took a little patience - but this is mere nitpicking to be honest. And to those worried about bed bugs, i can honestly say my friend and I did not have one bite between us!!!! The beds were clean and extremely comfortable. 
The housekeeping staff always had a friendly word when we bumped into them too.
The room was close to the lifts but was actually surprisingly quiet and being so high up you can barely hear any street sounds (maybe the odd siren).
There was also a decent, not too expensive gift shop downstairs from the foyer for last minute gifts, and the tick tock diner was handy for a reasonably priced breakfast before a long day of sightseeing!
The location of the hotel couldn't be better really - right in midtown. Most places were walkable, with good comfortable shoes and there are plenty of reasonably priced cafes and restaurants nearby. 
For a break in New York i can thoroughly recommend this hotel to travellers.",jillt99,2011-05-01,122005,2011-06-06,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Ana who checked us in was very welcoming and also provided us with a coffee maker and pods for our stay. After reading reviews on here I was expecting a small room but ours was large with a bath and shower and a large closet. We ate breakfast and had coffee in the Tick Tock diner and our waitress was lovely plenty of coffee refills and attentive although the first lady as we entered and asked to be seated was brusque and wanted to seat us in the middle of the diner, despite the diner being empty. I had read about the attitude on here and stuck to our guns to get a better table. The location of the hotel was perfect for us right next to a subway entrance which made it very easy for us to get to all the places we wanted and use the airtrain to get to and from JFK.

"“Definitely would go back” I have just got back from New York, and stayed at the New Yorker Hotel with my daughter. One word.. Amazing. The hotel was in a perfect location with the Empire State buiding 1 block away, Central Park within walking distance along with Time Square. 
I was on the 33rd floor and upon checking-in, was unsure. When I entered my room I was pleasantly surprised. Although our hotel was on the 33rd floor, we had perfect views of the Hudson River and bearing in mind every building is 33+ floors high had to settle. The staff were very polite and helpful at all times and gave us good advice for touring in the City. The rooms were emaculate. 
The hotel provides room service so after a hard day out shopping, sightseeing there were a list of restaurants that delivered. I am pizzar-ed out!

"“Great hotel in great location” We stayed here in May 2011.
We arrived at the hotel at 11am and were able to check into a room even though check-in time isnt usually until 3pm.
Our room was on the 31st floor with great views over to Madisson Square Gardens. The room itself was small but had everything we needed and was fine for a 3 night stay. I think we would have upgraded to a bigger room if we had been staying any longer.
The staff were very helpful and gave us tips on places to go and some leaflets. The Tick Tock Diner which is attached to the hotel is pricey but convenient and we eat there each morning. Go early in order to get quick service. It gets rather busy from 9am onwards as its also open to the public.
The hotel is right next to a subway station and taxis are lined up outside. Macy's is only a block away and its a ten minute walk to times square. You can pretty much walk anywhere once you get the hang of the streets and avenues but when its hot its sometimes easier to get a taxi.
I wouldnt advise late check-out as its $100, leave your bags in the baggage store room for $2 a bag and the hotel also provides a town car to take you back to the airport for a $75 flat fee (JFK)

"“Horrible Customer Service and I will not be back!!!!!!!!!” A group of 9 of young professional ladies checked into this hotel on May 19 for my friends birthday trip. We arrived early and had the hotel hold our bags, they told us to return in 2 hours and that rooms would be ready. We gave them an extra hour, returning in 3 hours and was told that our rooms were not ready and that we would be on all different floors after we had specifically requested being on the same floor next to each other in our reservations months prior. The assistant manager Rowan Beckford was extremely rude, told lies, and left the desk never to return and address the problem again. We waited over an hour in the lobby trying to get this mess sorted out, meanwhile another group from London arrived and were immediately upgraded after their rooms were not ready. Hmmm now whats the problem with this picture??? We finally received the keys to 1 of the 3 rooms and 30 mins later received the keys to the other 2 rooms which we were told were upgraded to larger rooms, but I do not believe this to be the case because they look the same as the rooms on the website. Typical small New York room with a very TINY bathroom without any counter space. The Tick Tock diner was nice enough with pretty good food and large portions. We had an excellent waiter there and I hate that I cant remember his name. The 2nd night of our stay we received a thank you card and a bottle of cheap champaigne to make up for the fiasco at check in but this was a little too late and we know this is only because corporate had to be called because of the rudeness of the staff! The New Yorker will never see a dime of my money again and to think we were there through a military rate bookings. This is definately not a $400 a night hotel.

"“Poor End To A Great Honeymoon!!!” When we walked into the Hotel I was surprised I really liked it till I got to the reception desk, We checked in as usual and was asked to give my card for insidental's so as I have with all the other Hotels that we have stayed in while on our Honeymoon I gave my card only to be told that it has been refused so when I asked why (The car hire was on the card anyway) I was told that $250 will be taken then given back when we checked out this has never happened before in any hotel that I have been to in the USA nor New York, I paided in full for the room before I went and was told that I had to pay the $250 this is not printed anywhere to state this, good job I had the cash!!!

I had a fab time on my honeymoon having been to 3 other hotel's in California but this hotel let me down badly. I work in the travel industry and will not be recommending it to my customers the only good thing about it was the bed!!!! All I can say is that I have stayed in many a hotel in New York and have never been asked to pay or have any money taken off my card for incidentals it is normally as a percaution then when you do come to check out that is when it is paid either from the card details that they hold or something else ie: cash/other card.",deeh74,2011-05-01,122005,2011-06-02,False,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The hotel was great- the room was suprisingly small (but that's typical for New York from what I've heard) but was tastefully decorated and well equiped. It was our first time to New York and provided a great location for us to explore the city by foot. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

"“Nice Hotel, Nice Location” This is a review that I should have submitted at the end of February when we returned from New York. Stayed at the New Yorker with my wife and two children for two nights. This was our second visit to this hotel and we enjoyed our stay. I would have to agree with many of the comments regarding the size of the room, with four of us in our room it was a tight squeeze. Having said that I think that small hotel rooms in New York are to be expected and you don’t travel to New York to sit in your hotel room. The room was tidy and suited our needs. 
We had breakfast each morning in the Tick Tock Diner (entrance from the Lobby) and while quite busy the service was good. The breakfast set us up for the day. While I would have liked to travel out to dinner each evening this was not possible with two small children. Coopers Restaurant is a part of the hotel and we ended up dining there on both evenings. While the food and service is excellent we did dine here last year and I would like to have tried some new restaurants.
The hotel is in a great location, just yards from Penn Station and all major attractions.
Apart from a slight disagreement with the Bell Boy over our luggage just prior to our departure we had a very enjoyable stay and I would have to recommend this hotel.",Munster-FanCork,2011-02-01,122005,2011-05-26,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Amazing Hotel” This hotel was fab. Location is amazing, 2 minute walk from Empire State Building, and Macy's, close enough to walk to Times Square and Theatre District. Bed were so comfy. Rooms very nicley decorated too.",cartercards,2010-10-01,122005,2011-05-26,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great stay but spoilt by constant noise in room” Just returned from my first trip to the New Yorker and was pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. Amazing views from the 33rd floor and the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in before. Location is perfect with everything in walking distance. A nice friendly and relaxed atmosphere at the hotel. Dined several times at the Tick Tock Diner for convenience after very busy days sightseeing and the food and atmosphere both very good.
However my stay was spoilt by a constant humming noise in the room all night long. This really did disturb my sleep as there was no escaping it. As it was only a short stay I tried to make the best of it and purchased some ear plugs to ease the problem, but after my second night decided to mention this problem at reception. The first person I spoke to appeared to know straightaway which room I was staying in as other guests had made the same complaint and suggested the noise was coming from the elevator. I was really unhappy at this because when booking the hotel I specifically requested a room away from the elevator as I had encountered this same problem whilst staying at another hotel.
I was further disappointed when speaking with a Manager who contradicted what I had just been told by the other member of staff by saying they had never had a complaint about any noise from my room. I think someone wasnt being completely honest here. This was confirmed further whilst I was waiting to check out when I overheard a guest who had just arrived complaining of a ""humming sound"" coming from her room and that she thought it was coming from the elevator. I was so tempted to ask her which room she was in!
Despite all that, if I could be guaranteed 100% that I would have a room free from the constant humming sound, I would love to return to the New Yorker in the future.",lucindarose,2011-05-01,122005,2011-05-26,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent honeymoon.” Stayed here in May 2011 for our honeymoon for 6 nights.
Hotel was great and all members of staff made us feel welcome in helping out with any query! It was our 1st visit to New York and as a holiday in NY is mostly sightseeing I would highly recommend this hotel on location alone.It is situated on 34th street on the corner of 8th avenue. Location wise to those that dont know NY like we didnt it is a fab base to have to explore this great city! The plus points are that the empire state building is on 34th street which is a great sight to see from your hotel and is only 5 mins walk away! Also on 34th is Macy's which is great for shopping,not only this but across the road is a 12 screen AMC cinema which is gr8 for a nights entertainment.Food wise the hotel has a Tick tick diner attached to it which was great and huge portions and also all within 1-2 minutes walk you have McDonalds, Wendys, Dunkin donuts, Burger king,Familga Pizza (top!!!) and TGI Fridays. As for general access you also cant go wrong, Penn station and subway station is across the road and you can get any subway line and trains to other city's (Boston, Washington etc) We were there 6 nights and only caught the subway twice as if you dont mind walking you really can walk around to most sights, we walked to times sq (10 mins walk) and Central Park 25 mins walk, ok walking wont be for everyone but we found we took more of the city atmosphere walking through the city (and burned of the calories as we really did eat a lot!!)
Ok as for the rest of the hotel heres the pointers I would want to know before booking:-
Rooms- clean with flatscreen TV (27 channels) daily maid service.Room was quite small but this is normal with NY hotels unless you pay the extra but more than adequate.Another bonus is the hotel has free wifi which as we took the laptop was great for getting the next day planned and checking on google maps how to get there.
Service- All staff members polite (even the mean looking security guys) which being a city hotel you are glad they are there even though I must say I always felt safe in NY. The concierge was a great source of info although dont be lazy and book tickets through them as it pays to shop around! They quoted $169 each for Mama Mia Broadway tickets and we got them from TKTS on Broadway for $89 each and that was for tickets 8 rows from the front (TKTS is a must if you want to catch a Broadway show but you can only buy tickets a few hours before the show thats how they are discounted, normally 50%off!!!)
So all in all highly recommended if your looking for somewhere not too expensive, clean with great facilities and a fab location to sightsee this is the hotel for you!",natalieb1304,2011-05-01,122005,2011-05-25,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Art deco heaven” Just back from a fabulous stay at this hotel. We booked based on 2 recommendations and they were so right! We got an upgrade as it was our wedding anniversary and ended up with a great view of the empire state building :-) great location (we walked everywhere but there are also cabs outside). Great amenities as there is a 24 hr diner next door and a bar on the other side plus gift shop downstairs etc. Room was very clean if small, but all new York rooms are the same and has a maid servic everyday. Great for a busy stay in new York.",kangercol,2011-05-01,122005,2011-05-25,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“We would stay here again” We stayed for 5 nights - our first time in New York. The location was excellent, and perfect for sightseeing. The subway is almost outside the door, plenty of places to eat close by. For a snack the pizza shop opposite was great and the Skylight diner just around the corner on 34th was better value than other places we tried for breakfast. Good shopping less than 5 mins away.
Yes, the room is smallish but how long do you spend in it? The beds are the best thing, really, really comfortable - I want one! The 2nd best thing was being able to check in for our return flight and print our boarding cards for free.
If I want to be picky then I'd say that the bath towells need to be larger and there's only soap provided, no shower gel. Our room had a large walk-in cupboard (not sure if all the rooms do) so we were able to store our suitcases in there too.
We didn't need to use cabs at all, we either walked or used the subway and that includes easy access from JFK. There are not many places in the world where you can say that.",chrispb,2011-05-01,122005,2011-05-25,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Spotlessly clean” I chose this hotel, and before I booked, I found out a relative had also stayed there the previous summer on their honeymoon. Their recommendation confirmed to me I had made the right choice, and booked.
On arrival, there was a bit of a queue to check in, but it passed soon enough. I was given a Metro Room (1 Queen) on the 27th floor. Having read that NYC rooms were known to be small, I was happy when I opened the door to see a decent sized bedroom, and also a bathroom, with a big enough bath.
Small toiletries were left in the bathroom, and were always refilled, and the room was always spotlessly cleaned. I appreciated also the two sets of towels were being left every day, (yes, I reused them), despite being a single traveller. When I pay for the room, I am always disappointed when hotels remove the second set of towels.
The free in room Internet was reliable, and fast, and the modern flat screen TV was also good. If I could make only 1 change, it would be for an in-room mini-safe.",DHMcKenna,2011-05-01,122005,2011-05-24,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Unexpected Luxury!” We visited NYC in the very busy month of August; the streets were packed with tourists, and the temperature was high (25-30 degrees). We had never previously toured the city so we were a bit overwhelmed with the sites/attractions and downtown Manhattan lifestyle. Coming from the city of Toronto we were anticipating walking and not driving to all the hotspots, and definitely wanted to make sure that we reserved a hotel that was not only central to the sites but a place where we could unwind and relax our bodies (especially our feet) after what would surely be long marathon-like days. 
We used the website priceline.com to find a 4 star hotel around $100-$150, and we were booked into the New Yorker Hotel. We didn't know much about the hotel so we didn't really know what to expect.
Once we arrived in New York City (via a 10-hour Megabus ride) we located the New Yorker which was conveniently located on 34th street, and were kindly greeted by the front desk staff. The hotel exterior had an old new york city charm which carried through to the lobby. We had read that the hotel had been recently renovated so the design of the lobby was expected, but what we really wanted to find out was if the room would fair as nicely. Thankfully, in a city known for small rooms and old buildings/hotels, we opened our hotel room door to unexpected luxury. The decor was beautiful; the beds were comfortable and clean, and the washrooms were tidy and an ample size. The maid service was excellent. The hotel provided an internet service, and the front desk was very helpful with restaurant and tourism ideas. 
Perhaps the best part of the Hotel was its location--central Manhattan right next to Madison Square Gardens, and a few blocks from Times Square.
My Advice: Go to Priceline or a similar site, and try to book this hotel! It comes at an affordable price (via these sites) and is central to everything. We were able to stay out late at night and enjoy night tours and sites without having to worry about a long commute back to our hotel. After long days, this is where you want to end up at night to unwind and recharge.",cmanthomas,2010-08-01,122005,2011-05-23,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Find somewhere better” I would not recomend this hotel unless travelling alone as our room was far to small for a couple and our friends were the same. Bath room small also. There was nowhere to put anything .I expect if we paid more it would be a different story.We have all been in many hotels over the years and this was probably the worst for space. The only plus was it is very central.

"“FANTASTIC LOCATION, FANTASTIC HOTEL” We recently stayed in the New Yorker Hotel, W34th St and 8th Avenue. We had a great time, the staff were helpful and courteous. We felt very safe with the security at the entrance to the lift area - you have to show you key card to have access to the lifts to the rooms. The security staff were also very courteous, this hotel is very well run with a big emphasis on customer service. The location was great, 10 minutes from Time Square. Right outside the hotel you can buy the city tour bus tickets - look out for Azim in the yellow hi-vis vest, he gave us a good run through on all our options and had the best value tour tickets (we checked the others before going back and buying his). The tick tock diner next door to the hotel is excellent and the diner called The Stage Door (out of the hotel, turn right cross w34th st and it is on that block) is also brilliant for breakfast. Check out the pancakes, strawberries and maple syrup. This was my first visit to the big apple and I wasn't disappointed - a big thank you to the New Yorker. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would definitely return - we have already recommended the hotel to friends.",Nickandfan,2011-05-01,122005,2011-05-22,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great place to explore” The New Yorker hotel is situated on 34th street just down from Macys and the empire state building, Times sq is about a 10 min walk and Penn st station is on your doorstep.
Underneath the hotel is a 24 hour diner called the Tick Tock, great food good prices and friendly staff (breakfast is great).
Our room was on the 23rd floor, it was actually quite quiet throughout the night, good size bathroom, flat screen tv our beds were made and refreshed everyday the staff are helpfull and if need be there are free safety deposit boxes avaialble to all guests.
check in is from 3pm although if your room is ready they will allow you to check in, check out is by 1100am although you can leave bags until they are needed at a small cost $3 per item, bellboy will always get you a cab when needed, will definatley stay there again.",swedishchefcook,2011-05-01,122005,2011-05-21,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Would stay here again.” Stayed at the New Yorker for 7 nights and had an excellent time. The hotel reserved a bed for our one year old daughter and they also provided a coffeemaker to boil water for her milk. The rooms are not large, but there was enough room for all of us. The bathroom looked somewhat dated, but was by no means dirty. The location is excellent. It´s literally 10 seconds from the subway (ACE) and three minutes from Penn station.

"“Great location, clean rooms but...(please read on)” We got a double room, which is really quite small, but then again I heard most rooms in NY are like this. There is a double bed, and just barely enough space for your luggage if you have big suitcases. But there are many drawers where you can put ur things in, so that solves the space constraint issue. 
If you're staying as a couple I suppose it's fine, but if you're going as friends, I would suggest a room with 2 beds which is slightly more expensive, but gives you at least a bit more personal space.
During my stay, I didn't encounter any noise problems.
There is no refrigerator, which is not a major problem during my stay as it was spring (55-60 degrees F) so I would leave any beverage I like cold by the window sill. Still it would have been nice to have as I would be able to keep my juices and milk cold.
There is also no electric kettle in the room, but we made a call to the front desk and someone sent up a small coffee machine, with packs of coffee and paper cups. One part of the coffee machine was missing so we couldn't make any coffee, which wasn't a problem for us, as we wanted hot water. It was good for boiling one cup of hot water. 
The hotel does not provide room service, but their directory provides a list of some restaurants with a complete menu that might provide 24-h free delivery service. Once the delivery arrives, you will get a call to ur room and the delivery can get sent to your room, so you don't have to leave. There's also a diner located on the first floor of the hotel that is 24h. This can get quite crowded on weekend mornings but if it does, you can always venture out of the hotel to grab breakfast elsewhere.
The location at 8th Ave (34th Street) means that Times Square (42nd Street) is within walking distance if you turn left once you exit the hotel lobby. On this side, there's a beauty supply store across the road where you can get travel sized shampoo if u need. A pharmacy is located just across the road from the hotel if you exit the lobby on the right but this one did not have a doctor on standby. If you need one with a doctor, it is located a few streets away from the hotel if you turn left from the hotel lobby.
You can also find Macy's and many shops nearby. The train station is just round the corner (34th St-Penn Station) and the Port Authority Bus Terminal is within walking distance, if you do not have too much to carry with you (nearer to Hotel than Times Square is).
Overall, I think it's a nice hotel to stay in, if the price of the rooms suit your budget, I would say go ahead. If you're traveling as a family, a suite might be less claustrophobic. As for me, I would probably want to try other hotels with similar rates the next time I visit NYC.",jollybychance,2011-05-01,122005,2011-05-17,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Check in - be warned” Having stayed at the New Yorker 2 years ago and having a problem at check in, I E mailed prior to our arrival to check the booking & confirm our ETA. Booking was confirmed, check in time is from 3pm. All good, we arrived at 3.15 pm, queued only to be told there was no trace of our booking, desite showing them the E mails and the booking confirmaiton from our travel agent, so I had to give all the names in our party, at last success our booking was traced, but only 1 room was ready, ""don't worry, come back at 4pm and it will be ready!, so off we went, returning at 4.15, queued again, couldn't find our booking again, went through it all only to be told that one of the rooms still wasn't ready, and they couoldn't tell me when it could be ready. I was offered 3 options. I could check in 1 room, and wait, change one room to another floor, or change both rooms to another floor, I opted to move both room. So eventuallty we got our keys, we went to our rooms, one room was lovely, but the other room was small, and dark. But after travelling for about 12 hours we decided to get started on our holiday, but this delay really caused us some stress. Talking to other people this problem with check in is not unusual, most people seem to have a problem. It is a shame as this hotel is lovely, it is in a fantastic location, but check in is a nightmare, the staff do not appreciate that most guests have travelled some distance to get there, and why say there is a 3pm check in if rooms are not ready, saying that, when we got to our rooms they were very clean, so maybe that is why it takes so long.",CP123_9,2011-05-01,122005,2011-05-12,False,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Unusual charm and authenticity” This is not a designer boutique experience, it is better, because it is authentic. The New Yorker is old style Art Deco New York, from the concrete exterior that soars in the sky, countering the Empire State just a little further up the street, to the heavy brass fittings and moulded plaster inside. The quaint 24 hour diner, the TicToc is also a time warp. The hotel is also great value; it's unpretentious, as all three stars should be, but it is clean and recently refurbished in a sympathetic style. We needed to work in our room over four days, and on our request for something larger, the manager moved us to a room of significantly grander proportions without asking us to pay more. I told her I'd be sure to report our good experience in Trip Advisor, so voila !

The upgraded rooms views were amazing - Empire State & Hudson River with Statue of Liberty so were very impressed. Room size was sufficient and very bright. The bathroom was small although that wasnt a problem.
We ate in the Tick Tock Diner most days for breakfast. Menu was vast so it was hard to pick something. Food was great and portion sizes were big.
Only downside to hotel was there was no safe in room as there was one in reception area. This was secure so was fine. Only problem was it took the receptionists ages to allow us in to it when we needed it one night when we were in a rush. Most, staff were friendly and helpful, just that one incident spoiled the service for us.

Got a NJ Transit train straight from Newark to Penn Station at 12.50 dollars each. Hotel right beside station. Handy for everything. Subway was brilliant and got us around Manhattan when we could walk no more. Try the Skylight Diner for great value breakfasts and meals. Go out main entrance, go right and right again (dont cross road). Walk up 34th street west and its on the left hand side of street.

"“Good location, reasonable value, but this is an average tourist class hotel pretending to be something rather better.” We booked in advance on-line and got a reasonable price (for NY), perhaps partly because we also paid in full in advance - other hotels were fully booked up in this fairly busy time. Mid-afternoon check in was quick. Our double room was rather rather small, but at least was clean, (looked bigger in the photos!) bathroom OK but shower ran hot and cold unpredictably. We didn't make any use of the hotel sevices so cannot really comment.
This is really an average tourist class hotel masquerading as something a bit more special (due to its history).
We had to move around some furniture to make room for our suitcases, but who goes to NY to stay in their hotel. The bed was comfortable. I know NY is noisy, but the room was noisier than it should have been due to leaky seals on modern sash window fittings, which also made it a bit draughtly. We had a bit of a view from our 30th floor room which was quite nice.
The lifts/elevators were a bit slow coming, but not a real problem. No tea/coffee making facilities in the room, nor a small fridge, which was a dissapointment. The Tic Tok diner on the ground floor was great for filling, reasonably priced breakfasts (we were able to skip lunch most days because of this) and we ate there every morning - triple egg omelette with toast jam and plentiful coffee for about $14 each, but watch for their suggested tips, which are well over the cheeky side of 15%. 
Not sure if it was our imagination, but you seem to get better tables, a bit more food and faster seating if you enter the Tic Tok from the corner street entrance rather than from the hotel lobby.
Weh you try to use the Wi-Fi internet in your room, they try to sell you the premium service for $9.95 a day, but you can avoid this - the standard internet connection was free and quite fast enough for internet browsing and email.
We liked the location, especially as we arrived by Amtrak at Penn Station, which is just over the road. Also near to Times Square, Empire State Building etc and subway stations, although we walked miles in NY and enjoyed it. The main museums and art galleries and Central Park are a bit far away, but reasonably quick by subway. 
Overall we were farily pleased, although we read that there may be better hotels nearby. We would certainly consider staying here again if we wanted to be in that part of NY. Some of the negative reviews seem to be about rooms on the lower floors, so perhaps they are to be avoided.",timalanmoore,2011-04-01,122005,2011-05-08,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Just the Job!!” My friend and I have recently returned from The New Yorker and it was fantastic. We had originally been booked elsewhere, but after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor we asked for another hotel and got this one - thank goodness we did!
The location, room, facilities, everything was excellent. So handy for all the touristy attractions, particularly the Empire State Building and Macey's was just around the corner!! The shopping on 34th street is great and so handy and Times Square is just up the road - we loved it!
Prior to going I cheekily asked for a room with a view and was very pleased to receive an email confirming we wouild have a view of the Empore State and we did!!
A special mention goes to John on the Transportation desk. Although we ended up paying more for a Limo, it was worry free and he managed to get it to pick us up earlier than planned so we were not hanging about in the busy lobby.
The Tick Tock diner attached serves a great breakfast and the Tavern a lovely dinner. However there is a cheaper diner just behind the hotel on 9th Avenue, but the atmosphere in the Tick Tock is great.

"“Well located budget hotel - watch out for overpriced tickets” Had a great few days in New York. Hotel is good enough but far from luxury. Good bits include - well located, tick tock diner, energetic and clean hotel.
Rooms are small, bathrroms poor, hotel looks a bit worn.
Watch out for over priced theatre tickets. Paid $150 each in advance for 2 tickets for Chicago thru continentalguestservices. Collected from the hotel. Queried fact that they had only a face value of $126.50 with no adequate explanation from hotel. Similar tickets were in NY for $76.
Didn't spoil the weekend but left sour taste.
Highlight was Cafe Wha, live music night in greenwich village. Not to be missed if you want a live music night out like the locals do.",alandpamatbish,2011-05-01,122005,2011-05-07,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“GLAD TO BE BACK!” Me and my sister have just returned to the New Yorker for a 5 day stay,we got the same room as last year which was massive,2 large queen beds overlooking the hudson river,large flat screen in the room,i emailed before we travelled and asked if there was any chance of an upgrade,emailed straight back and said we could have same room! We like this hotel due to its location,5 minute walk from Penn station,10 minute walk to bus station (we used the train to get from Newark $12.50,and the newark airport bus to get back $15.00),both of these were easy use and so much cheaper,cost us $85 in a taxi last year! The location is great,5 minutes to Macys,10 minutes to Times Square,10 minutes to 5th Avenue,Maddison Square gardens is across the road,across the road is Mc donalds,burger king,wendys and plenty of cheap places were the locals eat,we used these,great food and very cheap. The hotel has great security,need to show pass before using the lifts, a $300 deposit is required when checking in either by card or in dollars,when checking out can leave your bags in storage for a dollar a bag until time to leave for your flight home.

"“Does the job.” Overall this hotel does the job. It's clean, conveniently located adjacent to Penn Station and therefore a multitude of options on the subway, and has free WiFi.
The bathroom water situation is a little bit sketch as the building is older. My showerhead spewed water in an odd mist and toilet flushes on my floor led to sudden bouts of glacier water. The bathroom was otherwise clean and well-stocked. I can't complain, even if I did pay $250/night - after all, it was nearing peak season (May) and the 4-star lineup in the city was asking at least $350/night.
The concierge I dealt with here was not very helpful - to be fair, he has no Internet access at his station. That being said, I asked for a cab to carry a bike and he asked me if I had a smartphone. They need to hire a professional concierge with hotelier experience.",ortho_fx,2011-05-01,122005,2011-05-06,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent” We stayed at the New Yorker from 18-25 April. The front desk staff were easily charmed, quick and efficient in dealing with queries and our booking. I had read some bad reviews about them before arriving but found these untrue. Excellent with safety deposit boxes however these are in a room off the lobby not in your room. The hotel also offers a place to keep your bags until you check in/out at a reasonable $1 per bag. 
We had 2 rooms, one was quite a lot smaller than the other but we were there to sight see and shop. I don't believe it should be compared to beach holiday resorts. It was literally a place to sleep, shower and leave our belongings.
All in all, the hotel added to the New York experience and I would recommend it to anyone.",TooTrueAdvice,2011-04-01,122005,2011-05-06,True,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Can Wait to Return in 2012” We stayed in the New Yorker for 5 nights in September 2010. Check in was a breeze with the staff being very helpful. We arrived early but our room was ready for us. It was more than adequate with a really comfortable bed and a great shower, that's all you need as there's too much to see in New York that you would want to stay in your room.
Before leaving the UK we had purchased the New York City pass that included 3 day bus pass and entrance into all the main attractions - it was a great way to get around.
We took in all the sites - ESB, Rockerfeller Centre, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, Ground Zero, Central Park and Madame Taussauds. The walk over the Brooklyn Bridge was one of the highlights for us as we had seen it so many times on TV. 
We were lucky enough to be in NYC for the King Tuts exhibition that was really interesting.
The pass also included reduced rates to Woodbury Common which is a shoppers paradise just 1hr outside the city. We caught the 8.30 bus and spent the whole day there, well worth a visit.
There are so many places to eat, we had breakfast 1 morning in Tick Tock, it was nice but there are too many restaurants to choose from to eat in the same place every day.
Macys was amazing and as we were there over labour day weekend there were plenty of bargains, there's a visitors card you get which gives a further 10% off everything you buy. 
All in all we had a fantastic time and the New Yorker was everything we had hoped for. It's in a central location opposite Madison Square Gardens, a block from Macy's and a short walk to the ESB. It's spotlessly clean with very friendly, helpful staff.

"“excellent hotel with helpful staff!” My daughter&I stayed in this hotel 27thApril-1st May 2011 and before our visit I contacted them to say I was celebrating a special birthday.I had a swift reply to say we had an upgrade to a higher floor with views of Empire State building.On arrival we were checked in by Jimmy who was most helpful&friendly.We went to our room on 37th floor and were very impressed with the layout and furnishings.Yes the bathroom is on the small size,but it was perfectly adequate for what we wanted.On opening the drapes we had the best view of the Empire State building,I could have sat there and just looked at it!The beds are soooooo comfortable,ideal when you have been sightseeing and just want to rest up.We could not find fault at all with the room or the hotel,it was spotlessly clean.Our room was cleaned and towels replaced each day,the room staff very attentive.Having read some of the previous reviews it makes me wonder if some people just like to whinge and complain for the sake of it!I will certainly return to the New Yorker and will tell all my friends that this is the only hotel to stay in.

“Excellent Hotel” After reading some of the reviews on trip advisor before we got to New York I didnt expect the service we received. The hotel receptionist couldnt have been nicer.

"“A Great Hotel...In A Great Location.” This was our first visit to New York, and we could not have picked a better hotel to stay in.
The New Yorker was dead easy to get to from the airport, forget the taxi, we took the airtrain from JFK to Jamaica station ($5 each) then the Long Island Rail Road to Penn station ($6.25 each) which is across the street from the hotel. I don't think you could get any closer (for less $$) if you tried. The lobby was fairly busy when we arrived and took about 5-10 minutes to get checked in. We had a nice room on the 28th floor with a decent view of the city, although did not face the Empire State Building. The room was clean, the bed was comfy and there was enough space for us, although I have been in larger rooms. No tea/coffee maker in the room. The bathroom was clean and well stocked, but felt a bit dated, compared to the rest of the room. Seeing that the hotel had just undergone a refurb, we felt the bathroom had been left out. The tiling needed some improvement.
We heard minimal street noise, and the AC was fairly quiet too. 3 good nights of sleep were had. The Tick Tock diner is attached to the hotel, and is open 24 hours. It can get quite busy, but we did not have to wait. The food is good and resonably priced. There is a small shop in the lower lobby, with the business/fitness centre which sold very resonably prices gifts and souvenirs. Coopers Tavern is also attached to the hotel, which is a pub/bar restaurant, with a Happy Hour.
When we return to New York we would have no quarms about staying here again. The hotel is 1 block from Madison Square Gardens, 3 blocks from The Empire State Building, with in easy walking distance to Times Square, Macys and the subway is just outside the hotel. There is also a McDonalds across the street and a Wendys & Burger King around the corner.
You can't get better than that.",ManHeadingNorth,2011-04-01,122005,2011-05-01,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Lovely hotel in a great spot in Manhattan with fab staff.” My boyfriend and I stayed here for 6 days. The room we had was lovely, keep very clean by house keeping with an excellent ciew down to rhe Hudson River. The staff went out of their way to help with any queries we had. We met Mark the hotel manager who is brilliant and couldn't do enough to help make our stay perfect. The location is great for the shops and very close to Macy's which had their sales on so bargains galore! There are loads of diners, cafes, fast food places and restaurants surrounding the hotel. There's also a cinema opposite too. I wasn't that keen on their diner Tick Tock. I requested a table for breakfast for 2 & i was told I couldn't be seated by myself until my boyfriend arrived (he was in the hotel room) after much a to do i was allowed to sit at the table for 2, I ordered a latte.. It mever came.. So I asked my waiter if I could call my room to hurry my boyfriend along only to be told I wasn't allowed to leave my table?! I felt like I was back at school! We chose The New Yorker because of the good reviews it had on Trip Advisor. I would recommend people stay here.",Twiggy_loves_NYC,2011-04-01,122005,2011-05-01,True,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Fabulous Location” We holidayed at the New Yorker as we were celebrating my daughter's 30th birthday. We had a shaky start as the limousine transfer arranged via the New Yorker was not very successful. The driver went to the wrong terminal and when he did eventually locate us and take us to the car park (some two hours after arrival) he could not find his car - my daughter's friend was apopleptic when he stood in the middle of a very large car park holding the key fob to the heavens in the hope of finding it! We were not impressed that the driver blamed the hotel and the hotel blamed the airline for landing in terminal B rather than the usual terminal C, even though we gave them our flight details - haven't they heard of the internet??? What if we had been delayed - the driver may have had a very long wait.....
However, once we got over the upset of the delayed arrival in New York and reached our rooms on the 32nd floor, we were very pleased. My friend and I had a room on the corner from which we could see the Empire State Building from one window and the Hudson river from the other. There were two queen beds and an adequate bathroom with the deepest bath and the most powerful shower, plus lashings of hot water. The lack of tea making facilities did not worry us, my trusty kettle has travelled the world. It would, however, have been nice to have a mini bar or room service facility, but it was not the end of the world. 
On the first morning after arrival we made our way to Battery Park for our visit to the Statue of Liberty. It was definitely worth organising this before we got there, the queue for those who went on spec was between three and five hours! That evening we had dinner on the World Yacht, which was a truly wonderful experience, we were thorougly spoiled by the excellent staff. On our second day we ""did"" Central Park in the rain, which meant it was almost empty, but did not detract from our enjoyment. After lunch the weather improved and we took a horse and carriage ride, much enjoyed by all and then visited Tiffany's and Bloomingdales, to drool over the many things we could not afford. Followed by a trip up the Top of the Rock, which despite the not so good weather afforded better views than we had expected. The following morning dawned bright and sunny so we went to the ESB, having taken the advice of the excellent staff at the New Yorker to purchase an express ticket as we were short for time. This saved us about three hours queuing and not only was the trip up express, but so was the trip down! We followed this with an open top bus trip on the Greyline HOHO bus, managing to fit in two routes and getting a bit sunburnt in the process. On our last day we visited Macy's and several other stores to purchase our souvenirs, before using the hotel shuttle bus to return to the airport, which was very efficient and a great improvement on the service at the beginning of our stay. 
All in all we had a fabulous time in New York and woud stay at the New Yorker again in a heartbeat. The staff were all most helpful and the food at the Tick Tock Diner and Coopers Tavern was very good and reasonably priced. I can highly recommend the Linguine Putenesca with shrimp, although the portions are huge - be warned!
We were not lucky enough to be allocated a Big Apple Greeter, but as it was Easter Weekend, that is hardly surprising. This is a great idea and we will try again when we next visit New York to see all the things we didn't have time for. Thanks also to all on the forum for their assistance and advice, which as invaluable.",anlaby1976,2011-04-01,122005,2011-05-01,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Stay!” Very convenient for ESB, Times Square, Macy's and subway. Large hotel but good standard of housekeeping, comfortable bed, nicely decorated but no fridge or kettle/coffee maker in the room. We booked a double room and a twin for the 'kids' (in their twenties), their room was about 3 times bigger than ours!We took the city bus trip (48hours, hop on/off) which was great for seeing the sights and getting your bearings. Would recommend 'Top of the Rock' at the Rockefeller Centre great views and not as crowded as the Empire State Building. Anything that needs a ticket, book before you go to avoid the queues. Tickets to go up to the crown of the Statue of Liberty are booked up until August, For clothes shopping try Century 21 down near Ground Zero, you have to rummage but some good buys!",JanNewMalden,2011-04-01,122005,2011-04-29,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location, Friendly Staff” We stayed at the New Yorker April 13 - 17 2011 and we really had an excellent time. The location is perfect for viewing all the sights and for shoppers a 3-4 minute walk to Macy's (bring your passport for the 10% discount and if Canadian you can open an account and maybe get a further discount on everything you buy for 48 hours. They had this promo and i got another 20% making it 30%).
The hotel staff were very friendly and I requested a small fridge and got it within the hour. We got a buffet breakfast included on the 39th floor with great views of the city. The diner attached is very reasonable and the food and portions are excellent. The rooms were very clean and as with New York small but very comfortable.
If you want to see the city get a ticket outside on the corner with the guys in the yellow jackets,for $55 you havea two day pass hop on/hop off and includes a boat ride on the Hudson. I also used the subway and that is excellent, make sure you have change if there are no ticket agent as we had difficulty with a $20 note with the machine.Lots of great bars cose by try Molly Wee's and Tir na nOg between 33rd and 34th.

 My husband was due to come on the 6 day trip with my Daughter & her friend but was taken ill so unable to travel . I emailed the hotel as soon as I found out 5 days before, asking for two rooms together. This was confirmed by them, as done . Upon checking in not only were they not next to each other, they were on different flloors !!! I asked to see a Manager as this was unacceptable. After an hour I finally got two rooms on the same floor. When checking my room was smaller than booked . I went down again to Duty Manager try to change, would or could not change !!! These two people were the worse FOH staff I have encounted on my 5 previous visits to NYC. This was brought to the attention of the General Manager a day later & since has offered something for my next visit, nice but would have better to have been dealt with on this stay ..

"“Wonderful Hotel and location” The New Yorker Hotel was amazing. My family and I stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed every single one of them. On arrival we were greeted cheerily by Ray and our rooms upgraded as I was celebrating my 40th Birthday and my parents their Wedding Anniversary. The rooms were on 27th floor and both overlooked the Empire State Building. They were comfortable and clean and despite previous reports I didn't find mine small at all. The bathroom was compact but functional and always cleaned to a high standard daily and towles replaced. The beds were so comfortable - we all slept soundly.
The location of this hotel is perfect - we walked to Times Square every night - just a few blocks away and Macys just a very short distance.
We ate in the Tick Tock Diner which was also very good - the portions ENORMOUS - if you're British like us then I would suggest if you have the pasta of the day then this can be shared with another person as I would describe it as being served in a mixing bowl! It was delicious even if I couldn't eat it all.

Four Star Stage Door diner on 8th & 33rd preferable to the Tick Tock Diner (which is part of the hotel.) Coopers Tavern has a reasonable pre theatre fixed price menu $19.95.

"“Fantastic, Clean, Safe and Excellent Value For Money” 7 day family vacation at the New Yorker Hotel in NYC. Brilliant family friendly hotel. Rooms were immaculate, spotlessly clean and modern. Beds were so comfortable, aircon was a great luxury, lcd tv, we had a room on the 34 floor and had very little street noise considering we were on the crossroads with Penn Station/Madison Square Garden. Staff were very friendly and helpful security staff checking room keys before allowing guests into the elevators which was a nice touch. Ate at the adjoining Tik Tok Diner, size of servings was huge, go for the omlette and potatoes and you won't need anything else all day! Fantastic location able to walk to all major locations. We had a city room view of the Empire State Building well worth the extra upgrade. Free internet and dozens of free view channels. The hotel is one of the oldest and most established in NYC its style is art deco and had a refurb a couple of years ago. Spoke with other hotel guests when we were there and they could not fault it! Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",countymonaghan,2011-04-01,122005,2011-04-21,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good location, convenient and clean” My wife & I stayed stayed on a 3 night break in New York at the end of March for her 50th birthday. The hotel was very busy constantly. (as was New York !!)However, we found it to be clean and in a great location for everything. Very near Macey's, Empire State building, Times Sq. Opposite Madison Sq Garden.
The concierge was a massive help with recommendations and tickets.
Avoid Coopers Tavern immediately next door. Very expensive drinks ranging from 10 dollars one night for a beer and a wine to 25 dollars the next night for the same order plus a coke.
We upgraded to a suite for around $20 a night which was good value. Beds were fabulously comfortable.Get your coffee from Starbucks opposite & not in the Hotel foyer. Andrew'sDiner nearby was great for breakfast.",phlipManchester,2011-03-01,122005,2011-04-20,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Awesome Hotel for the Location&Price!” This hotel deserves a five star rating because this hotel met and exceeded every expectation. The suite we had was great and very spacious with 2 closets, a separate living area and bedroom. Our room really felt like a high end apartment that would go for a million, but only cost us under $400 a night which is a price you really can't beat. The room we had even had a balcony and the views from the windows within the room were amazing. It had a clear view of the Empire State Building and skyline which was pretty unbelievable. Location wise the hotel was great because it was within footsteps of Penn Station, the BoltBus stop was located right on the side of the hotel, and there were plenty of subway stations close by. All in all I would definitely would recommend this hotel when visiting New York because it really is a nice place to stay at with great rates and service. I know that the next time we visit New York we will definitely being staying at the New Yorker again.",kirkbngr,2011-04-01,122005,2011-04-20,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“OK Hotel at OK Price.” The hotel is huge and old. The rooms are small but ok to NY Standards. The location is good though and easy access to subways and shops. Staff is friendly at check-in. This is a huge hotel so you don't get the same kind of attention as a smaller boutique hotel but it is also cheaper. I would only recommend this hotel if you get a good deal and are not expecting a beautiful 4 star hotel. If you pay high rates for there is much better in New York. Overall nice old hotel worth checking out if you are not looking for anything too expensive.,theoeb,2010-05-01,122005,2011-04-20,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Great service, perfect location, nice atmosphere, delicious food!! Its a fantastic base to start exploring the city. walking distance to Times Square (10min max). The Empire Stare is just a Block away. Madison Square Garden across the Road. A subway Station right outside. We had a fantastic vacation. We did loads in the 6 days we had. I would love to return to NYC again, its a great city. If I do I'll definately staying in the New Yorker Hotel!!

"“Fantastic Hotel” We have just recently got back from a 6 night stay in New York, we had a fantastic time I cant belieive how much we done. We arrived late afternoon to the New Yorker no waiting at the reception got seen straight away by Mohammed, who when reliased we were staying for 6 nights went and spoke to his manager who gave us a free upgrade to a lovely room on the 20th floor, there was 3 us staying in 1 room myself, husband, and 15 year old son, and the room he gave us had plenty of room 2 bathrooms and 2 large closets which was not only big enough to store our clothes but also the suitcases. the room was cleaned every day also the sheets and towels were changed daily even when I told the cleaner not to worry about the rooom for 1 day (we woke up a bit later one morning - jet lag) after coming back from a trip out the room had been cleaned and bedding and towels changed. The hotel also boasts a great gym for those who want to keep fit which is free to Hotel guests, and if you need to print boarding cards this is also complementary. The staff are friendly and helpful.
Tick Tock Diner we had breakfast there once great food and service but if going there for breakfast go early or you will end up queueing for a table, when this happened to us we went round the side of the Hotel and ate at the Skylight Diner and found the food and service as good as TickTock although busy there was no queue and it was a bit cheaper.
The only fault I could find with the Hotel the main doors were very heavy to open, they did open the revolving doors a couple of mornings which helped then they put staff on the main doors to open for the guests.",FATBUTFIT,2011-04-01,122005,2011-04-18,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Great Place To Stay Close To It All.........” Stayed at the New Yorker 3rd-10th March 2011. Got to the hotel about 1.30pm and checked in no problems. Got a free upgrade as it was for my 40th Birthday so was on the 37 floor with a great view of the Empire State Building witch was the iceing on the cake. The room as people say was small but very nice you don't come to New York City to stop in. The room very nice clean tidy bathroom good size. Tick Tock dinner downstairs was very nice clean and tidy around $10-$13 for most meals. TIP found a great Bistro on 34th street by the Cinema which you helped yourshelf to and pay by weight which saved alot about $6-£10 for a good meal with fruit and drinks. If stopping 5 days or more get a Metrocard Unlimited $13 which can be used on Buses and Metro 24hrs a day. The only thing with the Metro wish would put at the top of the Stairs this train goes Uptown or Downtown would save alot of time. But trains clean and safe. Yellow cab from JFK around $55. If going shopping take your passport to Macy's Visitor centre get 10% off and if you go when a sale is on you save big time. Shop around some great bargains. If into Photographer B & H store on 34th street save on all items there.

Very serviceminded staff, from the first email I sent to confirm the booking and ask for a fridge to the man helping us with the transport to the airport. 
Only downside was the shower.. goes from hot hot to icecold and can make you scream your lungs out. The bathroom could use a little make over too, but it was okay. 
Tik Tok diner was okay, staff could use a course in smiling though.
Would like to recommend getting a limo to pick you up at the airport. (order it at the hotel website.) The limo ride into the city from Newark with a fun, entertaining driver and the New York skyline..

"“Excellent price, location, service, cleanliness ... what more could you want ?” I stayed in the New Yorker hotel after it was recommended by a number of people in Vietnam and by friends at home. This was my first time in New York so i wanted a good location hotel and i got just that. 2 min walk from time square , in particular rooms you can see the empire state. I stayed in a queen sized room with a city view and i could see over the hudson river.
I saw previous reviews that the rooms are small, The queen sized room i had was perfect how much room do you need in a room you stay in for a week or so ... the linen was clean along with the bathroom, comfy bed , the room was made up every day.
I tried the two local resteraunts ""tik tok diner"" and ""coopers tavern"" both i can say are good places to eat. coopers tavern to beautiful evening meals while the tik tok diner i felt was more of a breakfast place, I would recommend trying the waffles when in tik tok diner !
Checking in and out was no hassle , i had no problems what so ever with the hotel everything was spot on, They organised a car for my return back to JFK with a local guy who was a good laugh this also worked out cheaper than getting a taxi !!

The staff is friendly. The room was very small and the beds were good. Overall it is clean, which I consider important.
Enough elevators that go very fast, waiting time is short. Our room was on a higher floor, so no noise from outside. 
We did not take breakfast in the hotel, I am not sure if they offer it.

"“Would stay again!” Stayed at The New Yorker first week of March 2011 for 7 nights. Arrived on airtrain from Newark Airport straight into Penn station which is located just across the road from the hotel, perfect! Check in was quick and easy even though it was peak time for check in. But please be aware that you must make a $300 payment for deposit when you check in! This was not explained to us by our travel agent (Thomson) but we were aware of this through reading reviews on Tripadvisor, i just dont think it's mentioned enough on here. I also recommend the safety deposit boxes in reception I was unsure at first but security is very good. Our room was situated on the 22nd floor, we had a double/double with plenty of room, a nice sized bathroom with good shower, good closet space and plenty of drawers. But most importantly the room was spotless! Beds were really comfortable too. New york is a very noisy city, but we had no trouble whatsoever with traffic noise from the 22nd floor. And the view of The Empire State Building was an added bonus. The location of this hotel is excellent! Walking distance to Times Square or if you are going further afield its just a case of jumping on the subway at Penn Station, but personally I recommend walking, you see so much more. We had no issues with the area at all even at night, we even hit a couple bars in the area and although we are 2 girls we felt safe enough. We liked The Tick Tock Diner (attatched to hotel), TGI Fridays and Tir 'na 'nog Irish bar. These are just a stones throw from the hotel. There is also a 24hr pharmacy (Duane Reade) across the road, which is very handy for some snacks and water for the room. There was a vending machine on our floor but we found it cheaper to buy our own. I cannot fault our stay whatsoever, a hotel can sometimes make or break a trip and The New Yorker certainly had a big say in making our trip to New York absolutely fantastic! The staff were friendly and very helpful at all times. There is a hidden gem in this hotel too, the gift shop!!! We found so many gifts in this shop alot cheaper than gift shops around the city and it's alot less busy too! So dont waste time shopping in the big gift shops, we bought most of ours on the day we departed with what cash we had left over from the trip, so its ideal. So overall a very very good trip to the big apple, I loved every minute of it.

"“Excellent hotel” We are currently staying at The New Yorker and will be leaving in 2 days. The hotel is brilliant value for money. We got a free upgrade and were given a corner room on the 36th floor with amazing views of the Empire State Building. The room is clean, and very comfortable. Yes, the bathroom is small but it's spotless and has everything you need-toiletries, hair drier, fresh towels etc. Check in was a breeze and FRIENDLY staff! 
Tick Tock Diner is good for food-not cheap and the tips are a must (but fair enough-people need to make a living!), but massive portions and tasty. 
Location is a dream-opposite subway, 10 mins from Times Square and Empire State Building. Opposite a cinema (which we have used to rest our tired feet!), places to eat, and generally we felt very safe.

"“Good mid-range hotel, perfect Midtown location, terrific value” We booked on the basis of Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed. The location next to Penn Station, on the A, C and E subway lines is perfect for getting around Manhattan. Macy's is a block away and Times Square is walkable in 10-15 minutes. The rooms are recently renovated and quite spacious. The bathroom didn't have much space for putting things down, the shower temperature never stayed still (although there was always hot water) and the towels were very small! All was very clean though. No coffee maker or fridge in the room, but there was a drugstore across the street and a breakfast coffee kiosk in the lobby.

“Loved the New Yorker” As others have said The New Yorker is in a great location. We arrived quite early but they allowed us to check in since there was a room available.

Bed was comfy and since we were at the end of the hallway didn't hear much noise. We were on the 34th floor and had a great view! Had very good breakfast at the Tick Tock Diner.

The lobby is grand and bustling, with a large seating area and an opulent art deco chandelier. The front desk staff were wonderful and gave us a corner room on a high floor with two windows: one facing the Empire State building & Chrysler building and the other facing the river. We kept our curtains open all night just to marvel at the gorgeous nighttime view! The room was small but extremely comfortable - it looked like it was recently renovated - great bed, pillows & linens, art-deco style desk & furniture, large flat-screen TV. There was a closet with ironing board. Very nice toiletries in the bathroom, full tub with shower, hairdryer. We really liked the way they renovated the room to keep the architectural details of the hotel. No coffee/tea maker in the room, but in the lobby they have a stand where you can buy coffee/tea and breakfast items in the morning. We sat down and ate breakfast in the adjoining Tick Tock Diner - a bagel with cream cheese and a huge amount of smoked salmon; delicious and a good value.

"“Great Find!” Recently had a lovely stay at The New Yorker. I chose this hotel last minute when coming in to the city to see a concert at Madison Square Garden. It is literally one block away from the back/8th avenue entrance to MSG/Penn station. Talk about convienent! I was a little hesitant as the price through hotels.com was much cheaper than any pace Ive stayed in the city & the closeness to Penn station. I was pleasantly suprised how wrong I was! The hotel was very nice. Check in was a breeze, the lady who checked us in was very nice, sorry I cant remember her name but she was very helpful & friendly. The room I had was 3312. It had a great view of the Empire State Building right outside the window & I did NOT pay for a empire view room. The other window looked out on to MSG. The room was very clean & comfortable. Some might say it was a bit small but by NYC standards there was plenty of room. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was small but immaculate & bright. The hotel has a diner attached called the Tick Tock. We had a great dinner there, classic diner fare but big portions and tasty. Breakfast was also good, the diner is always packed with people which is a good sign.

"“Central to lots of attractions, clean and typical NYC size” Stopped here recently with my husband for a short break. Lovely hotel, lots of history - excellent view of ESB from our room (we paid extra but was worth it). You have to show your room card when accessing elevators to rooms but I was glad of the extra security. No safe in your room but you can have a safe deposit box for free and they double-check it's you who's accessing it so, again, I was glad of the extra security. Temp on the shower, as other reviewers have said, was unpredictable but this is an older hotel so you have to expect that I suppose. Bathroom small - typical NYC size though !! The diner attached to the hotel, Tick Tock diner, was very good for breakfast but hit and miss the rest of the day. Finally, on your day of departure, your luggage can be left in a secure room off the lobby for $1.50 per case. Macy's is only a short walk away, as is the ESB and Times Square - some lovely Irish bars nearby too.

"“Great hotel, clean room, and central location for a reasonable rate.” My daughter and I were in NYC for 5 days touring colleges and dorms for the fall. We chose to stay at the New Yorker as one of the dorms we were touring was in their building. We arrived and found that the front desk folks were very friendly and even upgraded us to a room with two double beds and two bathrooms. A huge score for a dad traveling with a teenage daughter. The room was very clean and had very comfortable beds. 
I had read in other reviews of people complaining about the unfriendly staff, I hope they remember that this is New York not Disneyland. I found that everyone we encountered was very nice and cordial, we were always greeted by hello's and good mornings as we would pass staff in the halls.
I spent time each day in the excersise room and everything in there was brand new lifecycle equipment. So if you read it was crowded and old, that must be a very old review.
Overall it is a great hotel with a great location to Time Square, 
Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and the original Macy's on 34th and 6th.

"“Beware of the $300 security deposit not mentioned when booking.” My husband and I stayed here from 3rd to 7th March and found it to be over-all quite good apart from the shock of being asked for a $300 (returnable) security deposit, as it's not mentioned on their website nor on the website through which the holiday was booked- 'Travelcube'. What didn't help was the attitude of the guy on the front desk which was unsympathetic and aloof to say the least. All he could say was our travel agent should have told us, but that's not possible if it's not on their website in the first place! While we enjoyed our stay in general, a couple of the guys on the desk could do with a few lessons in manners and how to make their guests feel welcome and appreciated, because they certainly didn't make us feel THAT. . .We hope to return to New York sometime soon, it's a fantastic city, and we would stay here again, but here's hoping they have a better attitude towards their guests next time, everyone deserves a second chance, I guess . . .",INTROVERT/EXTROVERT,2011-03-01,122005,2011-03-30,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great stay” Stayed at the New Yorker for a week in March 2011. It was an exceptional stay. Housekeeping was immaculate and friendly. I would definitely stay there again.

Free WiFi in the rooms, hi speed(paid) and slower service(free). Free service fine for checking mails and news websites. Location next to MSG, Penn Station and only a short walk to Port Authority/Time Sq/Macys was perfect. House keeping staff, security and porter all excellent.

"“Great Hotel, Great location” We chose this hotel for its proximity to Madison Square Gardens as we were going to a gig there. Its literally across the road as is the Cinema (ideal for resting those tired feet late at night) and the always fantastic Five Guys burger joint :)
Check in was smooth but as we were early there was only one of the two rooms available for us. We dumped our bags into the one room and set off exploring. When we returned and got the 2nd room there was a clear difference in room quality. Ours was a corner room and was very light and airy whereas the first room was a side room and was very dark in comparison. If you are prepared to wait, I'd recommend asking for a corner room. Both rooms are on the small side but I think thats just New York tbh.
Attached to the hotel is the Tick Tock Diner which was very good for breakfast but not so for Dinner.
The hotel is on 34th and is just down the road from Macy's and the Empire State Building. Penn Street station is right across the road and Times Square is a short walk.
On check out you can leave your bags at the hotel for a $1 each bag.
Would definitely book again and would have no hesitation recommending this hotel.",P0tt3r,2011-02-01,122005,2011-03-29,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Location and service were extraordinary!” A friend and I brought our 18 year old daughters to NYC for an early graduation trip and we were all very pleased with our stay at the New Yorker Hotel. We chose this hotel partly because they offer a military discount. Since we came in at Penn Station the location was perfect....we were thrilled to be able to see the hotel right when we left the train station, drop our bags and start exploring the city.

The Penn Station location can't be beat, not least because you have direct access to the trains to EWR and JFK that are both fast and cheap.

Checkin was a bit mental-very busy and staff weren't very friendly! Plus had to give $300 deposit as room safetly but got it back on checkout-but would have been nice to know about this in advance. Otherwise, room was lovely and clean; very comfortable bed; and had great view of the Empire State Building.

The hairdryer in our room did not work, but after a call down to the front desk, they replaced it with a working one within 20 minutes.

"“Great location!” My husband and I visited NY for a week. The hotel was good - and yes, the rooms were small - but honestly, how long to you spend in your room? I agree with the other reviewer - the plumbing is VERY noisy!! If someone in an adjacent room flushes the toilet in the middle of the night, you WILL be woken from your sleep! The room was comfy and the bed and bed linen very good quality (something I will NOT compromise on!). Lovely little packs in the bathroom with 2 x soaps, 1 x moisturiser, 1 x shower cap, 1 x shampoo and 1 x conditioner and these are replenished daily so there's no need to take your own products. The chambermaids were lovely - especially Rosa who was very friendly and accomodating. The hotel is perfectly located for all the local attractions - Penn Street Station across the road - Macy's round the corner - Time Square ten minutes away. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms - but there are Dunkin' Donuts, Starbucks and a 7 Eleven thirty seconds from the hotel. A good tip - if you need any information - DON'T GO TO THE INFORMATION DESK!! The staff who manned this desk on EVERY occasion we had to ask something - had absolutely no clue - and we were ALWAYS referred to the reception desk - Grrr!! So we soon learned our lesson! LOL! We had breakfast a couple of mornings at the Tick Tock Diner which is attached to the hotel and can be accessed from the lobby - beware - HUGE delicious portions!! If you have a late breakfast there, you won't need any lunch! In all we had a blast in New York!

"“Great location, very clean, comfy beds - overall a great experience!” We booked this hotel at the recommendation of a friend. We arrived at Penn station by train which was very conveniently located directly across the street. Before arriving, I emailed the concierge telling them that this was our first trip to NYC and that we were travelling with our children (6 and 7 years). They emailed me back the following day saying they'd upgraded us to a 35th floor room with a view of the Empire State building. When we checked in, we weren't disappointed. The staff was very polite and helpful. The room was small as expected in Manhattan but very clean. The bathroom could use a little facelift, but it had character and overall our living quarters were very quaint. Again, everything was very clean, which is paramount!! The view was splendid and every night, the Empire State Building was lit up with different colour lights (green on St. Paddy's Day!) Our room was located in a little alcove with only 3 other rooms which made it very quiet - perfect for tired children (and parents too).
We walked everywhere and on days where we had to cover more territory, we took the train which was conveniently located across the street. The concierge was very helpful when we asked her about area restaurants and local attractions. 
Since it was our first time in NYC, we saw as much as we could but we are already planning another trip there to take in some of what we missed. We will definitely stay at the New Yorker again - we were very pleased!",Canadian_girl20310,2011-03-01,122005,2011-03-21,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great value and location” I don't think you could get a better hotel in New York for the money. It's an old building, the rooms and bathrooms aren't big, and the plumbing is VERY noisy. But the location is great (easy to get to and from JFK via Penn Station over the road), you can walk to all the Midtown tourism sites, and a cab from the Times Square area is only about $5 when you want to get back quickly at night. Very safe, comfortable and clean, staff were all helpful, courteous and efficient (I rang down one night when some kids were making a lot of noise, security were on it within minutes). Both the Tick Tock diner and hotel bar are great for food and drinks and just downstairs - though you're not short of places to eat round here. After checking out on the last day you can store your bags for just $1 each. There's an amazing cinema round the corner if you want to go out but your feet have given up on you.

"“The worst room in NYC” Came to New York this past weekend with my daughter for conference, as well as some shopping in the mix.
THE BAD: 
Ok, so here's the story. We got there early in the morning and no rooms were available. We were allowed to check our bags, and see the city before checking in later that afternoon. Upon check-in, the guy at the front desk told us that he had given us a ""great"" room. What a complete lie! First off, the room was incredibly small (#2341). Not a big deal as it is expected in New York City. However, there was no shower head on the shower, and water sprayed everywhere all over the bathroom. When one tried to shut off the water it would continue to drip. Our room was located right beside the electrical room and across from one of the housekeeping storage areas. Therefore sleeping, was not a feasible possibility. We called down to the front to ask for a room change but they assured us that the noise would quiet down and there would be no problem. ANOTHER LIE! Not only were doors slamming all evening long but the noise from the staff yelling and talking to each other was also loud and annoying. Our room was also apparently right beside the external piping of the building as every 15-20min we would hear water rushing through the pipes (right by our heads). Both my daughter and I could not sleep the entire night. Having to be at a conference early the next morning we were exhausted and frustrated, which ruined a good portion of our day that day. I have absolutely no idea how anyone could sleep in that room, or how the hotel staff could even consider placing paying guests there. (Also forgot to mention the periodic scratching noises we heard throughout the night...mice anyone?)
THE GOOD: So after enduring our night from hell, we finally called the front desk again and asked to speak to the manager. The woman we spoke to (Erica) was great. After listening to all our complaints she set us up with a Deluxe room (apparently only 2 of these on a floor) that was NO COMPARISON to our first. This one was located in a corner on the floor. Lots of space, large windows, and quiet with a great view of the Empire State Building as well. Just wish we didn't have to go through hell to get it. 
Other good points: staff were great, and the location is very good being right across from Penn Station and walking distance to lots of great shopping and sights. 
There are too many other great hotels in the city that I can't say I'd ever come back here, even though they made up for the horrible first night we had. Either make sure you book a deluxe room, or save yourself the worry and book elsewhere.",roshad684,2011-03-01,122005,2011-03-21,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

We had reserved a double deluxe room with a view but got a double without a view.

"“Great location” Stayed at this hotel in March for 5 nights. Got a free upgrade to a corner room on 35th floor with great views of city, Empire State, Chrysler and Hudson River by e-mailling request before we travelled.
Hotel is in a great location right next to Penn Station. We got the Air Train from JFK then subway from Jamaica to Penn on the E line for 7 dollars total.
Staff at the hotel are all pleasant and helpful and rooms are clean. Beds are comfortable.
Only bad comment about the bedroom and bathroom is the size. We have been to NY lots of times but this room was the smallest we have had. It was really cramped.
Tick-tock diner next to the hotel is very reasonable and food was excellent although service one day was bad.
Just up the road on 37th/8th Avenue is a great pub called The Houndstooth. Staff are really friendly, food is good (especially the fish and chips) and drinks are reasonable with good choice of beers and wines and Happy Hour. Caters to lots of different age groups. 
Please DO NOT visit the Ginger Man pub. It has some good reviews but we found it to be crowded and full of pretentious yuppies. Bar staff were unfriendly and unhelpful and not up to the job. Saw one barmaid pour 4 pints of froth before managing to pour a pint.! They advertise that they sell real ales. They had 3 on when we visited but the barman did not know what they were without referring to a printed sheet and then they only served them in halves even though they were not strong beers. This means that a pint costs 15 dollars! 
As we have been to NY lots of times before we did a few different things we can recommend. We took the subway to Coney Island and had a good hot dog in a famous fast food place and then walked to Brighton Beach which has to be seen. The place has been taken over by Russians and all the shops in the high street only have Russian signage.
We also took a 3 hour Circle Line boat trip around Manhattan Island. This was a good trip for 35 dollars and the north of the island is surprising.
We walked the High Line and then into Greenwich and Chelsea Market. and we also took the subway to 110th street and walked the entire length of Central Park.
Went to a big band jazz concert at Birdland which was good.
Also did a Comedy Club on 53rd Street which turned out to be OK in the end but be warned-do not get your tickets from vendors in the Times Square area as they lie and tell you that you can turn up at any time to see a show. We turned up on a Saturday for the 9pm show and although we arrived in plenty of time at 8pm we couldn't get in as we hadn't booked. We complained and they eventually let us in to the 8.30 show which was packed and had already started. It was a good show however just make sure you book direct with the club before you go and don't listen to the touts in Times Square.
Macys had an incredible sale while we were there.

"“Very comfortable and welcoming, in a great location!” We had a great time at this hotel and would recommend it to anyone staying in New York for its good location and quiet comfy rooms. The rooms were small but no smaller than any other New York hotel - this is what they are all like. The beds were gorgeous and the bathroom had a great shower. The only noise we could hear were occasional sirens in the street below but not loud enough to keep us awake. No noise from any other rooms whatsoever and the hotel was very busy.
Check in and out was hassle free and Mohammed on reception was especially welcoming and friendly. No problems with the bill or anything and we got a good room on a high floor which is what I had requested.
One of the best hotel facilities was the tick tock diner which served fantastic breakfast and desserts. They also had a full menu for 24 hours which we did not use but looked great. Service in all areas of the hotel was very efficient and all the staff wanted to chat and ask questions which we thought was really nice.
The hotel feels very safe as they check your key cards as you go into the lifts and there are 2 locks and latch on the room doors.
The hotel is located on 34th street and 8th ave which we found was a great street for shopping, on that road they had Macys, Victorias Secret, Borders, Aeropostale and numerous souvernir shops. It was also well placed for wandering out to Times Square in the evening, not too tiring at all at the end of the day!
We would definately stay here again as we really enjoyed our 5 nights and we thought the price was great value as we found other hotels at 3* rating which were much more expensive. This hotel does great deals on its own website so it is worth looking at this as well as another site like booking.com.",claire87d,2011-03-01,122005,2011-03-17,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Would definately stay here again!!!!!!” My wife and I have just returned from a 10day round trip to New York and the hotel was fantastic
Like most of you, selecting the best place to stay in New York is probably the hardest thing of all. Having been to New York before (and staying up next to Central Park West) this trip we wanted to stay near midtown but further down for the night life.
We had eight nights in the New Yorker which was only £888 for the two of us. The room had everything you required, it was very clean and the bed was very confortable, there is all the usual amenities e.g. hair dryer, ironing board and iron, climate control and a lovely en-suite.
The bed was made each day and fresh towels were provided, there was an ice-machine in the small vending area next to the lift lobby on our floor and an ice bucket in the room which was ideal for a bottle of wine before going out on an evening.
The hotel is at 34th and 8th street right next to Macy's and Madison Square Garden. It was about a 5-10minute walk to Times Square and the theatre district (which is you've been to New York before you'll know it''s best to be just outside this area instead of slap-bang in the middle of the mayhem!)
The other perks to the hotel is the Tick Tock 24hr diner and also the bar/restaurant which both served very good food if you arrive late in the day and don't have time to explore.
Being on 34th street was great as you're only a 20minute walk into Chelsea, we walked everywhere and only occasionally got a taxi late at night to get back to the hotel. Penn street station is literally over the road from the hotel (underground of-course) so you don't even know it's there, but this is great for getting down the bottom of manhattan or over to Brooklyn Heights etc. You're also only 5-10mins away from the Prt Authority Bus Terminal and the main Gray Line building (best sightseeing buses).
If you're there for longer than a couple of days definately go to the Woodbury Common outlet - it's $42 from the Port Authority Bus terminal and takes an hour but the prices for designer clothes will take your breath away!! My wife bought UGG's for £60 and I bought clothes in Ralth Lauren and North Face for less then half the price they are back in the UK - you'll probably need a full day there as there are hundreds of stores inc Gucci, Prada, etc
If you're looking for somewhere to go out on a night we went to Soho and Greenwich Village which were great for food and drink, also try the East Village (St Mark's Place and the Curry Mile (6th Street between 1st and Second Ave) the Brick CurryHouse is mega!
If you want to sightsee, buy a Gray Line 48 or 72hr pass for all loop buses you can get on and off and also includes Empire State Building tickets and you can go to Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island - think it's about $84 per poerson but well worth it as the buses go all over and you see lots more in a shorter space of time. We used them a a 'reccy' to check out areas to go back later to or to get off and then walk across town and get on another bus to another area.
Get yourself over the Brooklyn Heights and the DUMBO area if you want a nice day out and fantastic view of the Manhattan Skyline - we got the red line subway over and then walked back over the Brooklyn Bridge which is about 1.5miles but a lovely walk for a mild or sunny day.
Overall - back to the hotel - we would definaly stay here again and are aplnning another shopping trip either later on in the year or next year!!",mackemken,2011-03-01,122005,2011-03-16,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

I keep hoping it will be better. The room is small but that is okay if it is clean and efficient. But that is not the case. The bathroom is so small I could barely fit and the hot water was not consistent. I had a meeting booked in the Wall Street Suite. Don't do it. The second floor is falling apart and looks like it will fall down around you at any minute. I tried to call the front desk a number of times and never was able to get through. The best thing about this place is the greasy spoon (and I mean greasy spoon!!) this is open next door.

"“Great Staff is what makes a Great Hotel! Impeccable staff and beautiful, historic building = NYC perfection” First, my apologies - This review is long overdue!!! My several experiences at the New Yorker however have always been great so that i would be remiss if i did not share a review!
Upon arriving at the hotel the door men are lovely and very welcoming. When entering the hotel you will be struck by it's beauty and fantastic art-deco style and architecture. It gets way better though once you reach check-in - the desk staff is amazing! Simarrah and Mohammed are exceptionally gracious and accomodating - they are the kind of people who make you feel very, very special and always greet you with a warm and genuine smile and welcome. The front desk can be a busy place but Simarrah and Mohammed have always provided me with their undivided attention and always make me feel like a VIP! I always look forward to seeing them. The rooms have great overhead art-deco style light fixtures but are a little on the smallish side. But as i am always in NYC for meetings though i travel alone so i usually have a cozy and tidy room with one bed. Being somewhat claustrophobic though i usually request a corner room which the hotel has always graciously provided me with - 2 windows in bed area but the best part is the additional window in the bathroom - so much wonderful natural light! While enjoying the great breakfast with spectacular views on the 39th floor i have spoken with other guests, who more often than not are repeat visitors, and hear that the hotel has lovely rooms with 2 beds as well as suites - some of the suites have 2 bedrooms and baths and some others have outdoor patios/terraces. With the awesome skyline views you get at the New Yorker having a terrace/patio would be an absolute dream! Several times i have had a view of the Chrysler building from my bed - my favorite building in NYC - it's beauty at night is breathtaking! Whatever room you stay in though you can be assured that it will be tidy and impeccably clean as the housekeeping staff is wonderful -very friendly and warm with wonderful attention to detail. The beds are fantastic - very comfortable - better than my bed at home! As a solo female traveler i particularly appreciate the secure feeling i have in the hotel. You must show your room key in order to reach the elevator area and you are always greeted by the security staff with a smile. My trips are usually short so i don't venture too far from the hotel (my office is basically across the street) because everything is close by! Large drug store across the way, Starbuck's across the street, fast food close by, fast casual dining close by and when i need some stockings or make-up Macy's is just right around the corner - Penn Station is also very close so the location of the hotel could not be any better! The hotel also has two in-house restaurants - the upscale Cooper's Tavern which has an elegant and sophisticated feel but whose prices, even for a perfectly cooked steak with all the trimmimgs, still falls within my daily per diem :) and the fun and funky Tick-Tock Diner which is open 24 hours.
Travelling solo for business can be somewhat lonely but the staff at the New Yorker feels like extended family so i always look forward to my stays there. i will be there in a week or so and this time i am bringing my brother with me for a special celebration and i can't wait to show him the hotel as he and i are both art-deco and architecture lovers.
If you have a chance read up on the history of the hotel - fascinating! Movie stars from Hollywood's Golden Age, Nikola Tesla and his pigeon - very interesting stuff! I have even collected some New Yorker Hotel memorabilia from eBay and plan to pass it along to the hotel staff as i heard that someone with the hotel collects such items.
I just can't say enough good things about the New Yorker hotel and can't wait to get back there!!! If you stay at this hotel you won't be disappointed - beauty, history, value, incredible staff and location - obviously, i highly recommend it!!!!!

"“Excellent hotel but don't request a standard bedroom!” I recently returned from a 5 night stay in the New Yorker which I must admit was very pleasant despite a bit of a dodgy start! Having booked a twin room, we were aghast to discover that we had been put into a ""standard bedroom"" which was awful to say the least! The room is so small that it just about holds a double bed and nothing else so I returned to reception and spoke to the very helpful lady who checked me in and was moved to a large 2 double bed twin room which was lovely. It was clean and comfortable and although we were on the corner of 8th Avenue and 34th Street, the noise was fine.
In terms of the hotel itself, the location is excellent and I would definitely look at this again if I were returning to New York. Its situated in Midtown which is the perfect base for all types of holidays. The hotel is very art deco in style and has recently been refurbished. We did have a problem with the heating in our bathroom but within 15 minutes of calling housekeeping, this was sorted out.
The Tick Tock diner is perfect for 24 hour food and Coopers Bar is an excellent place to meet fellow holiday makers.

"“Excellent Location” I have just returned from 7 nights in this hotel and loved every bit about it.
We arrived at 2pm (check in opens at 3pm) and asked if we could leave our bags somewhere so that we could go for lunch and after checking the system we were able to check in straight-away, another couple wo arrived before at the same tie as us, weren't able to check in and had to wait around until 3pm.
Yes our room was small but in New York you should never expect spacious rooms. We had room to hang some clothes and drawer space and cases were kept neatly out of the way. We spent very little time in our room so it was fine. We were on the 20th floor with a building view, again i didn't go to sit in my room and admire the view, we went to see the city. We heard very little noise from the street, just the odd siren/horn late at night, nothing which kept us awake or woke us.
Rooms were nice and clean with towels replaced on our request. Air co in room was nice and quiet and easy to use. Only downside to the room was the draft which came in through the windows, however as soon as curtains were drawn you couldn't feel it. 
The hotels location is amazing, situated on the corner of 8th Av/34th St opposite Madison Square Gardens and 3 blocks away from Empire State Building. Macy's is a 5 minute walk and Times Square less than 10 mins. The subway is on the corner next to the Tick Tock diner (this is also worth a visit).
I have already recommeded this hotel to relatives and will be staying again when i next visit NYC!

"“Ok stay but hotel staff not helpful or honest and they don't care” The hotel was overall ok. It was clean but the service was not very good. For the price and location, it was a good deal. The reason I gave it a poor rating was that I promptly called after noticing I was missing my cashmere pants and no one wanted to help me. I spoke with housekeeping several times and they never returned my call. I finally called to file a report with security and I was told they would return my call and I am still waiting. I was never offered compensation for the pants mising from my room. I was planning on staying in December 2011 to take my mom for a girls weekend but their lack of honesty and service changed my mind.",any0529,2011-01-01,122005,2011-03-08,False,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great hotel - brill location and comfy room.” My husband and I recently stayed at The New Yorker Hotel and we were really happy with the experience. The location is great – it’s walking distance to a handful of attractions like Madison Sq Gardens, Time’s Square, 5th Ave and Macy’s. It’s also opposite Penn Station. The room we were given was very clean and small, but not undersized. It didn’t have a kettle, safety deposit box or fridge but we didn’t mind this. (I think the hotel reception has deposit boxes but we never enquired) It did however have Cable TV, a fast working and quiet central heating/air conditioning unit, free wifi, a hairdryer and a daily stock of small toiletries. We requested a room higher up as the hotel is on a busy road so we didn’t want to hear any traffic. This paid off as our room was v. quiet. 
There’s a restaurant connected to the hotel called Tick-Tock. It’s a 24 hour American diner where we used to have breakfast. Service was v fast and friendly and the food was tasty. 
Hotel staff were good. We didn’t have any booking issues and we hardly spoke to them once we checked in. There’s a free useful guide book at reception which comes in handy as it’s got good maps, advice and addresses of places to visit. 
The hotel offers a service of looking after your belongings once you have checked out and have a late flight. Each piece of luggage is charged at $1. You pay 50cents when you check it in, and 50cents to check it out.
It was quite easy to find a cab outside the hotel. Charges to JFK airport were $50 incl toll charges. (but always make sure you agree the price before you get in)",fdeva,2011-03-01,122005,2011-03-04,False,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“No frills hotel, very average but good if you just want a place to stay” Booked this hotel through Expedia so came in a package deal. I have never been to New York but my partner and I decided to do Christmas in NYC 23rd to 28th Dec. I was super excited. I read some reviews on this hotel and they were mixed but decided to go with the package regardless, we only wanted a place to sleep, we planned to be out and about the entire trip.
First impression of the hotel as we walked through the revolving doors was good, until I reached the reception where the receptionist was less than friendly or welcoming,..they say the Brits are unfriendly...jees! Having knocked the excitement out of me, after a near argument over the name the booking was made in, we eventually checked in (even though we were told it was too early by the rather hostile receptionist). 
The room was a queen room. I read on a review to expect these rooms to be small, but that is saying something. To be honest though, we really didn't mind, we didn't spend any time in the room apart from one night when the snow storm hit on the 26th.
The rooms were cleaned everyday and the standard of that was brilliant. The room was comfortable and quiet. That's all you need in NY really or your going to the wrong city my friend!
The ticktock diner adjoining the hotel we were told was not the best. It was brilliant, so ignore comments on this. It's busy and not massively friendly, but it is so busy, the service is quick, it serves a purpose and the food was good and reasonably priced.
One big piece of advice I would give is to get a yellow cab if going to JFK. The hotel facility is expensive, and even the porter was trying to railroad us into using it and talk us out of getting a cab, he tried very hard knowing we were from the UK! The cabs can only charge $50 max and that is exactly what we paid, just make sure the cabby agrees before you get in!
Overall, a comfortable hotel to stay in if you just want a bed for the nights you are staying. Ignore the porter trying to rip you off and expect a hostile greeting from the receptionist!",wellywoo2002,2010-12-01,122005,2011-03-03,False,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great Hotel in Fantastic Location” This was the second time we stayed at The New Yorker - the first being several years previous, prior to their refurb - our initial visit was good and this latest one proved positive as well.
It's in a great location; the service was very good; everywhere was very clean; good value; nicely decorated rooms. What more could you ask for ?
The only downside was that the rooms were quite small.
We tried the attached Tick Tock Diner but preferred The Skylight Diner just around the corner.

"“Outstanding Location! Reasonable Prices! BIG Thumbs Up!” I have specifically signed up to Trip Advisor just to write the review of this hotel as I was so pleased with our say.
We originally arrived for a 4 night stay, but the day we were due to fly home, the volcano brought all flights down to the ground. Our room for the first 4 nights was quite small, but we were there for a sleeping, nothing else, and after the busy days you have in a 5 day trip, you could sleep in an elevator! The room was cosy and comfortable, but we had some very noisy girls mucking around in the corridors at 3am which was annoying, but it didn't effect us too much, although the constant door slamming was annoying. However we got our own back when we came back to the hotel to drop something off around midday and we could hear loud snoring coming from one room with a do not disturb sign on the door. We knew it was these girls room, so I decided to wake them up by knocking on the door. I'm vengeful like that.
Anyway, the hotel is in a superb location, and everything like empire state building, broadway, madison square garden and times square are within walking distance from the hotel lobby! The staff are helpful but a bit mute. We eventually noticed the reasons why, they work 15 hour shifts some of them, and simply aren't as excited about your trip as you are, but they do their job to a good standard. 
Now, when our flights were cancelled, we were stranded. The hotel couldnt book us in as they were fully booked. So we had to stay in a very cheap hotel not too far away for one night. We rang the hotel that night to book in for the next day, and they got us a room. We had to keep booking everyday as we didn't know when our flights home would be. They eventually called our room to say we need to come down first thing every mornng to rebook (we didnt want to book in block until we knew flight times and dates). They again ran out of rooms and therefore put us in a penthouse suite on the very top floor. FOR THE PRICE OF A STANDARD ROOM! We were eventually here for 2 weeks in that room until our flight out. The suites are just unbelievable, you feel like a celebrity once in there. If you have room in your budget, just stay in one for one night! It's about double the cost of a standard room, but so so posh! The hotel staff are easily charmed. The hotel was clean, and the staff (once charmed and slight jovial banter) were extremely friendly and helpful, especially if you show your gratitude in return. 
You have things like McDonalds and Tick Tock Diner right on your doorstep, so for breakfast or a quick meal these places are great and the food at Tick Tock was Tip Top in my opinion. Road traffic outside would only affect you if you were quite low down, but like I say if your days our busy as ours were, you won't really notice. They have a gym downstairs for guests and students that live there. (We knew a student living there who is the daughter of a guy we work with). 
In short I'd highly recommend this hotel, we went back there for a reason when we got stranded, as the location was superb, it was clean, and quiet to an extent. We have raved about this to anyone who has gone to New York, all of them have come back with favourable reviews of the hotel. Please ignore all bad reviews, our stay here wasn't perfect, no stay will ever be truly perfect, but at The New Yorker, it was easily the best hotel we have stayed in in New York. (I have been to New York 4 times before this trip).

"“Small but with plenty of style” Hotel itself has a lovely art deco feel throughout. Check in was straightforward and friendly, the rooms were small though but if you're going to New York to spend time in a hotel room then I would think that there's something wrong! That said, the bed was VERY comfortable (and I'm fussy about beds!) and very welcome after a day pounding the NY pavements. The location cannot be faulted, really close to numerous subway stations and 1 block from Macys, 10 minute stroll to Times Square/Broadway theatres. The only thing that was disappointing for me about the hotel was the shower, the water temperature was very unreliable (switching between scalding hot or freezing cold) which was not good when at the end of a long New York day all you wanted was a nice hot shower, however I soon discovered that a bath was the way forward, there was always plenty of hot water to fill a bath so this was soon overcome. 
The Tick Tock diner attached we had breakfast in and can highly recommend the buttermilk pancakes with strawberries, very very tasty and again friendly staff. We arranged a collection from the airport through the New Yorker Rides, John called us in the UK before we went in order to go through all the details and it was nice when we eventually got through the immigration to know that our trip to the hotel was all sorted out, again cannot fault the driver who gave us little local tips which proved useful during our stay. 
Overall the location and the cleanliness of the hotel was great, room size and shower were the only things that stopped me giving this hotel a higher rating.",JodyBiscuit,2011-02-01,122005,2011-02-28,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“new york wow hotel great x” We paid around $100 a night and well worth it. Check in at 3pm was not able to do this earlier but rooms to drop your bags. Check in was quick and easy. No safe in the room but apparently they have them behind reception. The room was tiny but cleaned every day. Shower was great clean towels every day. The beds are so comfy Free wifi. Heating and AC are quick and easy to use. We also only left 2 hours to get the plane back, we should of left 3 ! the hotel quickly booked a cab and told them to rush! we made it phew ! cab from JFK was $55 and back to newark was $80. Tick tock diner was right next door and open 24hrs, this was good quick service but not fussy. You have to show your key to get in the lift which i thought was a great security thing. Gym was great. Penn subway 2 mins walk away and this is a great way to get around $2.50 to get most places. (I was scared about going thougt it would be horrid down there but it isnt at all) Hotel right near Macys (the give 10% off for being a visitor so take your boarding ticket or passport) and the empire state building. If you want to go to the statue of liberty book months in advance to go up to the crown as it gets booked up months in advance. We tried to plan our trip but the best advice we were givern was to just go with the flow and enjoy thats what we did, it was great. Great designer outlet shop called centery 21 (472 86TH) near groud zero and it is cheap as chips. A must if you are shopping. The rockafella center also a must fab views and the best was going to see chicargo on broad way breath taking x 2 great reatarants The rocking horse cafe 182 Eighth Ave (at 19th St),( mexican food) and Becco 355 W 46th St (Italian) Both have great food, service and atmosphire and for the two of us including drink was around $70. Becco also made sure that our food was quick so we were able to make our show. So all in all cant wait to go again only been back a day and want to book would def stay there again.

"“Excellent Hotel” My lady and I stayed at this hotel week ending 27th Feb 2011. I emailed the hotel reservation desk prior to our arrival they responded by upgrading our room which would give us a better view of NYC, upon arrival we was promptly checked in and received the key card to our room, our hotel room was on the 33rd floor facing the heart of the city with views of empire state building directly in front of us. The room was small but in comparison to other hotels in NYC it’s the average size unless you buy a suite, the room was clean the bathroom was decent and the bed was comfy. 
The hotel is located 34th ST. 8 Avenue which is in the middle of the shopping district you got Macy’s, Manhattan mall, footlocker a few blocks away and loads of restaurants/fast food places to eat (depending on your budget) the hotel location was excellent, there is so many things to do Time square is a short walk away, cinema and Madison square garden across the road from the hotel as a tourist couldn’t ask for me. As for the museums and statue of liberty you will either need to get a taxi (which is cheap) or the subway to get there as walking from midtown west could take a while. 
The hotel staffs was friendly and very polite, the security is good as you will need to show your room card before you are allowed to enter the elevator and the gift shop is cheap. 
It was a nice hotel and I would recommend to anyone who is going NYC for a short holiday.

"“Great Location” We stayed here for 4 nights and arrived past midnight to check in. Staff were friendly and efficient with our check in. Arriving at our room it was quite small but this is New York, space is very expensive, plus you don't go to New York to stay in your room. It was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We were on the 26th floor so noise from the street (mainly sirens) could be heard but not enough to keep you awake at night. There was an issue with our window though, it didn't seem to be sealed properly so a draft came in and there was a whistling sound. The draft was combated by the air conditioning and the sound again wasn't loud enough to keep you awake all night.
The location was perfect; a short walk from Times Square, Subway on the corner, near Madison Square Gardens and the Empire State building.
Checking out was straight forward and they kept our cases for us during the day, as our flight was in the evening. It cost us $1.50 to put them in and $1.50 to get them out. I read in previous reviews that it was $1.50 per item however it was $1.50 per room (we left 2 cases and a large bag).
The Lobby was beautiful, internet was free to print boarding passes, gift shop was nice but the Tick Tock Diner was a saviour. Being attached to the hotel and not knowing any good places to eat on your first jet-lagged morning made it a perfect choice (see my review of the Diner for full details)",sedona_47,2011-02-01,122005,2011-02-28,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“We didn't want to leave!” I just got back from a three night/four day trip to NYC for Canadian University's reading break. We stayed at the New Yorker and LOVED it! I booked through Hotwire about 2 weeks prior to our check in date and got an unbelievable rate of $83/night. 
Check in was smooth and there were no problems. We were especially impressed because we were allowed into our room at 10am as we arrived on an early overnight bus. Such a nice surprise because we expected to be storing our bags and coming back at 3 pm for check in. It made our first day so much easier to be able to go up to the room and freshen up before a day of travelling. 
I had requested a room as high up as possible (to maximize views) and boy did we get one! Great view of the skyline and empire state building from two windows in our corner room. The beds were lovely - very comfortable and nice linens. Large flat screen tv and lots of room to unpack in closet and around the room. We may have had a larger room than most get as we had a corner, we found the size just right. We were very comfortable, and although we didn't spend much time in the room, it felt like home. 
As other reviewers had mentioned, the bathrooms are small and a little tired looking but VERY clean which was my main concern. The rooms were perfectly cleaned daily by housekeeping staff. 
Location is awesome. Right on the subway line at Penn Station gets you anywhere you want to go, and Times Square is a mere 10 minute walk. Macy's is also just around the corner which we took full advantage of as is Starbucks - perfect way to get a long day of sightseeing going! 
We had a fabulous time and much of this had to do with our comfort and ease at the hotel. Will definitely return!",sapirie17,2011-02-01,122005,2011-02-27,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“A fab hotel, helpful staff in a great location. We loved it!” We have just returned from our first holiday in the States and what an amazing time we had! Flew in to JFK and it was a flat $50 from airport to hotel(plus tips),great value! We had read reviews about the rooms in New York being small and I don't know if we were just lucky but our room at the New Yorker was just brilliant, 3 of us sharing had 2 double beds, 2 bathrooms and loads of storage space for clothes.Our room was also spotlessly clean and very comfortable with flat screen tv and alarm clock, only slight problem was that it was near to the lift workings and was a little noisy late at night and first thing in the morning, but it certainly wasn't an issue as it wasn't cause for complaint. On the whole, the Hotel was actually lovely and quiet.Every member of Hotel staff we came into contact with was friendly and helpful. A really great thing at the New Yorker was that safety deposit boxes are free, just ask at reception.It was also great to see that at all times of the day and night there is a member of staff making sure that residents only go up in the lifts to the rooms.There is also a desk in the hotel where you can book theatre and excursion tickets, we made use of this and got tickets to see Mary Poppins, an absolute treat! A wonderful show and the seats were perfect! Every morning we ate at the Tick-Tock Diner ,very reasonable prices, great service and lovely food. There is also a little take away kiosk inside the hotel where you can get muffins,pastries and coffee to take up to your room in the morning. Good location, 15minutes walk straight up the road to The Empire State Building. We booked all of our attraction tickets on-line before we went, this was great as we skipped queues -something that the New York Pass doesn't always do. We have had the time of our lives, people said that going for a week would be too long for us,we would totally disagree! New York is an amazing,vibrant and jaw-dropping place and we can't wait to go back and wouldn't hesitate to stay at the New Yorker!!",LisyB,2011-02-01,122005,2011-02-27,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“great location, quite rude staff at front desk” i found my stay in the new yorker pleasant enough. room was small, though clean and all appliances were in good working order.
check in took quite a while, and when we were up we found the staff very blunt, rude and sharpe. they seemed annoyed when we didnt know the safe key system (although they didnt explain anything to us about it) the only other time i needed assistance (left both room cards in thr room) i found the lady to be very rude and a lecture from her was not apreciated.
the diner connected to the hotel called tick tock was excellent, staff freindly and the food excllent.
location was great, walking distance to times square. as 1st timers to nyc it wtas great location

"“Great hotel!” My mother and I stayed her whilst I was on my New york trip and very enjoyed it. We had a twin room both with double beds, which were very comfortable and clean. Bedroom wasn't too big or too small. Bathroom was nice, as well as the amenities. When we booked in we had very friendly and welcoming staff, with a huge very grand lobby. Had a business centre which allowed us to print our boarding passes of free of charge! Nice gift shop. Brilliant location, wasn't to far from times square or fifth avenue. There was the odd noise of the air conditioned, but managed to sleep right through it. Great value, we were on the 20th floor, and had no problem getting up there. There was a slight problem with or room card not letting us in, but they fixed it for us. We went up to the Sky lounge on the 39th floor which had superb views. The tick tock diner was joint onto the hotel which was ok. The assistance was very nice, we had got there by taxi and had someone open the door for us and offered to carry our luggage. Would defiantly recommend to friends and family. We didn't have a great view, but if we looked the other way there was a slightly better one.

NIcely furnished, (flat screens in both the living room and the bedroom!) and very accommodating staff (asked for a Keurig and they put one in the suite before I got there.. nice service.) The Tick Tock diner was great for a fast breakfast; they even had Irish bacon !

"“all in all, I'd stay there again...” My wife and I spent 7 days in that hotel to celebrate 8 years of marriage. Although the hotel was built in the 20's, when you get inside it doesn't look so old fashion. As a matter of fact it's got a beautiful lobby, well decorated. The elevators are big and fast. You don’t have to wait long for them, and once you get it, in a few seconds you are in you floor. The room we stayed is really small, but cozy. The location is great, near the Metro and bus stations.

“Great for a girls weekend” Stayed at The New Yorker with 3 other friends for a weekend get away. We reserved one of the package deals that the hotel was offering. Check in was simple and the vouchers and gift cards we were to receive as part of the package were waiting for us. I didn't have to ask or remind the receptionist what was due to us. That was nice. Hotel room was fine. Decor was nice. Room was small but it is New York so I expected it to be on the smaller size. Bathroom needs a complete renovation but it was clean. I have yet to find a hotel in New York where the bathroom doesn't leave a lot to be desired. Rate for the room was mid-priced. So if you can't afford lux accomodations (and I can't) this hotel was fine for our purpose. Location was very central (Times Square/Chelsea). Short cab rides to Village and SoHo and other areas in NYC for shopping. Hotel bar was nice. Good place for a quick drink before dinner or after shopping. Reasonable prices and plenty of seating.,Kel_6956,2011-02-01,122005,2011-02-24,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Lovely Hotel, Can't Wait To Return!” Having stayed here in September 2010, I would highly recommend this hotel to others!
Yes the hotel was pretty pricey but where isn’t in NYC? 
The Tick-Tok diner was fabulous, staff were all lovely, quick-easy-cheap meals! 
I can completely disagree with other guests regarding check-in, my check-in was fast and I must say I was upgraded upon arrival. 
The room was modern and well equipped, yes the rooms aren’t the largest but once again this is NYC! But the views were to die for – 34th Floor – Room 11.

“Impersonal hotel in good location” The hotel is right next to Penn station so is convenient for rail travellers. But the lobby is a bit like a railway station and I found showing my hotel room to a guard (to get access to the lifts) rather depressing. The rooms were a bit old and sparsely furnished - an in-room safe would be an improvement.

"“Nice hotel, great location.” I was in NYC to visit some friends and do some shopping and decided to go with the New Yorker based on its location, price and the services offered. I turned up before the check in time to see if I could dump my luggage in their storage room, but the receptionist found me a room and checked me in early, which was nice of her. 
The room itself was a fair size with a nice double bed, the bathroom had a bath/shower combo and was also a good size. Everything was clean and the cleaning staff left it the same why every day when I went out. 
The only thing I think was negative about the hotel was the 512kbps internet connection, which is ridiculously slow, and the $10 they want a day for the faster connection was a little high and they don't seem to offer weekly rates.",Mark L,2011-02-01,122005,2011-02-12,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location.” Having stayed in UK hotels, the room size in the New Yorker is relatively acceptable to me as I was pre-warned that it would be small. Fantastic location as it is almost next door to 37thSt Penn St. , walkable distance to Empire State Building, Times Square, Macy, Madison Avenue...Very nice and spacious lobby which added a luxury taste to it. Thankfully i arrived at a non-peak time where I was served pretty quickly and efficiently. No hassle of queuing and waiting to check in as i had seen at other times there were huge crowds of tour groups hanging about at the lobby. So it was a smooth sailing for me. Let's talk about the room. First good news- WIFI IS FREE!! and it was FAST. That's one brownie point for them as i used them to skype with my family and the connection was fantastic. Room was clean and get made up everyday. Comfortable bed- not too soft or too hard. Average size maybe 20 inch lcd tv on the wall which you are not gonna utilise that much if you are on holiday in NYC. Unfortunately the room does not come with any coffee/tea facilities such as kettle and when you ask for one- they only have a mini espresso coffee machine/filter where u need to pour water into it , switch it on and wait for the water to drip into a cup to get the hot water. So if u need hot water- bring your own kettle and cups. The hotel only provides you paper cup. I am a very light sleeper- yes to the extent i can't stand clock ticking. Good news the room is quiet but to be honest i did ask a room on a higher floor and away from the elevator. So make sure u drop a note to them when u book for your room if u are a light sleeper too. Good curtains to block the sunlight. Another 'MUST' have for me as i suffer from migraine therefore it is a plus point for me and especially it always helps when you are jetlagged too! Anyway overall yes i would recommend and always come back to this hotel.",YvesInUK,2010-09-01,122005,2011-02-11,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Lovely, clean hotel in the centre of it all” Stayed at this hotel for my husband's surprise 40th Birthday treat. Found it through a great deal with Cheep Breaks, stayed for 3 nights. Although the room was on the small side, it was lovely and clean,the bathroom had a powerful shower to wake you up in the morning. We slept well in the comfiest bed, despite the sirens that go off in the streets below! Location was fabulous, within walking distance of the Empire State, Times Square, Macys and 5th Avenue, we walked everywhere so we didn't miss anything, although the hotel is opposite the Subway. Maccy D's opposite if you want or need a Big Mac!
Good view of the hotel from the top of the Empire State.
Would recommend the Houndstooth Pub 3 or 4 blocks down 34th street, great food and friendly atmosphere. 
The bar attached to the front of the Hotel is very nice although a bit pricey.
Would love to stay there again if we are ever as lucky as to visit this fantastic city again, we love NY! Would recommend to anyone.",cahullfc,2011-01-01,122005,2011-02-10,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Hotel, Fantastic Location.....” We recently stayed at the New Yorker Hotel for my 30th birthday present. 
We flew into JFK, and took a taxi to the hotel, which cost around $45 + tip. (iirc)
We drove past the Empire State Building, on the way to the hotel, which was fantastic, as that was where I had proposed to my fiance, in the january before. 
We arrived at the hotel, which was an imposing building, even in the city of New York. 
Doorman promptly opened the door and showed us to the desk.
We were about 1 1/2 hour early for check in, just to see if we could check in early, we were politelytold we couldnt but could leave our lugage in a store room, and were given a ticket for it. 
We went out for a walk, and picked up some snacks. We had previously been to New York, so knew how the city was. 
We returned later to the hotel to see a large queue at the reception, but there were about 5 people working the desk, so we were promptly dealt with. 
While checking in, the receptionist acknowledged that it was my birthday, and said that she would upgrade us to a better room. All this went well. 
We then went to our room, via the lifts, which you have to show your room card before, to be allowed to the lifts, so a nice bit of security. 
Lifts to the left go to the 1st 20 floors, and lifts to the right go to the 2nd 20 floors, if i remember. 
We got to our room, and I will say i was a little shocked. it was smaller than I had imagined it, with just a double bed, and a very small wardrobe, with bathroom. 
Dont get me wrong, there is no issue with the room, and it was enough for us to live in whilst we were there. (Previous hotel we had was only a small hotel, but we had 2 kingsize beds in a massive room) I just expected larger. 
We lived out of our suitcases, whilst there, so this took up a little of the floor room. But dont most of us live out of our suitcases?
The rooms were clean, I'm not a fussy person, and I wont moan about the decor etc. its a hotel, built 80 years ago (ago the decor didnt look 80 years old!) I dont expect it to be fully modern, and I'm glad it wasnt. 
It was clean, it had a bed and a bathroom, thats enough for me. 
The view we had from the room, was fantastic, we could only just see the Empire State, as it was behind another building, but we could see for miles. 
We could see:
The Chrysler building, 
we over looked Madison Square Garden's, 
Two tall glass towers, which were at Times Square i believe (cant remember the name sorry)
Metlife, 
Just to name a few, It was a fantasic view. 
The only disappointing thing about the hotel, was that there are no room safes. There are safety deposit boxes in the lobby, which are behind reception, and you have to sign in each time. So you have to queue, then sign a form, and then wait until the room is empty. There are around 40- 60 larger boxes, and maybe 200 smaller boxes. (I may be wrong) Although these were free, which was good. 
The smaller were slightly wider than a passort, but were quite deep. These are only for money and passport storage, or small camera's. 
The larger boxes, are a little bigger, but you wont fit a SLR camera in one. 
The hotel lobby is a big room, which was nicely decorated for christmas, and there are toilets, and a gym downstairs, which you need your room cards for. 
There is also a computer room, which you can use for free to print out your boading passes etc. ( general Internet use is also available here, but there is a charge for that)
Just off to the left of the lobby is a doorway through to the Tick Tock Diner, which we used twice, and I wasn't as impressed as other reviews of it. 
Free Daily wifi upto 500kb, i think. This was fine,. 
When leaving the hotel, there was a gap of about 8 hours between checking out, and us leaving, so we stored our luggage again, but this time, you had to pay to get it back 1 1/2 dollars per item. 
But they organised a car to take us back to the airport, and this turned out cheaper than a taxi. 
All in, I had a fantastic time in the New Yorker, then staff were very helpful, and very polite. 
Would I visit again, probably, there is a subway right outside, which will take you to Times quare, and from there you can pretty much go anywhere. 
Awesome location, great hotel, Fantastic trip. Thanks to all the staff, but thanks to the City and residents of NYC, I love your city.

We had a warm welcome on arrival and were settled within 10 minutes, you are also allowed to take food from outside the hotel back to your room ( you may have left overs from your meal out and can ask for a 'food bag' to take away) the room was very small but modern and clean. On our 2nd day we were unable to get back into out room and after investigating at reception we were told there was a problem with out room and had to move, we were ungraded to a lovely suite for the inconvenience, unfortuantly I left a brand new jumper in the room and never got it back which was a little unsettling as we had only just vacated it :(, over experience was a goodone and hotel staff are helpful at arranging airport transferee and giving advice for use of subway etc x",Everynamebeentaken,2011-02-01,122005,2011-02-06,False,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Perhaps it was lucky, perhaps its just a great undiscovered deal” I recently traveled to NYC on a spontaneous trip with afriend who was going there to a trade show. He made the reservation on one of those online sights where you bid on the room. He bid on the hotel sight unseen and after his bid was accepted he discovered it was The New Yorker. Upon arrival we discovered that although he had said there were two people, we were in fact in need of two beds. The concierege at the front desk upgraded us at no charge to a two bed corner room, at no charge. 
This hotel has been recently refurbished and has a great Art Deco style lobby. It is centrally located at the edge of Chelsea/Hells Kitchen at 36th and 8th, across from Madison Sq Garden, near Macys and The Empire State Bldg, Time Square is walkable in one direction, and The Village in the other. And the Subway is also right there, couldnt be better located.
The room itself was very clean, albeit on the smallish side, but who goes to New york to stay in their room?. With all the scuttle about bedbugs these days, we immediately did a check, not a a sign. The matresses seemed almost new. The bathroom was clean, and stocked with towels, perhaps it could have used a little grout and paint, but hey, no big deal..it was very clean. The housekeeping stafff was friendly and attentive, and never disturbed us.
I would definetly reccomend this hotel to anyone who wanted a centrally located, reasonably priced, very adequate hotel in the city, although I did call later on to check on the price by phone, and it was about %50 more than we paid..so perhaps we were lucky, but the actual price I was quoted was still reasonable for a Manhattan weekend.",Brrrmonter,2011-01-01,122005,2011-02-05,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“No Major Issues, Good Or bad.” We stayed at The New Yorker hotel january 28th - 30th 2011.
We were able to check in early with no problems. Our room was on the 35th floor.
I'm not sure what level the rooms start on but there is not stopping on levels 1-20.
When arriving to our room we found a clean but very small room.
The bathroom was very small.
We only stayed 2 days but if we had stayed longer I believe this would have been an issue. We are a younger couple and didn't mind roughing it out, especially if we can save money but any longer of a stay our particular room was getting cramped. Looking at the map of the hotel our room may have been one of the smallest.
Our rate was fairly cheap for NYC standards but looking back we didn't get much of a room. We also used Priceline.com, 
The bathroom was clean. It had a VERY small toilet. I can't stand tiny toilets. The sink was small and there was a very small glass shelf to set items. 
It was a constant battle to get the water temp. acceptable for a showering; I normally can get a nice medium but it was Hot as fire or Cold as Ice (the water)
We didn't pack a blow dryer but the room had one, not a very good one. In fact, it broke but room service sent one up to replace it in 10 mins or less. (Impressed)
The bed was comfortable. Pillows were nice. We were exhausted when we finally got to lay down. But It felt like a great bed.
There was a Small little closet and a few drawers to unpack in.
Location is great. 34th avenue, close to Macys and hundreds of shops and restaurants.
We did not eat at hotel.
The hotel had very good security, we felt safe. there was security on the main level making sure everyone had a room key before they could enter the elevators.
All in all, I probably would stay somewhere else in the future just to try something different in NYC.
 Its a good, clean hotel with great location near times square, madison square garden and everything else NYC has! I want to mention they seemed to have A real nice Staff.",wingslogo84,2011-01-01,122005,2011-02-01,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Unforgettable” The trip to NYC was a surprise that I learned of about 3 hrs before leaving. Although I had been to New York before I obviously had nothing planned and no expectations. Choosing The New Yorker was the first sign that I knew the trip was going to be special. Its a historic, beautiful building centrally located. The lobby was preserved to its original beauty and was the most impressive, as the rooms are very small (but thats to be expected for a hotel built so long ago in Manhattan). I actually don't mind the small room- it was cozy and clean and had the original charm of the era. Like everything in NY, its expensive and thats the main drawback. The TickTock (? I think thats whats its called) cafe was excellent for breakfast and always seemed to be busy. 
Everything about the surprise trip was perfect and reflected my likes- shopping, the hotel, the sites we saw, amazing food at the best restaurants, a gorgeous ring and a wonderful man!",cantstoptravelling28,2010-05-01,122005,2011-01-30,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Location - Great Staff - Very Satisfied” We stayed at the New Yorker over the Christmas and New Year period. Everything about the hotel was fantastic from the staff to the location to the diner down stairs. The rooms were small but most rooms are small in New York and the location of the hotel makes you forget about the size of the room pretty quick. Madison Square Garden is literally across the road, the empire state building is only a few blocks away, so is times square and it's a nice walk to central park. Macy’s is opposite and it’s awesome! The train station is right next to the hotel too which comes in handy. I would highly recommend this hotel!",beqbeq,2010-12-01,122005,2011-01-30,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Family fun: the balcony’s the business!” I travelled with my husband and 2 sons aged 7 and 3 in Sept (sorry for the late posting). We stayed in a New Yorker Suite with 2 Double Beds. I think it was on the 20th floor: this is all important, because of the balcony and view. We paid $315 a night, which is a lot of money – and certainly more than I’ve spent on a room just about anywhere else in the world – but I would say it was well worth it. 
The living area was large with a lounge (which also folded out for a bed, which we didn’t need) and a dining table for 6. There was a desk, free internet access, flat panel TV and a small fridge and the usual miscellaneous furniture.
The bedroom featured two extremely comfortable double beds, with the most beautiful bedding. If I had not been jet lagged I am sure I would have slept wonderfully every night. There was also another flat panel TV, a chest of draws and a large walk in closet. Plenty of hanging space, and although there were several hangers, there are never enough!
The bathroom: it was tiny. And this is my only criticism of the suite. It did have a bathtub, which was large enough for an adult, but there just wasn’t enough space for a family of 4. A particular problem was the issue of storage space. At a minimum, one more shelf and a couple more hooks would be required for our family. Considering just how small the room is, they haven’t done a bad job of refurbishing it when the hotel was renovated. 
So on to the balcony, or terrace... this was my favourite feature of the hotel, and my favourite spot to be. It was a LARGE L-shaped balcony. I’m not exactly sure of the measurements, but you can see from the photos how big it is – especially by NY standards. There was a wrought iron setting with table and 4 chairs. We were on the 20th floor, I think, and had a corner suite facing 134th and 8th. Brilliant! We had an magnificent view of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building a little further in the distance. On the other side, was Madison Square Gardens. This balcony was large enough for us to play “Red Rover” with our boys when we returned home from touring every day and they loved it as much as I did. 
The furnishings and furniture is all in a deco-sympathetic style and while some pieces are probably a bit aged, I think it just contributes to the feel of a ‘hotel of another age’. Something I personally prefer, to another chain hotel.
As others have said, the location was great. Walking distance to Times Square, Macy’s etc and just across the road from Penn station. We found it extremely easy to get around.
Our contact with hotel staff was limited to check in and checkout, both of which went smoothly with no surprises and no long waits. And the maid service was great.
As having somewhere pleasant to sit outside in the evenings – adjacent to our room, where our boys slept – was the most important hotel feature to me, I contacted the hotel directly via email to ask for a guaranteed terrace room. They were happy to book it and put that in writing. (Most other hotels will not “guarantee”).
Overall I would say that our choice of hotel significantly impacted our fantastic experience in NYC. To be able to sit on the terrace, listening to the city sounds (honk, honk) and taking in that amazing view, while enjoying a gin and tonic, once the boys were in bed at night! Special. It really meant I still felt like I was in New York and not couped up in some tiny hotel room.
I loved this place and the only reason I would stay anywhere else should I return to NYC, would be to experience the city from a different location.",Oz4,2010-09-01,122005,2011-01-29,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Magical Thanksgiving” We live locally, but stayed here the night before Thanksgiving, as I had a chance to be in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and had a wonderful experience. We got a great rate from Travelzoo that included a view room and free welcome cocktails for the adults. Mohammed at the front desk treated us like VIP’s from the moment we walked in, which helped it feel so special. He saw our son and how excited he was about the parade, and changed our view so that we had a gorgeous view of the city, and helped us to arrange for late check-out so that I could change for dinner after the parade. Minutes after we checked in, he called to be sure everything was ok, and then waved at us from the front desk every time he saw us walk by. Kudos to him – what amazing service. 
It’s an older property, but our View Deluxe Room with Two Double Beds was huge and well equipped. We’ve stayed in rooms in NYC where you literally had to climb over the bed to get to the bathroom, but we had space to spread out in this room, which also had a desk and chair. The bathroom fixtures are old, and the bathroom is tiny, but everything was clean and totally fine. The rest of the room was renovated in an Art Deco motif. Beds were so comfortable it was difficult to wake up for the 5am balloon handler call.
One of the most magical parts of staying here for Thanksgiving is that it is a central location for the parade, so you can see balloon handlers, clowns, and other “parade people” coming and going all morning. (Only people with room keys are allowed on the room access elevators – with a guard checking them – so it felt secure even though there were hundreds of people in and out of the hotel.) We also could see (and hear) high school bands rehearsing on the street outside at 3am (luckily we were high up and the hotel is old and solid enough that we only heard it faintly), and saw the end of the parade route from the room. It is the perfect place to stay if you’re in the parade – only need to go downstairs for your early morning call. 
The Tick Tock Diner downstairs is convenient but the staff was overwhelmed by the crowds at 5am and completely botched our order. We also got our welcome drinks from the bar at Cooper's Tavern downstairs, where they kindly put them in “go cups” to take back to our room. Looked like everyone was having a good time there.
Parking rates are fair given what you'd pay in NYC but it was only valet one way, when you drop off the car. Pickup is at a garage which is a block away - we had trouble finding it so be sure you know where you're going.",marmtravel,2010-11-01,122005,2011-01-29,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Perfect Location, Great Staff, Nice Amenities” We stayed at the hotel in Mid-January over MLK Day weekend. It was my first time to New York (husband has been a few times for work, but never as a tourist). We loved the city and this hotel.
I called a few days ahead to confirm our reservation. I let the receptionist know it was my first time to NY and would love a room with a view. She was so kind and upon checking in was told by a few staff members that we had one of the best views in the place - how nice! We were on the 34th floor and had a great view of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings. It was really nice of them to do that.
Also, they will hold your luggage for free if you arrive early, as we did.
Room was very clean as was the bathroom and hallways. Never heard noise from neighbors or otherwise. Staff was always happy to help. 
Tick Tock Diner was OK - went for dessert (pie) one night and breakfast another. Nothing to rave about, but nice to have right in the hotel. As others have said, there are many restaurants within a very short walk of the hotel as well.
Location was excellent. Walked all over and just a block from the subway. 
Fitness center was very nice with individual TVs on each of the cardio machines. 
Security was great as well, I always felt very safe in the hotel and the area. Lobby was beautiful.
We highly recommend the New Yorker for a great stay in a beautiful city!",krkchicago,2011-01-01,122005,2011-01-26,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Convenient location and friendly hotel” I have just come back from the New Yorker Hotel and it was a very enjoyable stay, the staff are very friendly and the rooms are cleaned daily . We had a lovely view of the Empire State Building. 
The Hotel is situated within walking distance of Macys, Times Square and the shopping areas whereby there are shows and very good restaurants, the hotel does have its own diner the Tick Tock which is open 24 hours , a lot of people eat at this diner as the food is very good and reasonably priced. , for a short cab ride approx 15 dollars you can go to Soho for the designers shops and also go to China town and Greenwich Village . 
The hotel is very good value for money and it is afe to walk around the streets surrounding the hotel , when I go back to New York I will stay at the New Yorker again.",tinasparkles186220,2011-01-01,122005,2011-01-26,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Best night's sleep in years!!” Stayed here in Summer 2010 with my teenage sister.
The staff are impeccible, very polite and too eager to help.
The trip was a treat celebrating finishing our recent exams, so we asked at reception if there was a chance of an upgrade, which there was - and WHAT a view! 
The location is top notch - just a ten minute walk from Times Square.
We originally had a twin room, but we both got double beds, with the most wonderful plush duvets and pillows. We even emailed the hotel afterwards and asked where they got them from!
I'm a bit of an insomniac, especially on holiday, and I had the best sleep in years - out like a light within minutes!
We ate breakfast every morning at the Tick Tock diner next door, which was always lovely. We recommend the french toast! (The waiters are also very sweet, and since it was during the world cup, they had good banter!)
Security is tight, which is very reassuring to two young girls travelling alone. You're asked to show your keycard to get to your room - but they're still very warm and kind.
The only staff I found to be a bit rude was the concierge. She's good at her job, but was a bit impatient and huffy to some visitors whose first language was not English.

"“Good Hotel, Good Location” We have just returned from a 3 night stay in the new yorker hotel. We arrived 17/01, we were promptly checked in and allocated room 3319. The view from the room was brilliant, we had views of empire state building and madison square gardens. The room we got was a queen with a view, I do not think it was a queen bed but it did not really matter. They could improve the pillows, it was like lying on air. I woke up most mornings with a sore neck and back, but we did do a lot of walking during the day.
The only real con about our visit was this annoying scraping noise, I first thought it was a mouse but on closer inspection it seemed to be coming from the AC unit, we did not report as when we got use to it I could easily block the noise out.
The tick tock diner was excellent, they had lovely breakfast. The hotel is located on 34th street this area has lots of shops including Macy's, GAP, Victoria Secrets, Footlocker. The hotel also had FREE wi-fi in its rooms, which worked out great with my Iphone :)

"“A great Hotel” We arrived on the 30th of December for a 4 night stay, and were immediately impressed by the helpful courtesy of the staff. The room we were allocated was a little on the small side, but was very clean and comfortable and in reality was only a place to sleep in and store our luggage. We liked the art deco styling and enjoyed visiting the 24 hour Diner for a good breakfast and on one occasion an evening meal.
The location was central to most of the places we wanted to go to, and though the neighbourhood looked slightly shabby, we felt safe and not under any threat in fact walking around at night was probably safer than walking around our local town at night.

There is a large fitness area, the location is very convenient, and the beds are comfy. The rooms are very small...not uncommon for NY but it's not as place you want, or could, spend much time.

"“Lovely hotel in a great location!” We stayed at this hotel after getting a great package deal including flights from the UK. We only realised what a good deal we had got when friends tried to book nights at the hotel while we were there and we were suprised at the price.
We arrived at New Yorker after a long, snow affected journey and walked in to the attractive lobby area after being greeted from our taxi by a lovely doorman.
Check in to the room was quick and efficient and we made jokes with the receptionist that he better give us a nice room! We weren't disappointed! We had a room with 2 double (queen) beds on the 20th floor. Not much floor space but we weren't going to be spending much time in the room any way!
View of the Empire State Building from my bed - who could ask for more?
After throwing our bags in the room to go and find food we came back to a message on the room phone from the receptionist asking if the room was ok, it was a sweet gesture.
Bathroom was small but everything you wanted including a pile of towels. The shower itself was always hot and getting the mixer to the right temp was sometimes tricky but nothing serious. 
Now back to the beds - I cannot explain how comfortable these beds were - definately some of the best hotel beds I have ever slept in. I wish I could have brought my bed home with me! Apart from the odd loud police siren (which you are going to get in any city) i could barely hear any street noise from 20 floors up and slept like a baby!
Breakfast in the morning was easy as there is a Starbucks literally accross the street and a McDonalds (there is diner downstairs in the hotel but we didn't use it so I can't comment on it). We also discovered a great restaurant for breakfast 2 mins walk away (across 34th street near entrance to Penn Station) where we ate big breakfasts for $6 each.
In the Basement of the hotel is a gift shop mainly selling NY stuff - but was useful from buying stamps for postcards! Apparently there was a laundry and a gym too down there but we had no time/need for either.
In the lobby was also a Conceirge desk selling tickets for shows/tours/etc. It seemed popular but we again didn't have need for it.
The location of this hotel for a first time visitor to NY was great. We could walk to places like Empire State Building, Times Square, 5th Avenue, Macys, etc - all in under 10 mins. And there were always a line of taxi's outside the door for those further journeys or subway around the corner. 
Oh and I have to mention here our maid (not that we ever saw her) but she was wonderful! Every day after being out all day doing tourist stuff we would come back to the room beautifully tidy (she even folded out Pyjamas for us!).
Wall mounted flat screen tv in the room with quite a good selection of channels - but we usually fell asleep as soon as getting in the lovely beds! lol
Climate control in the room so you could literally choose the exact temperature you wanted.
Free WIFI in the room.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, in fact friends of mine have already booked !",Cleoface,2011-01-01,122005,2011-01-19,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“At least the room was pretty!” We recently stayed at the New Yorker and were very excited after hearing some great reviews. 
Upon arrival I was informed that I would need to give my card details just in case there were any additional charges, ie if we smoked in the room. I was happy to do so and gave my card. The man told me that no money would be taken from my account and that it was a just in case policy. I can confirm that we did not smoke or damage anything in the room.
The room was very nicely decorated and had plenty of cupboard space for a couple. The only downside to the room was that the carpets made us very static, we received many little shocks and our hair would go a little scew wiff!! But other than that, the room was lovely.
The bathroom was ok, a little rough around the edges but ok! I had read reviews saying bring your own towels as the ones provided are tiny but we found them to be fine. I would suggest that anyone going there should either buy soap out there or bring their own as the soap provided made our hands VERY dry and rough. 
I was a little let down by the customer service, upon arrival we were both tired and just wanted to get some sleep. We were not advised on where to go or what floor we were on. Also, I emailed them in advance to find out about hotel transfers as they claimed to offer this service but they simply gave me a contact number to arrange it myself. When we got there, we found that they were able to arrange this for us and it would have taken them about 2 minutes to do so.
Upon our return to the UK we discovered that all was not well. My bank statement showed a pending charge from the hotel. I quickly called Expedia as I was very concerned - we had not damaged anything, smoked in the room or ordered pay-per-view. They called the hotel and informed me that this was a 'security deposit' of approx £186.00 dollars. I was more than concerned at this point as there had been no mention of any deposits at the time of booking or check-in. This means that they had taken money from my account without consent - big no no! They advised that the money was just a deposit and that it was put on hold and would be put back into my account within 3-5 working days. I am still waiting for the money to be returned and am most definately not impressed that they have done this without informing me or with my consent.

"“Tired and Tiny” Overall, our stay at the New Yorker was fine. But I think the headline sums it up most appropriately - tired and tiny. Tired - the paint and carpet in the hallways needed freshening, there was always a musty smell in the hallways (it was a non-smoking floor so can't blame it on cigarette smoke), the place just reminded me of the Hollywood Tower Hotel ride at Disney in FL. Tiny - I'm a firm believer in small rooms at a reasonable price because typically I don't go on vacation to sit in my hotel room, but this room took the cake. There was about 12 inches of room between the end of my bed and the wall. The closet was so small you couldn't even put a suitcase in there for storage - we ended up putting the suitcases on the desk, which I don't even know why that was there because there was no desk chair. The tv was a nice flatscreen but it was in the corner on the dresser and was awkward to watch - could have easily been mounted on the wall in front of the beds. The bathroom reminded me of my grandmother's early 1950's bathroom - pedestal sink, 1950's style tile on the floor and in the shower, and hardly any storage space at all, save for a small glass shelve they installed right above the sink. I know it's NYC, but at $300/night, I would have thought we would have little bit more room. 
The hotel does have a decent gym in the basement of the hotel which was nice - and also a self-serve laundry (weird). Positives - great location, right near Penn Station which has various subway lines and trains. You literally are right in the middle of everything. Starbucks right across the street. Great chinese restaurant about 2 blocks away heading uptown on 8th AVenue, Chef Wu. Tick Tock Diner in the hotel lobby was very good too. Overall, it was an ok hotel.

"“great location for everything.” Sorry for delay in writing review but my friend and I stayed at the New Yorker in early Dec and had a great time. sadly our trip was late starting due to BA's incompetence but hey ho. The hotel is at a great location, close to the subway, Macys and not too far from Times Square. I read the reviews before hand but travel enough to know to take the average rates rather than set to much store by all of them !! the hotel rooms are small but clean and the concierge suggested and booked a great itallian restaurant for us. The only grumpy person was the server at the small coffe bar in the morning, so no tip for him. Great shopping, sightseeing etc the only dissapointment was the memorial at Twin Towers which was poor (my friend wanted to pay her respects) as we thought there would be somewhere to light a candle perhaps ?? trip was fab and a note to anyone who hasn't bought transfers... go by Taxi. its safe, quick and not that expensive if you devide it by Two or more.

"“Great location, but happy it was for only one night.” The hotel is probably one of the best deals for the location alone. You're a short walk away to Times Square, Rockefeller, and tons of shopping. 
We traveled with our 20 lb dog who requires a very small kennel when we're gone. We got to our room, and there was barely enough space for my fiance, myself, and our 2 bags. Luckily the closet was almost like a walk in, so we put the kennel in the closet and left the door of the closet open. Our view also left something to be desired - it was of another hotel room window. If you go to this hotel and have space issues, I would recommend that you request as large of a room as possible when you book. I understand room sizes are different in NYC, but it was borderline uncomfortable and claustrophobic. Had we been staying more than 1 night I would have requested a larger room.
The doormen and valets were probably the most friendly and polite individuals that I have ever met at a hotel. I was pleasantly surprised, and they were most helpful with directions and restaurant/bar suggestions, and they were not pushy for tips (though I would suggest that you do tip). The staff overall were very pleasant, especially considering that they were working during the holidays. 
Overall, the hotel was clean (a true surprise because it is an older hotel, and pet friendly), the staff was friendly, and the location couldn't be beat. Not to mention, valet parking was only $30 for 26 hours. 
Downsides: The small room, the view, the hard beds (however, bedbug free!), the scratchy sheets, and the lack of anywhere for my dog to do her business. We eventually find a pile of mulch outside of Macy's, but I wouldn't walk there alone at night.",MayHee,2010-12-01,122005,2011-01-15,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Frequent business traveler to the hotel, good value for NYC” I stay at the New Yorker frequently (1-2 weeks per month) for business. 
The positives: It is convenient location if you travel through Penn Station, as I take the Acela from Boston and it is right across the street. The rooms are clean and of a decent size, and the prices usually can't be beat for comparable room quality for NYC. They recently redid their gym on the basement floor, and it is well above average in terms of size and quality of equipment compared to most hotel gyms, with personal TVs on all the cardio equipment. My company rate means I get free continental breakfast on the 39th floor and great view of NYC from there, and everyone gets free wifi throughout the hotel which is always nice.
The negatives: The neighborhood itself is not great by NYC standards (8th ave and 34th St.) as the restaurants and bars in the area are a bit dull. I sometimes have to wait in a long line to check in, and although I have always been treated nicely, I have seen some gruff service to other people at the front desk. It is more of a tourist hotel, so lobby can be hectic and noisy. The hallways are carpeted in an awful brown rug, not that I really care, but has a drab look about it. The bathrooms are outfitted with an old style bathtub and sink, the water temperature in the shower is unpredictable, and there isn't much room to spread out your toiletries above the sink. As a business traveller, I'm big on getting points, and the hotel is part of Wyndham Rewards, which isn't great as their properties in general don't compare even close to Hilton or Marriott.",travellingconsultant,2011-01-01,122005,2011-01-14,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Hotel” We have just returned from a stay in the New Yorker and it was great. We were a bit apprehensive after reading the review about the attempted mugging/robbery but we need't have worried, we were upgraded on arrival and checked in within minutes. They are very safety oriented and you have to show your key card before you are allowed onto the elevators and this made me feel totally safe. I only have one issue with the room and that was the air conditioning and bathroom - the bathroom was freezing and had no heating, and the air conditioning / heating only heated one side of the room at first then after a while the whole room warmed up. Apart from that there was free internet which worked great, the bed was comfortable and the room had two queen beds and a great layout. As a smoker (I know that's bad!) I went outside to have a smoke and one night there was a man begging for money which several gave but that still wasn't enough for him and he was cursing etc, even after he had money and in the end someone told the hotel security and he dealt with him swiftly and we never had any problems after that. We did eat at the Tick Tock Diner and had a lovely meal however we were put off eating in there again after we had the bill and the waiter asked for a tip in excess of 30% I wouldn't have minded but even the check stated that the tip should be approx 15%. I would have paid 50% tip if the service had have been excellent but for a over-eager waiter to demand 30% put me right off, this wasn't the diner's fault and we took take-outs most evenings from here as the food was great. 
Anyway back to the hotel, this was a great hotel and would return.",Chipsntoastie,2011-01-01,122005,2011-01-14,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Location” I was in New York for the NRF show and to spend some time visiting the sights. This hotel was the perfect location in Manhattan. The room was nice and updated but there were still touches of the hotel's age. The bathroom was a below par - it was like a freezer and the shower was either screaming hot or frosty cold. Based on the room and location of this hotel I would highly recommend this to anyone. The highlights were:
Location: It is a block from Penn station if you want to take the subway around Manhattan and is close enough to walk any of the north side attractions like Central Park or Times Square.
Sleep Quality: the beds were new and pretty comfortable and made for a great sleep. The blinds close tightly so you can black out the room. 
Service: the staff was very helpful with all of our requests.",bald_giraffe,2011-01-01,122005,2011-01-14,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great Hotel!!!” I stayed here for a weekend with my two nieces. We were able to check in early, which was great! My only issue during this whole trip was with the front desk lady who helped us. I guess there was an issue in another room and while she was checking us in, was on the phone speaking with maintance. She wouldn't talk to us, she just kept pointing to where I should sign on the papers. I was trying to ask her questions but she wouldn't get off the phone or even acknowledge us. She gave us the keys and as we are walking away, she yelled ""HEY"" to get our attention, because we filled out the wrong information. But other than that, everyone else was great, the location was great, and we had a wonderful time! The room was very up to date, cozy, comfortable, and clean.

"“A delightful experience” I was a bit concerned by some reviews, but after spending five nights at the NYer, I cannot understand where the complaints are coming from. The hotel was built in 1929 in the art deco style, with an attention to architecture and details. The room had a corresponding decor. It was like a trip back in time to a more luxurious era, but with such modern touches as free unlimited Wifi and a large flat-screen TV. With 12 elevators (for 40 floors), I never had to wait more than a few seconds, and since half the elevators only stopped after the 21st floor, the trip to my room, on the 29th floor, took about a half-minute! The beds were very comfortable, the room decor was elegant yet simple in art deco style, including even the ceiling fixture and a standing lamp. The room quiet, and I slept very well. My room looked East toward the Chrysler and Empire State Bldgs, quite a view by day and even moreso at night. Since the weather was terrible, I appreciated two good (but not great) restaurants right in the hotel. The tick-Tock is a 24-hour reasonably-priced diner serving trememndous portions of both both New York (Egg Creams, NY cheese cake, reuben s/w) and Southern (red velvet cake, BBQ) specialties. They serve a full range of food from excellent omelets and pancakes to complex salads, about 8 kinds of hamburger including lamb-tsadziki, and full dinners such as steak, fish, pasta etc. The NYer also offers an upscale diner where I took my wife for our anniversary, and was not disappointed. The location is great for shopping; you can take the subway stop literally next to the hotel entrance all the way to JFK for $7.50. If you are primarily interested in Museum Mile, however, you would be better off in a hotel on the upper East Side, (but that will cost considerably more). My only complaints: I would have liked a coffee/tea-maker in the room, altho' there is a stand in the lobby offering coffee or tea for $2 @, along with excellent pastries. Also, the water in the shower tended to oscillate btn scalding and freezing. The next time I am in NY, I will definitely return. (Note that the hotel's full name is The Ramada Plaza New Yorker).",Shimke,2011-01-01,122005,2011-01-12,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“BEST WEEK OF MY LIFE!” We flew into new york the day after the blizzard for a week over new years, therefore had a massive delay on the way and a nightmare at jfk when we finally arrived at the hotel on the early hours of the 28th around 7 hours after our original check in time..Check in was smooth and quick although as a young couple we never had a credit card therefore had to leave a 300$ deposit it would have nice to have known this before but i would say this is more our travel agents fault not the hotels. I had emailed the hotel previously to request the highest floor possible with a skyline view and i can tell they did not disappoint 36 floors up with the most amazing view ive ever seen it was magical if you stood on the bed you could even see lady liberty in the distance i spent many hours just gazing out the window! The room was perfecrt for our needs comfiest bed ive ever slept in wit big plasma tv with 40 odd channels always something to watch.. bath was deep and filled up so quickly showere did occasionally fluicker between hot n cold but not a major problem.

"“Love this hotel and would stay again” We stayed at this hotel located centrally in Madison Square Garden right down the street from Macys and Times Square. It was perfect.

The lobby was decorated beautifully for Christmas with Christmas music playing all through the day/night and the security is great.

"“Fantastic! Would definitely stay again!” We stayed at the New Yorker for 5 nights in December as part of our honeymoon. We couldn't have asked for a better hotel and at a very reasonable price for New York. Some may say that the rooms are small - and compared to say rooms in Orlando, it may seem that way. However we lived in London for many years and our room at the New Yorker was far larger than many of those, including the 4 and 5 star ones. 
Room: As it was our honeymoon we had been upgraded to an Empire State Building View on the 35th floor (which also has a great view of the Chrysler Building) - and it completly took our breath away, you are so close, and at night everything is lit up - it is so beautiful. (A hint if you have a room like this, get up really early and you can get some great photo's of the Empire State Building as the sun rises). The bed was really comfortable, there is a large flat screen tv with a variety of channels, and all the other amenities you might need. The bathroom is a good size (one small note, when we were there the shower always fluctuated between hot and cold! But not a major problem). There is also free wi fi which was great.
Hotel Amenities: The lobby is very nice and the staff were really helpful. Security is good as they check your room card as you go through to the lifts. There is a fantastic bar that is part of the hotel called Cooper's Tavern (they had the best cosmopolitian I have ever had!), they also do food and the snacks and meal we had there were great (check their wine prices first though before you order as they are quite pricy.) There is also the tick tock diner, we didn't have breakfast but we ate dinner there the first night, it was okay but for the price we could have had much better.
Location: I would have given the hotel 5 stars simply for this! There is a Starbucks right across from the hotel (morning life saver!), a 24 hour pharmacy across the road which sells food, drink and loads of other stuff - it was really useful. 5th Avenue is 3 blocks away so you could easily walk to the Empire State Building. In fact the whole point about how great the hotel was, was that most things were within walking distance! We walked to Macy's, Grand Central, Times Square, Rockafella (be sure to do Top of the Rock as the view equals the Empire State's and you can get fantastic photo's of Central Park and the Empire State Building) and Central Park, Bloomingdales etc are also walkable if you are used to doing a lot of walking (or want to get fit!) Even if you have to use the subway, Penn Station is right down from the hotel and goes most places - just make sure you know which line you need as each entrance serves a different line and you can't get from one to the other! As the hotel is close to so many nearby attractions it is also quite safe to walk around at night. As I said, we lived in London so we are used to a big city at night, but I really did feel safe the whole time and was quite happy walking at night.
We can't wait to return to New York and we will definitely be staying at the New Yorker again, I wouldn't even look at anything else.
As a side note, a few places we ate at that were really good: We went on the Bateaux Dinner Cruise (will review it later) and that was amazing. Red Bamboo Vegetarian restaurant near Washington Square - absolutely fantastic and as a vegetarian, the best meal we had ever had (and the cheapest!).

"“45 minutes in check-in queue, best wishes to manager on duty” Hi,
This hotel has severe issues with the quality of their service. First of all, we had to wait 45 minutes to be able to check in. And there many others behind us who probably waited over an hour. Two polite ladies in reception tried to manage all visitors without any help. 
I tried to ask help from the gentlemen in the information desk (who had nothing to do) but nothing happened. Finally I requested to speak to Manager on duty. Information desk guy asked where I will be. Well, I am standing in that long queue in front of you, dear sir!
Manager on duty never showed his/her face or called. This tells a lot about how this hotel treats its Customers (rooms are not that cheap).

"“Another Great Stay At The New Yorker” We spent Christmas and New Year at The New Yorker from 23rd December to the 2nd Jan and this was our 3rd stay at the hotel.
It was an absolute pleasure once again. We had emailed the hotel before our arrival as it was our Son's 8th birthday the day we arrived and the hotel arranged for some balloons to be put in the room.
We were given an upgraded room on the 23rd floor at the front of the hotel with a great view of the Empire State Building and the room was a good size, clean and comfortable.
All of the staff at the hotel from Check in to Security were absolutely fantastic and made us very welcome throughout our stay.
We ate and drank in Coopers Tavern, and it was quite cool to sit in their and drink whilst watching the blizzard outside!
Breakfast nearly every day in the Tick Tock Diner and again we couldn't fault it, great food, excellent staff.
I don't think we could fault the hotel at all, everything from the staff to the rooms to the complimentary wifi were spot on.
I think the only negative comment I would make is about fellow guests who seem to think it's perfectly acceptable to have loud conversations in the lift area and corridors outside the rooms in the early hours of the morning!

Staff courteous and helpful. We were on a limited budget, so it was nice to have a McDonald's right across the street for our morning coffee. Our retturn flight left out of Newark, so we took the train out of Penn Station which is literally a block away. Only problem we had was that our shower would somtimes go from scalding hot to ice cold. Room small but very comfortable and clean. Walking distance to all the major sites- the only time we took a taxi was to Radio City for the Christmas show and we were somewhat dressed up and we were in NYC right after the big blizzard.

"“Great location. Shame about room security” Stayed in the New Yorker between dates 12th - 17th December 2010. Booked a Queen metro room and was allocated a room on 23rd floor. The rooms are really small but adequate and clean. The bed seemed really tiny not sure if it was really a queen size more like a double. Could hear a little traffic noise but was fully expecting this as in New York it wasn't load enough to disturb our sleep after long days sight seeing
The reception is nice enough and receptionist staff on arrival were really helpful and checked us in really quickly. Lots of lifts to the rooms didn't have to wait long at all.
Concierge was busy at all times it seemed and you had to wait in a very long line to be seen. We gave up after a 20 min wait & 3 people still to be seen in front of us!!
Hotel located in a very central spot. Really close to Macy's & Empire State Building and a short walk to Time Square. I would rate location excellent. 
In general we were really happy with our stay at the New Yorker until our very last day of holiday when we noticed a very expensive bottle of perfume had been taken from our room. (all our other valuables were locked in a security box thank goodness) This was reported to the Manager of the hotel and securtiy who promised to investigate the matter.

"“Stayed in Sept 2009 actually - cosy rooms! by cosy i mean tiny!” This hotel was actually very nice, I have stayed in NYC once before at the Belvedere and what one hotel lacks, the other gains.
New Yorker was very close to Macys, opposite madison square gardens, and had a fantastic view of Empire State Building. It was also a stones throw from the Bus terminal (which was actually a negative...but about that later)
It was a shotr walk to Times Sq and Broadway, and my advice would be where sensible walking shoes if you wish to visit here by foot, and even more so if you plan to walk to madison ave, fifth ave and central aprl - which are all must see's!
We walked everywhere in Midtown, but it is advisable to get a subway pass or even better but more costly, a hop on/off open tour bus pass, as they stop all over and go to financial district, brookyln, all over midtown, harlem and all the points of interest you will ever need!
Right about the Hotel, 
The hotel (we think?!?) from Dunster Checks in...
The lobby is lovely and they have kept it contemporary whilst being sympathetic to its original era (I think its the 1920's)
Anyway, its been done up lovely, but the rooms are soooo pokey! Well ours was anyway! No room for a safe, a teeny wardrobe, small bathroom (but adequate) and just enough walking space around the bed - no vanity area - the TV on the wall and just a small side table to fit an ice bucket on - no coffee facilities!
The staff were wonderful and they even dropped us at back to Newark airport for a lot less than taxis and not much more than the buses - we booked it only about half hour before needing to leave as planned to get the bus.
There is a fantastic diner attached to the hotel - which I recommend for breakfast visit even if you dont stop in this hotel! It was very reasonably priced, always got a table (always a small queue but went down very quickly) and table service is quick without feeling rushed, and coffee is served constantly.
There was also a bar attached which was a plus with this hotel as the Belvedere didnt have this and they always had a happy hour (if i remember rightly from 5-6ish) and was perfect when we pulled up from a hectic day in the city! It serves meals which we didnt try but the bar snacks were nice - which we used when we had to rush off to a show! Cocktails (and drinks) were pricey but the locality was definitly a plus point!
Now regarding that bus stop problem! Great for getting the bus to the airport - and all over USA by the sounds of it...becasue of this there is every kind of shop you need close by - chemists, electricals, McDonalds, Starbucks, Adult vids (didnt enter but cant not notice them ;D ) The negative is that its the biggest bus station either in the US or the world maybe?!?! - it caters for many undesirables! There are tramps / homeless people galore! The police go past constantly. we actually counted 25 police going past at one point - but could have been a drill! Beggars are everywhere and people asking you to buy there CD's, crap theyve made etc! You'd think you were in a flea market! and everywhere smells of urine! honestly, avoid this area! lol
Other than that a fab stay here! I preferred the Belvedere, but the facilities here were better...again regarsdsw to locality - I preferred Belvedere as we were right next to Hells Kitchen and Times sq - which I loved all the restaurants and was able to eat there every night - at a much less and much tastier than typical NY eateries.
I have visited NY in Nov 2007 which was lovely to see Rockerfella Xmas tree and decs but preferred the visit at end of Sept 2009 as the weather was lovely - like a hot UK summers day everyday - no rain, no cold and lovely wakls with ice cream around central park! - Although the heat made the bins stink!

Try Tick Tock Diner for breakfast and you won't manage lunch. CoopersTavern is first class - service and food really good. Busy but you don't feel you have to rush. Diners are made to feel that you are the only people there.

"“Never, ever stay here” Wow. What a dump. 
I stayed here in the winter and was excited about staying at such a landmark place. Upon arrival, it took us 2 hours to get checked in. yes. 2 hours.
I got to my room and turned the light on and got a huge electric shock - it actually made sparks fly! I coudl see daylight between the aircon/heater and the outside - it was a window unit type. So, needless to say, it was very cold and drafty.
The springs on the bed also gave me electric shocks every time I rolled over in bed and I wasn't able to sleep well. I think this was because of the static bedsread (very synthetic) and the awful carpet.
No hairdryer.
I cried on my first night in this hotel and would never, ever return.

"“Perfect.” We had a fantastic stay at the New Yorker. It really is perfectly located to explore most of the 'sights' by foot - we had our 7 year old with us and he was able to walk around to the places of interest easily.
I had emailed ahead and asked for a room with a view and we weren't disappointed. A lovely view over the Hudson, a large room with 2 very comfortable queen beds and 2 large storage cupboards, plenty of drawer space and a large TV. Yes, the bathroom is small, but all I do is shower, wash and use the toilet none of which require masses of space.
Every member of staff we encountered was polite and friendly. My son was worried that Santa wouldn't know where to find him so on Christmas Eve he wrote a little note which we passed to a member of staff who made a big deal out of promising to pass it on. 
The room was immaculately tidy, the housekeeping staff did a fabulous job and didn't grumble at the amount of rubbish accrued by a 7 year old's toy packaging (yes, there was LOTS!). My poor hubby was sick one day and we had to request for housekeeping to re clean the bathroom (obviously we cleaned it up but had no bleach etc!) which they did without complaint.

"“Brilliant hotel, shame about the receptionist!” Everything about this hotel is good except for the attitude of one of the female receptionists. We chose this hotel as I was travelling with my two teenage children and the travel agent had confirmed that this was one of the very few hotels in Manhattan that offer rooms with 3 beds and the booking confirmation said ""room must have 3 beds"". On arrival (delayed due to snow) the room we were given had 2 double beds but we were tired and hungry so left cases and went to find food. When we returned my daughter went to bed and I began to unpack but found water running down into the wardrobe so I went to reception and was told we could change rooms which I asked to do the next morning. I also explained that the booking was for a room with 3 beds and the male receptionist said that I should return to reception the next morning which I did which is when I encountered a female receptionist with a bad attitude problem. I explained about the leaking water and she started tapping away on the computer I also started to explain about the beds but she just held up her hand and told me to wait. She sorted out a change of room after conferring with her manager but said that for a put-u-up bed to be put in the room we would have to be charged. I asked to speak to the manager who she reluctantly went to get. The duty manager was friendly and explained that we had been upgraded to a bigger room (without running water in the wardrobe) but would be charged if we wanted a camp bed. We viewed the new room and decided we could manage but after contacting our travel agent a bed was provided without additional charge.
Apart from the surly attitude of the receptionist this hotel is perfect for a visit to Manhattan. All the other staff were friendly and helpful. Both our rooms (the first on the 31st floor and the upgrade on the 37th) had views of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. It was close to Macy's and Madison Square Garden and close to to the Subway.

"“Clean Rooms, Great Location & Great Customer Service” If I am staying in NYC, I will be staying at the New Yorker Hotel. This is the second time that I stayed at the New Yorker. The rooms are very clean, which I love. The rooms and beds are small but comfortable. 
When we arrived, we were asked if we would like to upgrade to a suite. The employee even gave us the opportunity to look at the suite before we actually switched rooms. 
Once we checked into the suite, the employee called to make sure we wanted to stay and that the room was to our liking. The suite had one bed and a sofa bed. I ended up with the sofa bed. I called housekeeping to fix up the sofa bed, and I slept like a baby. :-)
Overall, the customer service is professional and very accommodating. 
I also loved that the hotel is centrally located. It is close to the bus arrivals and departures, the subway, shopping, MSG and Times Square. The main attractions are in walking distance. I also liked the Tic Toc restaurant right next door. They serve a hearty and tasty breakfast.

"“NYC Pre-Christmas with Teenage Boys” We had a perfect experience at the hotel. They helped with transportation from airport to hotel. When we arrived, everything that was advertised was exactly as said. I was pleasantly surprised by the large lobby with lots of couches and areas to relax, hang out. Two restaurants attached. We went to both, great restaurants and good service and value. We stayed on the 37th floor with a view of The Empire State Building, very cool! Very NY for tourists like us! The beds were very high off the ground which made it nice. Very clean room, the bathroom size did not bother us. 2 teenage boys not spending much time in the bathroom. A big closet to hang winter coats and lots or dresser space to unload winter clothes. I liked the history and architectural details of this hotel. I traveled with two sons - 13 and 15 years old. They loved the location. They loved being able to have freedom to explore the hotel via elevator and the blocks surrounding, expecially B & H appliances where they found their Christmas gifts. We ate at Uncle Jack's Steak House, excellent food - around the corner from the hotel after visiting The Wax Museum which was a highlight for the boys along with Times Square (a close walk) which was their favorite NY spot. We had a great visit with Big Apple Greeters who showed us The Dakota, Central Park scenes like Wollman's Rink and a stop at The Boathouse for Hot Chocolate.

(2), 24 hour 'Tick Tock' Diner on the ground floor.
(3), Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel.
Bad points
(1), Our initial room was very small and had a view of a brick wall 5 metres opposite our window. However we asked for an upgrade and room 3322 was twice the size and had a great view of the Empire State Building!
(2), Outdated bathrooms even though the hotel supposedly had a refurb. in 2008.

"“NY middle category hotels – just stop searching and try to enjoy what you get” I guess I’ll just have to give up trying to find a hotel in NY which would not be above 300 euros and have at least modern bathroom and a little bit of style.
I have nothing bad to say about New Yorker in comparison with other hotels I’ve stayed in the city. The staff was friendly, the room was clean (no bed bugs – which was a great relief since I have no idea what they look like)), the location was not far from 5th avenue and all the major staff.
However like in every hotel in this price category – the room was tiny, the bathroom was very old and it was freezing in there unless you make a hot water run in the shower for several minutes, the air conditioning was very noisy. 
On the plus side – free wifi in the room.
Unlike in Europe where for 300 euros you can stay in a really lovely family run hotel with a big room and a nice view, for the same price in NY all you can get is a tiny room in a huge building with no soul and outdated bathroom. So either go stay in one of the fancy hotels for big money, or stop searching for European comfort – that’s what I’ve decided for myself.

"“Clean, comfortable, perfect location for sightseeing, amazing service!” My boyfriend and I go to New York for a weekend in December every year to see the Christmas sights and meet up with college friends. This year we tried the New Yorker because of a sale they were having and got a pretty good deal (in comparison to other NY hotels). We usually take the bolt bus which drops you off right at the hotel if you're coming from Boston. Check in was a bit slow but the staff was pleasant. We got a room on the 31st floor with a great view (not that we had requested one so it was nice). I am crazy about checking hotel rooms for bed bugs and our room was exceptionally clean. The beds were very comfortable, there was a nice big TV, a large closet and the cleaning staff was wonderful. Yes, the rooms are small but more than enough space to sleep and shower and rest when you need to. Seriously, if you are coming to new york as a tourist and you're spending most of it in your hotel room why even go? The location is great. There are lots of sights within walking distance and the subway is just a short walk away. Cooper's Tavern is fantastic and the Tick Tock Diner is perfect for a quick breakfast to start the day (or for grabbing food at 4 am after a night out!). What I was especially pleased with is that after leaving my phone on the bed in our room, the housekeeping staff quickly retrieved it and Judy, the housekeeping adminstrator clerk, kept it safe and had it in the mail to me ASAP. She was so kind and really went out of her way to help me. Overall I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the NYC area.

"“Convenient hotel” First impressions of this hotel are very good as the public areas are quite grand. Our room was (as expected) less grand, but functional, clean and comfortable. The bed was excellent and we slept well every night. The bathroom was small and the shower a little temperamental, but my only real complaint would be that the towels are so small!
The Tick Tock diner is convenient for breakfast but gets manically busy after about 8.30am. The result of this seems to be that staff rush around and attention to detail is lost - two mornings running they got my order wrong, and weren't particularly pleasant when asked to put it right. This is not the way to ensure that they receive their blatantly requested 15% tip!
The hotel's location is good and we found it no trouble to walk to Macy's, Times Square, Radio City, and the Rockefeller Center. I would recommend going to the Top of the Rock as the views are stupendous. We went at sunset and it was stunning, although so cold we could only bear to be outside for a few minutes!
I felt safe at all times in New York and was dismayed to read the review from the lady who was mugged. We saw nothing like that and felt quite comfortable on the streets, although I did prefer to walk up and down 7th Avenue rather than 8th.

"“New Yorker Hotel Dec 2010” We booked this hotel through priceline, knowing that this was the one we were aiming for. We got a great deal and had e-mailed the hotel advising it was a special occasion and received an upgrade and breakfast coupons on checking in.
Room was on the 36th floor. Dated yet clean bathroom, bathtub and shower was good, water always hot. One thing to bear in mind is the tap doesn't seem to hold the water properly so if you like a long soak you need to have a tap lightly running throughout. This may just have been our room though. The other minor inconvenience in the bathroom is the tiny towels. The towels are hand towel size and as a
fan big fluffy towels I was a little disappointed. The bedroom is small, literally just enough room to walk around the bed. This was fine for our needs however. The bed is not huge but extremely comfy and clean. Also in the room is a TV with a decent variety of channels, a desk and an amazing view outside. From corner room we had dual views of the Hudson river and Empire State building. The skyline was gorgeous and although the windows don't open, I couldn't of wished for a better view. It is worth noting the rooms on 38th and above (I think) have balconies which would be great in warmer weather.
The staff we encountered were pleasant. The receptionist on checking in (rayvonne I think) was so friendly, and a credit to the hotel. The rest of the staff were ok, the receptionist on checking out was very rude however, and didn't look at you when speaking and just sounded fed up. The housekeeping staff were all very loud and I often awoke to them chatting away in the halls. This was a little annoying especially when it was very early and your sleeping sign is on the door. The housekeeping is very sporadic, one day it was in the morning, the next late afternoon, then morning again and finally not at all. They literally just make the bed and change the towels. They did not clear away any rubbish and this was inconvenient.
We ate a bit in the tick tock diner attached to the hotel which is great. The service is friendly, quick, and the prices great. I would recommend the milkshakes.
The location is great for a first time tourist. The subway is a block away, and fashion avenue is around the corner, meaning Macy's and lots of other stores are steps away. Times Sq is only a ten minute walk meaning theatres, resturants and more shops are nearby. On reflection I would move out of such a busy area however if you are looking for a safe central location this is perfect.

"“NOT A SAFE AREA - ATTEMPTED STREET ROBBERY OUTSIDE IT !” Sorry to go against everything that has been said here about great location (I based our choice of hotel on the great reviews and was very happy with our choice) but my husband and I were violently assaulted in a failed street robbery on our 1st night there, 10 seconds approx after stepping out the hotel door for the very first time and crossing the road, right outside Hippo shoes. A black guy did a real judas blind side slam into my husbands chest with both hands full strength obviously in an attempt to knock him off balance and make him fall over. Another heavier man was standing behind my husband and was likely going to hold him down while the other did his pockets and then into the subway and away.
It didnt work though, as my husband slammed into me who had been walking hand in hand beside him. I think I took most of the impact and fell against the newspaper stand and so in a split second , my hubby had recovered and was staring through this guy. He can look very scary when someone lays hands on him. I was totally dazed and didnt know if hed been stabbed, punched or what had just happened. We are a healthy fit couple in our 40s and not what you would imagine would be a good choice for a mugging.
When my hubbie realised there was two of them, he took the smartest option and gathered me up and we walked out of the situation. Twenty yards up the street were two cops in a van and we told them the story. One says ""Im sorry sir, this ain't unusual round here...welcome to New York "" and shook our hands.
 I know this isn't the hotels fault but I would not advise anybody to stay in this area. Its rundown, got a derelict right opposite and a 24 hr McDonalds (never good in any city) opposite the hotel which attracts all the undesirables. I really did not feel safe. Theres cop cars sitting at the end of each block and theres obviously a reason for that. The next day on our way back from shopping about 5.30pm, streets thronging with people and a homeless man/drug addict was relieving himself against the glass window of Subway on the next block ! ....nice ! This incident totally ruined our trip for me, I couldn't relax on the side streets at all. On a positive...yes I know ...there were some... we spent more time in the hotel bar and Coopers Tavern than we had intended. The food was excellent and the service very good too. The bar staff were friendly and professional, particularly the bar manager who was probably the most pleasant person we met in New York, so a big thanks to him. The bed was comfy and the tick tock diner was tasty, fast and efficient. 
Its very hard to recover a holiday from something like this even though they got away with nothing but I have no desire to come back to NYC ! So apologies if people think Im being a grouch, Im not, Im just wanting everyone to be aware of what happened us as I dread to think what would happen an older couple.The force he hit us with , they would have hit the ground so hard they'd have broken bones and lost their belongings.",finnsaunders,2010-12-01,122005,2010-12-15,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Nice hotel, Excellent Location - Loved Coopers Tavern!!!” Just returned from a Christmas shopping 4 night break with my hubby and we really liked this hotel. On arrival the reception is quite impressive, very spacious and lovely decor. We checked in with no problems and when I requested a room with a decent view the chap tried his best to accomodate us. 
We were given a room on the 35th floor with a view over looking Madison Square Gardens. The room was extremley small but to be honest I think this is the same in most New York hotels. Not a lot of storage space either but as we were only there for 4 nights this was not a problem. Room was very clean and maintained every day. 
We ate in both the Tick Tock Diner and also in Coopers bar which were located within the hotel. We both loved our meal in Coopers bar and would definetely return and recommend to others.
Overall the hotel is good for a short break and is in an ideal location, close to Times Square. There is a subway station within minutes as well to reach all other attractions.

"“Perfect spot to explore the Big Apple” We arrived on Columbus weekend so it was a little hectic, but staff were friendly and helpful. We booked a wheelchair accessible room (full roll-in shower) and the room was perfect for my partner's needs. The bed was a small queen so I ended up sleeping on a pull-out. The hotel and room were decorated in beautiful art deco style, our room was a spacious corner room with views of the Chrysler building. The negatives to staying here were that it took at least half an hour for staff to arrive if you requested anything (blankets etc) and front desk staff were not so friendly (all other staff were great). A real disappointment for disabled travelers is that the Tick Tock Diner is not wheelchair accessible! It is only a couple of steps and a ramp could easily be accommodated from the hotel lobby entrance. Positives are that it was good value for money, we found the location to be central and all attractions easily accessed, room and hotel decor is lovely and generally ver friendly staff.

"“Can't fault it” We arrived at the New Yorker Hotel on Black Friday - the busiest shopping day of the year - and given it's location one block from Macy's, the area was understandably hectic! The lobby was calm and organised however and we checked in quickly and efficiently. The room was certainly adequate - above average for the price we paid - clean, comfortable and with a view, albeit a semi obstructed one, over South Manhattan. The staff were non-intrusive but helpful when required - we lost a credit card on the last day of our trip and they allowed us to use a phone on reception to avoid high mobile costs!
Location wise it's close to the subway and Penn Station, a short walk from Times Sq. and the diner next door does a decent breakfast, although I would strongly recommend venturing away from the midtown area for a more interesting dining experience!
Overall I can't fault it, and if you like being in the tourist hub of a big city then this is certainly one of your best options.",crazyrain,2010-12-01,122005,2010-12-10,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Superb Stay, Fantastic Hotel, Very Happy with the New Yorker Hotel” My fiancee took me to New York for my 30th Birthday and we booked flights and hotel online - something where there is always an element of doubt in the back of your mind regarding the hotel you have booked. We picked the New Yorker due to comments on here and i have to say, how impressed we both were with everything about this amazing hotel.
It is a huge building and upon entering you are greeted with a large pretty foyer area. The staff are prompt and friendly. The lifts are quick. The rooms are large - as we were worried about having a small rooms due to some reviews on other hotels and there is a great ambience all around the hotel.
What is great about this hotel is the location....... 5 - 10 mins walk will take you to Times Square in one direction and 5-10 mins walk in the other will take you to Maceys and the Empire State Building on 34 Street. If you need to use the Subway, which i would definately recommend to get to (South Ferry/Wall Street/9/11 Memorial or Central Park) it is right outside the hotel doors and easy to navigate your way round - easier than London Underground and the staff here are much more firendly, approachable, polite!!!
There is a superb diner attached to the Hote - thel Tick Tock Diner, which is open 24hrs and serves some of the best food we tasted in New York. The other side of the hotels foyer is a bar which is tasteful. The bell boys are helpful with both bags and arranging taxis and the cleansiness of the hotel is great.
We were sad to leave but have returned with a huge smile on our faces, largely due to the New Yorker Hotel.
I would not hesitate to recommend this Hotel to anyone who is weighing up options with Hotels in New York.",planky1911,2010-12-01,122005,2010-12-04,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location, nice room” The New Yorker was in a great location. Walking distance to Times Sq, Broadway etc.
Rooms were decent size although the wardrobe was tiny! Nice flat screen LCD. We did originally get put into a twin room rather than double on level 23 with no view but reception were happy to move us to a double on the 35th with a view of the Hudson.
Tik Tok diner next door is decent but bit expensive and gets busy.
You can use the business center downstairs to check-in and print off boarding cards for free.

"“Not disappointed by The New Yorker - art deco delight” This hotel deserves all the good comments that have been posted. Our room had the most comfy bed and pillows of any hotel I have stayed in, and I have been travelling and staying in hotels around the world since 1969. Our room was large, clean and tastefully decorated, keeping the 1920's theme. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, particularly the lady at the concierge desk and the guys on the transportation desk, one of whom is the best looking male I have ever seen, (Colin Farrell eat your heart out!). If there was any criticism it would be the charge for storing your bags, every hotel I have stayed at provided this service free of charge, and it was annoying having to go to reception to get access to the safety deposit box rather than having a safe in the room and the bathroom was rather small. On the plus side, despite being on the 19th floor, we never had to wait for a lift, the Tick Tock diner was good value and the hotel was immaculately clean. Macy's is a short walk, the subway is next to the Hotel and the bus terminal an 8 minute walk away. Would recommend a trip to Woodbury Common Outlet Village and a cocktail in the Carnegie Club.",cawHG,2010-11-01,122005,2010-12-03,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Value / Excellent Location” We (Myself, Wife & 2 friends) checked in on Nov 26th and were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Given the relatively small amount of money it cost we were expecting something quite shabby and prepared ourselves for the worst with the usual justification of ""It's only somewhere to sleep, it doesn't really matter if it's a dump!!""
What we were greeted with was friendly reception staff, a clean room and a perfect location! Our worries couldn't of been further from the truth.
Macy's and the Empire State Building are only a couple of blocks away (about 5 mins walk), Central Park is just 3 tube stops away and Times Square and Broadway are about 15 mins walk away. It cost us about $12 in a yellow cab to get to Battery Park for our trip to the Statue Of Liberty and we visited Ground Zero while we were in that area of Manhattan.
Our room was a bit on the small side but this wasn't a problem and there was easily enough storage space for our 5 days. The room was cleaned each day and clean towels were left.
My only (slight) complaint would be that it got quite noisy outside our room (on the 22nd floor) around 6am each morning. However, due to jetlag we were usually awake around this time anyway!!
We had breakfast each day in the Tick Tock Diner. The food was good but we had to wait for a table if we arrived later than 8am. On our last day we ate at Coopers Tavern which is also part of the hotel. This was superb and we all wished we'd discovered this little gem sooner!!
In summary, great value for money and an excellent location. I'd have no hesitation recommending this hotel.",Bluey_VIII,2010-11-01,122005,2010-12-02,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Friendly and Convenient” We were pleasantly surprised at the friendliness of the staff and the amazing view from our room. We stayed in a New Yorker Suite. While a bit dated, the room and furnishings were clean and comfortable. The room itself was basic and no-frills. The bedding was cozy and bug-free. The other reviews did not speak highly of the bathroom. I won't challenge that. The tile was painted for some reason, and it was chipped. However, it was clean and adequate. 
The two things that stand out about this hotel by far are the fantastic location and the helpful staff. We usually stay at smaller boutique hotels while in NYC but decided to give the New Yorker a try. We couldn't be more pleased with the choice. It was less expensive and more convenient. Every staff member that we encountered from the front desk to cleaning staff and maintenance workers were polite and helpful. 
The only incident with staff that was a bit off-putting concerned the Tic-toc diner, but I'm not sure if the hotel has much to do with that.",greenturtle53,2010-11-01,122005,2010-12-01,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The very large, clean room had a spectacular view of the Empire State Building - and the ending point for the parade. All other staff were very friendly, the location was exceptional.

"“Perfect trip, Perfect location, Perfect hotel :)” Stayed here December 2009 for 5 days, having stayed there previously had really high expectations and The NewYorker lived up to everything we had imagined . . . Our room had a beautiful view of the Hudson River which we had requested. The room itself was nicely decorated and the bed was really comfy :) which was perfect after a long day shopping!
The trip to Woodbury Commons is a must do! Its filled with great bargains but remember if you love to shop bring an empty suitcase so you can fill it with all your purchases and dont have to buy an overpriced one there like I did!! For the best views of the city go to Top of the Rock (Rockefeller Center), views are brilliant and unrestricted from every angle absolutely FANTASTIC!!!
The hotel is located right in the middle of everything across the road from Madison Square Gardens, a block away from Macys and literally a 5 min stroll to the shops on Fifth Avenue. 
The Tick Tock Diner located within the hotel is great for a full breakfast and snacks throughout the day. The staff are really nice and friendly and work really hard as it does be quite busy! It is also really cheap and the food is good with a great selection for even the fussiest of eaters!
The staff in the hotel are really nice and courteous and the cleaners do a great job in the rooms! The only flaw I would have with this hotel is with the Safety Deposit Boxes . . They are located behind the front desk but you have to queue behind all the check in/check out guests which can be very frustrating at busy times of the day. . I think they should either have a staff member designated for this area with a seperate queue or put safes in the rooms!

Staff were pleasant and we had the unusual US experience of a refused tip from a housekeeping person who went out of his way to get us some ice.

"“Wonderful” We stayed at the New Yorker for 4 nights in November. I had emailed/ twittered/ facebooked to see if we could get an upgrade to a room with a view but had not heard back from anyone. I was pleasantly surprised when we went up to our room (34th Floor) because out one window we could see the Hudson River and the Chrysler Bldg and out the other window was the Empire State Bldg. Very nice. Our room also had a little balcony flat out the window - so cute! When we got to the room we put our luggage in the bathtub and searched for bed bugs - none were found:) The room was nice and cleaned very well each day (and we did not leave a tip until check out). Upon request Housekeeping will bring up a room coffee maker, etc. The location is PERFECT - close to Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, Macy's, etc. It was GREAT! The only negative was that the information desk suggested a shuttle car back to the airport - what a waste. The hotel did the booking and notified us that the car was out front. So we got to the airport and it turned out that our car was for someone else and our prepayment slip would not pay this driver. We didn't end up having to pay this driver but I'm pretty sure he didn't get paid from his company for that trip. JUST FLAG DOWN A YELLOW TAXI! Less hassle. Lots of good restaurants near by - Stage Door Deli, Tic Toc, etc. Walk to Grand Central Station - lots of good, cheap food choices. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.

"“Good until last minute....” The New Yorker is a hotel with a chequered history, and it shows. The hotel itself was refurbished a few years ago and although the rooms are small, they are neat and clean with decent ensuites, multichannel flat screen TVs and decent beds and bedding. The area is good, with Macy's only a few minutes walk, along with the Empire State Building and Pennsylvania Station. The Tick Tock diner in the hotel is 24hrs and is good for an American (i.e. enormous) breakfast, reasonably priced.
However the staff leave much to be desired. I did not know that one must leave money on the bed to ensure that the room is cleaned (tipping cleaning staff is unheard of at home) and the first day my room was left untouched. I was told about tipping and so the next day I put two dollars on the bed...lo and behold, cleaning was performed. We were overcharged for a shuttle to the airport....we were overcharged for luggage facilities....we were overcharged for everything. The 'Information' desk directed us to two separate shops which didn't exist any more, and recommended a Chinese restaurant which made us all sick. To cap it all, the next day was checkout after a four day stay, and being miserably ill I rang first thing and asked for late checkout (only an extra three hours, as I was leaving for the airport). This was refused by the Reception in the most aggressive manner I have ever encountered in a large hotel, and only ten minutes later a bill was shoved under the door of the room for ""extra charges"".

"“THANKYOU SO MUCH......” On arrival i was upgraded to an Empire State Building view outside my bedroom window, on the 29th floor, courtesy of Samira on the front desk, who was so helpful throughout my entire stay at the New Yorker Hotel. A Big thankyou Samira.
Id promised my son on his 13th Birthday id take him to visit New York and selected The New Yorker after doing lenghty searches on Hotels within easy walking distance to all attractions, and the New Yorker Hotel lived up to that.
Id read good and bad reviews, the bad were ""Bed Bugs"" Dirty rooms, Unfriendly Staff, Tiny rooms, etc etc.... we experienced none of the mentioned. Our room was clean, linen changed daily, room spacious, and no evidence of ""Bed Bugs"", and believe me i checked.
We were able to leave our bags at the Hotel after checkout for collection later, we were even given a key card so as we could use the toilet facilities after checkout. Now thats what i call service.
Tick Tock adjacent we ate in everyday, food was Great, with huge portions and wonderful hard working staff.
We have only been back in England a few hours and i felt i had to write a review straight away, if you want value for money, friendly helpful staff look no further, and nope im not on commission, just had a wonderful stay, and most important of all my son will never forget his 13th Birthday.

"“Interesting Hotel” Stayed for four nights at the New Yorker for a conference. Room and bathroom was small by US standards. Fabulous bed, really good sleep quality. I had a problem with the TV remote control, which was speedily sorted.
Took breakfast each day plus few dinners in the Tick Tock Diner. I quite liked it, though the vouchers for continental breakast would barely be sufficient for a five year old.

"“The Best” This is the third time we have stayed in the New Yorker and each time it gets better. Great location with subway, boltbus just outside and short walk to Times Square. New York is such a great city and staying at this hotel is the icing on the cake. All the staff are extremely helpful and the service is great in all areas. Love the Art Deco! The rooms were immaculate and the room attendants were effecient and lovely people. We will always stay there when we are fortunate enough to visit New York and would certainly recommend it to friends - in fact we already have. Yes- the air conditioning is a little noisy and I find the pillows a little uncomfortable, but thats a personal thing as I like feather pillows. Anyway, neither of these things would stop me staying again. The Tick Tock Diner adjacent serves excellent food with fantastic service. All in all a wonderful stay.",Berger49,2010-10-01,122005,2010-11-17,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Location, decent rooms, a good choice for NYC” I booked this hotel through Priceline and got an excellent rate. All in all, I was very pleased with the stay and I would definitely stay again.
The room we had was tiny. It had one queen bed in it and a desk off in one corner and a closet on one wall. There was a flat panel TV on the wall, and the bed had a padded headboard on the wall behind it. Getting around to the far side of the bed was a bit difficult due to the desk. I had to squeeze between the two. 
The bathroom was also tiny, and the paint on the walls was peeling a bit. However, it looked like they had done some renovations recently, and everything was new and clean. The toilet was hard up against one wall, though, so that made things a bit interesting.
The bed was very comfortable and the linens looked clean and nice. We were on the 20th floor, and had a great view of the Hudson river and NJ. I also liked the fact that there was central A/C and heat, instead of the usual noisy window unit.
The common areas, including the lobby, are a spectacle of New York's Art Deco glory and very impressive. The location is about as good as it gets. Literally across the street from Penn Station, for those arriving on Amtrak. There is a subway station next to the hotel that will get you anywhere you want to go. Times Sq. and the Broadway theaters are a short walk away, as are the fantastic International restaurants on 9th Avenue.
The hotel has a diner in the lobby, the Tick Tock Diner, which was very good, but definitely on the expensive side for a diner. If money is an issue, you can get a good, cheap and filling breakfast at the Gray's Papaya down the street, or at any number of take out places along 8th Avenue.
Overall, a good stay and I will certainly be looking to snag this one again on Priceline when I go back to New York.",BeantownMan,2010-11-01,122005,2010-11-16,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The Blueberry pancakes were the best I had ever had!! There is a Starbucks across the street. The room was small but the beds very very comfortable and especially the pillows. Our room was cleaned perfectly everyday and no bed bugs. The old time feel is definitely there. Bathroom is exactly how pictured and small but very clean and served its purpose.

"“You paying for the location” Im a little late writing this review but I stayed at the New Yorker in January 2009 and paid around £500 for 4 nights in a standard room. First impressions of the hotel were very good; the lobby is very nice and big with nice check in staff providing good customer service. Our room was very small and had an awful view of another building. The bathroom was very dated and could have done with a new coat of paint. You do not come to New York to sit in your room, so I was happy about the location of the hotel. It is centrally located and is only a short cab ride away from all the major attractions. There was security before you entered the lifts which I thought was excellent as it made you feel safe and didn’t allow non residents to enter the hotel. 
If you visit New York, you must visit Woodbury Common which is an outlet shopping area; this is excellent if you want to do some serious shopping. (Buses go from the central bus station) I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone travelling to New York",Treena33,2009-12-01,122005,2010-11-15,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“There are much nicer hotels for less money nearby.” We booked a standard room through the hotel's website for 5 nights. The confirmation said ""slightly larger room"". Our room was tiny, barely big enough for a queen bed, and looked nothing like the picture of a standard room. The bathroom was not big enough for two people to stand in. The shower leaked, and after letting the water run for 10 minutes, was barely hot enough for a shower. The bath products looked like something purchased at the dollar store. No ESPN on the tv, and the bed was hard with scratchy sheets. For this we paid $300/night.

"“Good hotel, great location and great price” I stayed at the New Yorker for 5 days in October 2010 and was impressed by the hotel and its staff.
It’s well located at 8th and 34th, directly opposite Madison Square Garden and minutes from Penn Station; a few blocks further you have Times Square and the Empire State Building.
The New Yorker was much cheaper than most of its rivals, we paid £150 per night for a ‘Metro renovated queen’ room via hotels.com when most nearby hotels with similar trip Advisor ratings were £50 - £100 per night more.
It’s a beautiful building, reminiscent of a bygone age. The room wasn’t huge but more than adequate. The bathroom was a little dated and the the hallways could do with a bit of a refurb but I found it all very charming and everything was very clean.
Two small things that please me: unlike many hotels the hairdryer in the bathroom was actually very good (one less thing to pack) and the room had a full size iron and ironing board.
The rooms have free Wi-Fi which was easy to log onto. You can upgrade to a faster 5mb service for $10 per day but unless you have to download large files the free service is more than adequate. They also have a business centre with reasonable rates for light computer use and printing; and for those with flights to catch they let you check in online and print off your boarding pass free of charge.
All the staff I encountered were very friendly and helpful.
I would happily recommend the New Yorker to my friends and will stay there again.",Likeahurricane,2010-10-01,122005,2010-11-08,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Wonderful hotel in a central location, we could do the whole city from here.” We couldn't believe our luck that we chose so well when it came to chosing the hotel.

It was a great place to start out from in the morning, and a great place to return to in the evening. Comfortable beds, good bathroom and great views from the windows. The fact that the windows opened was an unexpected bonus. The art deco furniture and fittings, the carpet etc. were great. We loved it.

"“Fantastic location and great tourist hotel`” This hotel was chosen having seen the reviews on Trip Advisor and although there were some negative comments, the majority of the reviews were good. I also was impressed by the fact that it was one of the few hotels where the management actually read the comments put on Trip Advisor and responded to the reviews. That swung the choice for me as it showed care and attention to the customer's experience. 
I was therefore pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel was much better than I had expected it to be. The delightful receptionist , Ada, was charming and friendly when we arrived and gave us a lovely room on the 37th floor with breathtaking views across the city to the financial district. It was a super welcome to this fabulous city. 
The double room, though not large, was spotless and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and the over-the-bath shower unit worked fine. I used earplugs, so the airconditioning unit inside the room did not bother me, as it had some reviewers. I was not disturbed by other guests either.
The TickTock Diner in the hotel served delicious breakfasts with a great selection (and great service) - highly recommended! 
The efficient concierge facility in the hotel enables bookings to be made for tourist attractions, like the Circle boat trips and for Broadway shows.
You just can't beat the location of this hotel. It is situated Midtown and you can walk to all the main tourist attractions from there - didn't use the subway once! It was built in 1929 apparently and the art deco features have been preserved. Every member of staff I encountered were helpful and friendly, which is so important for a guest's experience.
If the management were thinking of making any improvements - then I would suggest that the reception area could do with a little style makeover - such as a smarter rug, nicer armchairs and flower arrangements, rather than potted chrysanthemums - just to lift the entrance - but what is there is adequate and not unbearable - it all just looked a little brown or shades of brown!. I noticed that other reviewers have said this - so management , please take note. A few dollars spent here would make a huge difference to the entrance. It was obviously very grand in its heyday when it first opened, and is historically an an important city landmark, and I feel the hotel deserves a nod to its heritage.
I would certainly recommend this hotel as a very good tourist class hotel, very clean and comfortable with great breakfasts in a fantastic location. What it is not, is a fourstar plush hotel, so don't go expecting that. Having said that, and having read negative comments about it, it was so much better than I had expected.",FirsttimeinNYC,2010-10-01,122005,2010-11-04,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

I enjoyed having a view of the river from my room and not looking at another building 10 feet away. Conveniently, Starbucks & Penn Station is located just across the street.

"“Not a bad hotel, just think of the location with NY!” I stayed in the New Yorker hotel for 5 nights with my parents as part of a 9 night trip to the US. After a flight and somewhat expensive cab journey, we arrived at the hotel. Lesson 1 - go and get the normal yellow cabs which are metered, try and avoid the attentions of other taxi drivers that will charge $25 per person for the trip!
The lobby is impressive, very grand and presentable. Checking in was pretty straight forward, apart from the fact that they had us down for staying for 4 nights not 5, but the staff were very helpful and this was corrected within minutes. 
When you get to your room, be prepared for something that is very basic and no frills. Now dont get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the hotel. You have to remember that it is well located and that you will be spending most of your time out and about. But just a couple of things to note. The overall decor is slightly on the dull side, not a room you would take pics of! Also, there are no locks on the bathroom door. And also, in our case, the alarm clock showed the wrong time and was faulty, but that was a very minor thing. But you should be able to get past all that. The staff are friendly and we had no problems with the hotel.
The hotel is very well located, attractions such as Times Square, the Empire State Building and Maddison Square are within walking distance. You are also very close to metro stations that can get you around (and also a train station), but if you dont fancy the metro, then you have hop -on/off bus services that are also a great way to see all the attractions and are reasonably priced. Before you fly out, if you get the chance, it is worth booking a day trip to the Niagra Falls - well worth it, smoe amazing views to be seen!
The New Yorker is pretty much a bed and breakfast place and The Tick Tock diner,which is joined to the hotel, deserves a mention for its breakfasts, decent and enough to satisfy 3 vegetarians like us. New York in general doesn't cater fantastically for vegetarians, but I should note a couple of places. Mi Nidito is on 8th Avenue, between streets 51 and 52 a great mexican that offers a nice environment and a whole page of vegetarian options, great value. Also, on the corner of Lexington Avenue and 26th street, you have Saravanaas, an indian vegetarian restaurant, again great service and value.

"“Couldn't have been better!” This New York City trip was my wife and my first ""kidless"" venture in 15 years, so we wanted to do things right within our budgetary limitations. The New Yorker, although certainly not a cheap hotel, sneaked in there with regard to the budget--we had an abundance of traveler points on our credit card making it much more affordable (free is good). We are so happy to have been able to splurge on the hotel. The staff, room, decor and location of the New Yorker couldn't have been better!! I booked the smallest room--one queen bed, figuring that was all we would need. Mohammed at the front desk absolutely hooked us up!! Not only did he get us a much larger room, he moved us up to the 35th floor with a direct view of the Empire State building. Awesome, especially at night.
The only complaint, if I had to come up with one, is the size of the bathroom, really tiny. But, how much time are you really going to spend in there? It got spotless cleaning every day so go in, get out and hit the streets of NYC!
I would certainly try to get a room toward the top of the building to lessen the street noise, the hotel is right in the middle of the city, across the street from Penn Station. This is, of course, the perfect location. Two blocks from the Empire State, Two blocks from Macy's, 10-15 min walk to Times Square and about 20-25 min walk to Rockefeller Center. We only took one taxi, to get back to the airport. When we didn't feel like walking, Penn station was right across the street.

"“Great Location!” I stayed at the NYH for 4 days in late September, and although this was a blind booking through Priceline, I would plan to stay here again.
Located a half block from Madison Square Garden, half a block from Penn Station and a few blocks from the Port Authority Terminal made this an ideal location for business and leisure and made getting around Manhattan an easy task.
The rooms were recently renovated but are still small (the bathrooms are even smaller!) and the old walls are pretty thin. If you don't plan to be in your room much, this isn't an issue. If you plan to not leave your room at all, please be courteous to your neighbors and try not to do it all night long. Save your lovemaking for the daytime when everyone else is out in the Park!
There are 2 on-site restaurants and a whole city of good eating right outside the front door, so don't limit yourself to whatever's closest.
There's a Staples and a Starbucks across the street, so all your business needs are met.
No pool or hottub, but a decent fitness room nonetheless.
Staff are not outgoing, but not unfriendly either. They are clearly less enthusiastic at 11 and 3, when the lobby is madness with check out and check in. If you can, avoid arriving during peak time and you shouldn't have to wait long.
In all, a good experience and one I would repeat again.",kSarahSarah,2010-09-01,122005,2010-10-25,False,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Staff Training Opportunity” Spent 5 nights here. Hotel is in a great location. Tick Tock Diner ok. Room was adequate in size and had been recently refurbished. Concierge Desk very helpful. The only thing letting this hotel down is the staff on Reception. They don't appear to be happy at all and have no idea how to greet guests. Perhaps there is an opportunity for managment to provide some very needed training.,davelle,2010-10-01,122005,2010-10-22,False,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Please go its fab!!” This hotel is definately situated in the middle of Manhattan and couldn't be easier to get to all local attractions. The room had two double beds and was exceptionally clean and well maintained. All staff in the hotel we very polite and helpfull despite previous reviews.
We ate breakfast at Tick Tock diner which again set you up for the day and only had a snack in the afternoon. The meals in Coopers at the hotel were amazing and the prices were great compared to TGI across the road. TGI's is freezing inside and food very expensive.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone without any doubt and if I am lucky enough to get back to New York I would not consider going anywhere else. I am so jealous if you are heading there soon.

"“Great location, clean, but low value for money” The New Yorker was recommended to me by friends, so we specifically requested this hotel through our agent and paid more than we were initially quoted for another central 4star hotel. We paid about £200 a night ($300 approx) for a basic room. We expected a small room so this was not an issue, but were not so happy with the poor quality bathroom with blackened grouting and damaged tiles. It was clean however so it was more we were disappointed considering what we paid. That night we didn't get much sleep due to some young Americans running up and down the hallway and shouting and laughing as if it was a playground. This was at 2am. A lady from another room asked them to be quiet and they gave her abuse. This was not the hotels fault and when we mentioned to reception the next morning they kindly offered us another room that would be ready that evening on a higher floor with less rooms. We accepted but when we returned that evening and the lady we had spoke to had finished we were then told the room on hold was an upgrade and would be another €30 a night. We explained what was discussed that morning and the receptionist apologised and upgraded us. The room we got had a view of the Hudson River and slightly bigger. We were very pleased and grateful to the hotel for this. The location of the hotel is perfect for everything. We walked everywhere! No public transport necessary other than to get to battery park for the ferries. Tick tick diner is ok but there are other places for breakfast that are nicer so I would recommend exploring. My rating is more based on value. We know NYC is expensive, but for what we paid I expected a bit more from our room - even with the upgrade. There are cheaper hotels in the same category, but unless you get a good deal then I would look around at other hotels. Overall though we had a good stay for the first time in NYC.",GBland,2010-09-01,122005,2010-10-16,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

On our return we got another free upgrade, not quite the suite but nevertheless it was a better room and also free coffee making facilities which are not standard.

"“Great Location!” The New Yorker Hotel definitely beholds some historic features which is what makes it so original. The rate was great and within budget. I booked for $140 per night (tax & fee incl.) through HotWire. 
The hotel is huge and located right on 8th & 34th st. near Madison Square Garden. Subway is across the street (34th Penn Station) which is extremely convenient!! The room was decent size, modernized and had private bath. Had flat screen TV with cable, free Wi-Fi, dresser, and ice bucket was a plus (I like my water chilled so this was handy for the 6 nights stay). There is a business center (open 24hr), a small fitness center (a plus for my bf), and a diner (Tick Tock Diner). The hallway was quite dim and the elevator area was surrounded by mirrors (kinda eerie but I like how it has an old-age look and feel). Staff was friendly.

"“great location, great atmosphere, great service” My husband and I were planning a long weekend trip to NYC and based upon the price and the Trip Advisor reviews, I chose The New Yorker. I was very pleased with my choice! We were given a room with a perfect view of the Empire State Building. The hotel is well situated in the city, within walking distance from the Javits Convention Center, Chelsea area, and Times Square. It is also very close to Penn Station, which we never required because we walked to everything. The area is well populated and safe. Plenty of restaurants are close by. We ate breakfast every morning in the Tick Tock Diner onsite...the food was delicious and the service very prompt and friendly. The diner is open 24 hours, and we stopped by one night for some NY cheese cake....delicious! 
The hotel room was clean and roomier than what I expected for NYC. All the staff were very friendly, polite, and helpful. There is a gift shop onsite for those ""have to get"" souvenirs. 
The lounge/bar area is very nice, and the service there was impeccable as well. 
The transportation desk was very helpful, and set us up with a car hire to the airport on our morning of departure.

"“A very classy, quiet and lovely stay.” The service at the hotel was excellent. It happened to be a very cold and rainy May week, therefore, we ate at the hotel restaurants almost daily and the food was excellent. The diner was reasonable priced and all the entrees were delicious.
I was with family but had my own room. It was quaint, super clean and very comfortable. 
I've traveled to New York several times in the past and this was the first time in this location. I love the Madison Square Garden and had the luxury of walking there and take in the site. I felt very safe even at night. I was surrounded by several restaurants and stores for shopping making my visit a memorable one.
I loved the area that I was in. We drove to New York and since the hotel did not have parking, the vehicle was some distance away.

"“Great stay: Beautiful Art Deco stylings” First, no bed bugs. Yay! We were very nervous about traveling to NYC with all the news reports; we were very thorough in checking the linens and bed upon arrival, and had no incident. Secondly, as fans of art deco, we LOVED this place; they have lovingly taken care of lots of little details in retro-fitting the style and feel of everything. You can tell the place has age and character, but it has really nice modern amenities and little polishes in everything (lovely flat screen tv, bed and lighting fixtures, etc) without losing it's art deco style. So happy this old gem has found new life and a very loving management. Very central to the jacob javtiz convention center, and loved the convenience of the tik tok diner. (not the world's best food, but it did the job, and you can't beat the location!)
The only downsides were that it is kind of pricey (we had good rates, but taxes really made it add up), and we had to wait forever to check in /check out our bags out of the coat check. Also, had some problems with the free printing service from our room, but that was very minor.

Room clean, bed very comfortable. If you are a light /medium sleeper, suggest you ask for room away from street as the sound proofing provided by room windows is not very good - being New York, the traffic noise continues all night. - I was allocated a street side room on arrival & after 1st night asked for quieter room so that I could get a good night's sleep (the reception staff arranged this very quickly).

September 2010 was a different matter altogether - first shock was a new $90 per person ""guarantee"" taken from our credit card at check-in rather than the usual zero swipe of the card that was done last year - this year we could accommodate the deduction from our spare cash but last year would have left us in significant difficulties as we were on a very tight budget. And then the hotel itself was a disappointment, room was not cleaned very well, some staff in the diner disinterested and to top it all my partner was assaulted by a lunatic in the foyer (not a hotel guest!).

"“The Good and Bad...” My sister and I just returned from a 4 day trip to New York. We stayed in the New Yorker based on the good reviews and the great package deal we were able to get including airfare. The location was great- a few blocks from Times Square....across the street from the Subway entrance, near lots of cheaper food options (Quiznos, Wendys, Starbucks, etc) 
As other people have said, the Lobby is really beautiful, however the rooms are only so so. The size of our room was adequate for the two of us (we had 2 queen beds) and we were in a corner where we had windows on both sides, which helped the room seem a little bigger. The room seemed old, but relatively clean. The bathroom was definitely small. The toilet seat looked like it should be in a children's school (very small and low to the ground), and there was no counter to put any toiletries on- only a small shelf above the sink. The bathroom did not seem quite as clean. It had some dirty grout stains and things like that. However it was still fine. Especially for the price in comparison to other hotels in New York. 
Here is where we had a problem. When we got to our room, it was pretty cold and so we turned the heat on a couple of degrees higher. After we got settled, we went out to do some sight seeing. When we came back- our room seemed colder than ever. We figured it might just take some time to get the room warm. We went to sleep that night, and neither of us had ever been so cold (and we live in a very cold climate). We ended up sleeping in sweaters and even putting the blankets over our heads and one point to try and stay warm. 
The next morning, we called down to Guest Services to let them know that our heat didn't seem to be working and to see if someone could fix it. The guest services number told us if we were in need of an immediate amenity request to call a different extension (which ended up being the consierge desk). The woman who answered, Natalie, apologized for the problem and said she'd send a request over to the engineers right away. When we got back early afternoon, the room was still freezing. We called down to the same extension again and Natalie said she would put in a 2nd request so we should definitely get it taken care of this time. When we got back that night, the room was even more cold. This time I called the front desk to ask for the manager. The manager told us that there is no heat available in the hotel right now..that they don't turn it on until later in the year. So us turning on the ""heat"" was actually just blowing more cold air in our room. I was a little frustrated by this, since we had been told all day that someone could come fix it when this wasn't the case. So I requested that we either be switched to another room that might not be quite as cold, or have them send up some blankets. They did send up some blankets that night and that did help. 
That night and next day we kept the ""air"" turned off and tried to keep the door to the room open while we were there to let in some of the warmer air from the hallway. It was so hard to be in our room at all....you felt like you needed to wear a warm jacket and slippers all the time. Our room never did warm up. I can't imagine that everyone elses room's felt like this....like I said. We are from a very cold, snowy environment but this room was definitley colder than we were used to. 
Anyway- besides that incident it was a great location, pretty clean and we felt safe in the area. I just wished they would turn their heat on sooner!",Shmoofee,2010-10-01,122005,2010-10-07,False,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.9,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great location, fantastic view, good service, old bathroom” Location could not have been better for exploring Manhattan and we liked the street it is on. My daughter and I walked to Times Square, Broadway theatre district and 5th Avenue shops which were all close. Also up to Central Park, down to Ground Zero and the Staten Island ferry. Need good shoes for it but do-able if reasonably fit. Hotel is big and attractive, lobby staff helpful and efficient. We upgraded to a large room on 29th floor with view of Empire State building, Madison Square garden and in the distance, the Chrysler. Even up here you know its the city that never sleeps but the beds were comfy (2 doubles) and we slept well even with the curtains open to enjoy the view as much as possible. We suspected the bathroom would not be impressive as we couldn't find a photo anywhere on the web - we were right. Very small and old fashioned with numerous coats of paint to make up for it. Not enough surfaces for 2 girls and none near a mirror but we were happy with it overall as we had heard NY rooms are very small and this wasn't. We chose this hotel over others as it was a fair price, good location and looks iconic NY. We used very few facilities as we were out and about all the time but concierge, transport ($65 to JFK for private car) and luggage store ($1 per bag) were efficient and reasonable. We stayed 4 nights to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday and can recommend some nice restaurants - The View; revolving restaurant at top of Marriott Marquis, Times Square (fantastic at sunset, pricey but worth it for the view), Balthazar; buzzy local in Soho with cocktail bar and great atmosphere, and River Cafe; just under the Brooklyn Bridge with fab view looking back at Manhattan - a definite special occasion restaurant ($$$$) with twinkly lights in garden an entrance like a florist and excellent service. We ate once in the diner downstairs which was fine and convenient. Best tip - hire bicycles to ride round Central Park. $30 for 2 bikes for 2 hours (you may get even better rate online in advance). We cycled once all way round then twice more avoiding the hill at the North end - you have to stick to the few roads as the rest is pedestrianised. No better way to see the park.

Our room had two double beds and we had plenty of room. It was very nicely decorated. And the view... What can I say.. to look out your bedroom window and see the Empire State Building in all its finery. The beds and pillows were so comfy and very welcoming after a long day sightseeing around Manhatten. The shower took a little bit of tweaking to get the right temperature but once you got used to it, it was fine.

"“Would go back in a heartbeat- Location Location Location- And True NY Style” We booked this hotel after out initial travel plans to stay at another NYC hotel fell through, and were we glad they did! If you want a location that has everything on your doorstep, creating the true ""in the movies"" feel, then this is the hotel for you. With Madison Sqaure Garden on the same crossroads as the hotel, and Macy's and the Empire State Building oe the same street just one block away, you couldn't ask for better. 10 minutes walk in the other direction will bring you to Times Square and Grand Central Station. 
The Hotel itself is reminiscent of an old 40's Hollywood glamour film, with many of the origional 1920's fixtures and decor still in place. With the New York Art Deco style of it's construction era, it gives the feeling any tourist visiting the city would want to experience.
We paid the extra to have The New Yorker room, and I'm glad we did, as the room size was fine for the time we were there, but wouldn't have wanted anything even slightly smaller. Plus, the view from our room was phenomenal, looking right out over the city. The TV was all HD, and obviously all the US standard channels are in English. The only complaint we would have about the room was that the shower head was fixed in place, and my partner being quite tall had to crouch to down whenever he used it, not ideal but harldy a major issue. It didn't effect me!
The staff were very accommodating. A lady behind the main desk is a bit miserable but she doesn't have much effect on your time there. The doormen/bell-boys/concierge were very helpful with bags, holding them for us, getting us taxis, giving directions, and just all round pleasant people.
For breakfast the Tick Tock diner is the best we had. They have every kind of breakfast you could want; fruit, English, Irish, Continental, American, Pancakes, Waffles and every kind of egg under the sun. The restaurant 'Coopers' that is attached to the hotel was fine too. We each got a steak and the food was delicious, but that made up for the lack of atmosphere. Being a hotel restaurant there were a lot people just having a casual drink after shopping or travelling, or using it as a meeting place, so not the most glamorous you could ask for. But if you just want good food and can't be bothered to go far, this is ideal.
We are planning a return trip in the future, and there's a very high chance we'll be staying at the New Yorker when we do. But do bare in mind, you are not paying a premium for this hotel, so don't expect the Four Seasons; you just get a good deal for your money.",Rachael02,2010-09-01,122005,2010-10-02,False,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Hotel & Location” Booked this hotel after reading reviews on this site. The hotel upgraded our room to a New Yorker which was much appreciated. Our room (2107) had a view of the Hudson River, it was spacious enough and spotlessly clean. The staff were very courteous and helpful, which made our stay all the more enjoyable. The location was perfect and we would definately stay here again. The Tick Tock Diner was also very good for breakfast as was the Skylight Diner on 34th street. Times Square, ESB, Rockefeller Centre, etc are all walkable from this location. We purchased the 7 day subway pass $27 each and was excellent value. (see our trip report).",azzuro,2010-09-01,122005,2010-10-02,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Would definately go back” Stayed at the New Yorker for 4 nights with my husband and 2 friends. Brilliant location right next to Madison Square Gardens, walking distance from The Empire State Building, and Macey's. The room we stayed in was small but clean, and the bed was very comfortable. The Tick Tock Diner within the Hotel was good value, and the service was excellent. There are loads of Bars within walking distance. The only disappointing thing was that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. We took a small kettle with us which did trick. We didn't spend much time there anyway. For a meal that is a bit more expensive, try Maloney and Porcelli at 37 east 50th Street. The crackling pork is amazing, huge, but delicious, and the steak is to die for!. Ask for a doggy bag if you can't finish it! Woodbury Common shopping outlet is a day trip, with 220 stores, it;s about an hour away, we booked online before we went and picked up the tickets from the local bus station (port authority) a 15 minute walk away. There is another outlet nearer in New jersey (Jersey Gardens).

"“Money pinching Nasty Receptionists” After a long journey we arrived at hotel ignored by receptionist then told we were to early to book in and to come back later, I asked at that time if the room was the twin one that I had requested I was told yes it was and the room would ready at 3. When we returned and saw a different receptionist we were told that we would have to pay an additional $25 + tax per night for the twin room, also if you want a fridge in your room that was another $20 per night. The icing on the cake was we had to pay them to keep our luggage for 5 hours on checking out day. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and I have never paid for luggage storage before.

"“Fabulous second stay at the NewYorker” This was our second stay at the NewYorker and it was great. We had a fabulous room on the 33rd floor with a view of the Empire state. Room had been refurbished and was lovely with nice linens, cushions and lamps - shame that the bathroom hadn't been re-done however as this lets the hotel down. The room was spacious for 3 of us with 2 double beds, 2 chairs, coffee table, walk in closet and pleanty of draw space. Also a 32inch flat panel LCD TV. No tea/coffee facilities or fridge which would be good but to lie in bed and have the empire state building as your view was fantastic and so we could live with that.
Few pointers for would be travellers:-
*Very near Penn station.which is a big plus point for easy access everywhere - especially if arriving from Newark airport as you can get the train to Penn and that it is very easy - better than shuttle or taxi.
*Starlight diner for very reasonble food is only one block back from the hotel - can recommend both price, food and size of portions here
*Near Kmart for food/drinks - use ice bucket and sink filled with ice to keep drinks chilled
*Near empire state, Macys, Herald square and Times square is walkable from hotel.
*Pleanty of shopping and fast food around - Mc D and Burger King are oposite and around the corner respectively.
*Negatives were we couldn't get a late check out and leaving luggae is charged per bag
*Once checked out cannot use the loos etc for changing, as you need a room car to access them - but I think front desk may help here if necessary",Misstq,2010-09-01,122005,2010-09-30,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Really nice hotel and good location” I wanted to let thers know this was a very nice hotel and I would stay there again. It is ideally located in the centreof the island and you can get taxis from right outside the otel to almost anywhere locally. The sub way is just around the corner. Our room was small as we were supposed to have 4 in our party, one dropped out last minute so our room was just fine for 3 of us. We had two double beds, a large television, a small bathroom, and a small closet. However our room looked straight out onto the Empire State Building and as we were on level 37 of 40 it was quite a view. The gift shop was very convieneient and so was the internet access. You do need to pay with a credit car for the internet. We used the Tick Tock diner however the food was rather average. We preffered to use the Stage Door diner which was 60 seconds away instead especially fortheir breakfasts. The staff were great and we recommend the use of the free safety deposit box. The room also had air conditioning which came in very useful. I also wanted to say that the beds are reeealy comfortable, the best way to have a good night sleep when jet lagged. A classically styled hotel which is great value.",lujones87,2010-09-01,122005,2010-09-29,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“perfect for us” our 25th wedding anniversary trip to NYC was class and the hotel lived up to our hopes. We emailed ahead requesting a room with a nice city view and wow did we get it! Floor 36 and looking straight out at the Empire State building, what a sight to go to sleep to and waken up with :) 
The staff were excellent and really polite and considerate.
We did Liberty travel helicopter ride and 3 of the NYC by foot free walking tours which covered lower Manhattan, mid town Manhattan and Greenwich village areas....go on them. Just tip at the end of the tour, 2 hrs long covering 1 to 1 1\2 miles and suitable for young and old. Luke and Renee were excellent tour reps. Check them out at nycbyfoot.com. We recommend the bicycle tour of Central Park.
All the shops you need in Manhattan so don't think a trip to Jersey Gardens or Woodbury Common is necessary. 
Try the chicken saltimbucca in the restaurant in the New Yorker, called Coopers, it is lush. Blueberry pancakes and maple syrup in Tick Tock diner are umm.",amyamy1,2010-09-01,122005,2010-09-28,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location - great hotel!!!” We recently stayed at the New Yorker for five nights (our first time in New York City). Location of hotel was perfect to many things with Penn Station only a couple of minutes away. Our room was nice even though on the small side but as everyone says, who goes to New York to stay in their room. Maid service was excellent, lobby staff was courteous and helpful. I wasn't all that impressed with Tick Tock restaurant but my husband thought the food was okay. Many little restaurants and fast food outlets nearby as well as a couple of Starbucks. There is a Tim Horton's in Penn Station. Also saw two or three other Tim Horton's throughout the area. A Duane Reade pharmacy across the corner from the hotel made it convenient for picking up bottles of water, soda, snacks, etc. Overall, a wonderful trip and I would stay at the New Yorker Hotel again.",islandergal41,2010-09-01,122005,2010-09-28,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The hotel's 24 hour diner, the Tick Tock was wonderful. The prices were fair, the portions huge and the food was served quickly. Above all, the food was good.

"“Excellent Location” Stayed at The New Yorker for 4 nights. Hotel is in an excellent location - across the street from Maddison Square Garden, 15 mins walk from Times Square, 5 mins walk to Macys and 10 mins walk to the Empire State building.
The hotel foyer is grand and impressive. Front desk staff were extremely polite and helpful and efficient. Our room (renovated Metro room) was on the small side but beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean - the maid came every day to change linens and tidy up. Room size really did not matter to us as we wanted to see the city, not sit in our room all day! The hotel lifts are quick, despite there being so many rooms in the hotel. My only critisism is that tea and coffee making facilities have to be requested, something which I feel should be standard for the cost per night.
Tick Tock Diner, attached to the hotel, is a little on the expensive side (especially for breakfast) but the service was quick. There is a TGI Fridays and a 24hr McDonalds accross the street and various other eateries along Eighth Avenue. There is plenty to see and do in NY, I would recommed the Gray Line Downtown bus tour (red buses) to familiarise yourself with the city, and see the sights. Just be aware that you are required to tip for EVERYTHING, usually between 15-20%, and restaurant prices are exclusive of tax. Look out for the freebies, especially the ferrys which are free and give great views of the Statue of Liberty, plus on certain days some museums are pay by donation, rather than the usual standard price. Yellow cabs from JFK cost a standard $45 plus tolls (around $5), make sure you dont get in a gypsy taxi, there is an official taxi rank at each terminal in the airport.",Laurath,2010-09-01,122005,2010-09-26,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Decent place to stay” Stayed here from 3rd-7th of September 2010. We booked into a double room. the room was smallish but adequate enough for sleeping.That is all you need a room for in NYC. Within 5 minutes of entering the room we found a cockroach in the bathroom. We rang front desk to enquire as to how to deal with it. I thought they would've been able too come to the room and spray it to kill it. but straight away they apologised and moved us to a suite on the 39th floor with a nice view of the hudson. We hadn,t even requested to be moved rooms, all we asked was could someone kill the cockroach. So we were suprised and delighted to get a new room without requesting it.
The hotel is exactly what you need in NYC. It is fairly central. Walk to times square in about 10 mins, one block away from Macys.
The hotel is spotless, security checking room key before you enter the lifts which is good.

The room and bathroom was very clear and in good shape. Unfortunately the old windows leave lots of cold air into the room, but the heating is modern and the room was quickly heated.

"“Exceeded expectations” New York was our third destination on our American honeymoon and after staying at 2 amazing 5 star hotels we knew that the New Yorker Hotel would be just a place to sleep , how wrong. After a long wait to get through customs at JFK we checked in at 11.30pm and with a smile I asked for a room with a good view and a bit of space.Mohammed on reception gave us a suite on the 39th floor with a seperate lounge,kitchen area and an amazing view of the Empire State so we were really impressed and pleased , on the way out we tipped Mohammed as he didnt have to upgrade us but genuinely seemed happy to do so.The staff at the hotel are really helpful ,we've been to New York before so wanted to do new things.The conceirge recommended a bike ride which we did.We cycled along the Hudson over the Manhatten and Brooklyn bridges through the financial district and up to Central park.Can honestly say this was the best day , saw amazing sights, stubbled across a film set, rode alongside taxi's and had a lock so could chain up anywhere for drinks etc. We also took in a comedy show at the Comedy Lounge and although you have to spend a minimum on drinks we had a really good night.We used the subway to get to and from the airport and although I wouldn't use if I was on my own it was very cheap and convienient.New York is still a fab place to visit but is more expensive than I remember so on a couple of occasions we ate slices of pizza for lunch rather than using an expensive sit down deli.The Tick Tock diner is good value though and they make the best milkshakes.Overall couldn't fault the hotel , it was better than expected just ask for a nice room and if like us you could get lucky, also take more money than you think you need.Will definately return to the New Yorker.",lizr78,2010-09-01,122005,2010-09-21,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Retro cool and great location” I have been to New York about 4 times in the last 2 years to visit upstate BUT I have never been able to go on Full Tourist Mode- stay IN the city and check out the landmarks. Finally we booked the trip and made plans to spend 24 hours in the heart of the city...right across from Penn Station - I was so excited !!
The New Yorker is a classic New York Hotel- built in 1929, it was the largest in the city at the time, with 2500 rooms. It was quite the hot-spot at the time too, the nightlife was legendary- even Big Bands like Benny Goodman's played there. When you walk into the hotel, you immediately get the feel of that era. The hotel was reopened after many years of being closed in 1994 and they made sure to keep things looking as though you've stepped back in time. The Doorman/Valet was great and offered some helpful tidbits about the parking situation ( yes, we had a car since we drove upstate). Parking runs about $35 per day and the garage is about half a block down the side street- I guess that's typical New York. The lobby is sandwiched by two restaurants - the traditional Tik Tok Diner on one side, and the semi-formal Copper's Tavern on the other. We ate breakfast at the Tik Tok- big portions but the food was not great.
The rooms are dinky but nicely appointed. As we were only staying one night- we got the basic room but I have seen on their website that they do have larger rooms available. If you feel at all claustrophobic- I would recommend getting the larger accommodations. We were in a corner, with a room right next to us and we heard the guests in that room going in and out and chatting. The bathroom is very small with a tub/shower. Again, I understand that this is standard for the city- I personally am just not used to it. You do get a flat screen on the wall and there is free Wifi but if you want ice, you have to go down about 3 floors. I have to say though, I'm not sure whether it was just real comfy or I was exhausted from walking everywhere but I slept like a rock in that dinky room !.

"“Fantastic hotel, great value and very friendly staff!” I stayed at the New Yorker in February this year with my partner who accompanied me whilst I scoped out the galleries as part of my university course. The staff made us feel very welcome, which was a real treat after the hassle at the airport. 
Our room was small, but well decorated and everything we needed was available. The room and the en-suite were both very clean. The only down-side I would say - our toilet was very noisy, which woke either one of us up at night. 
We only ate at one of the hotel's restaurants on one of the nights, when the weather was truly terrible (Worst snow I've ever experienced!!!). This was good value and great service too. 
I loved the fact the hotel seemed to be lively most of the time. Lots of people from all over the world in that expansive lobby! Truly a wonderful experience... Only made more special by my partner who proposed that week.

"“There are better places to stay in New York.” With regards to the other reviews, I dont really agree. You can get so much better in New York for the same price. So all those reviews of ""brilliant"" and ""excellent place"" and ""the best location"",... I just don't really understand.
The hotel is Art Deco, now, I personally find this positive if has been renovated since that period, which I am not sure the New Yorker has. The corridors are dark, its all made in a wrong-brown colour, every wall and corner is chipped, bumped or otherwise has marks of heavy use. Paint is falling of the elevator doors, the furniture is tired looking, and I could go on and on. Furthermore, the corridors are not well lit. All these things make this place look like a sad place. Its not a positive feeling you get in this hotel. It looks a bit like some of those hotels in the movies where all sorts of wrong and illegal things happen, not positive. This then goes on to the room that again looks old. Well, our bathroom had received what looked to be hundreds of coats of paint, but paint does not hide everything. Again, it all looks old and dirty.
Now with the above said, I do not know if this hotel is clean, because of all the marks everywhere it gives the hotel a dirty look, add to this the brown carpets etc, and you really do not want to know what is in them. I did not feel comfortable in this hotel at all. They can have all the good cleaning staff in the world, this hotel still looks like a dirty old skanky place. 
It needs a complete overhaul. If you want something that looks fresh and renovated, go to a Hilton Garden or something in that category. There is one down the street (34th I believe) actually which is so much nicer than the New Yorker and has a better location, for about the same money. I will certainly use the Hilton instead for my future New York trips.
Furthermore, I got my room from Hotwire and it was already 20% off. I dont know how true that is, but I even found that price too much for what it was. 
Business centre? Yes downstairs in the horrible looking cellar where you can buy internet time with your credit card. It looks so dodgy I wouldnt use my credit card there. Second of all, nowadays, most places have free wireless. 
Location? Everyone seems to rave about the location. Again, there are so many hotels uptown, downtown, midtown, whatever you want, so I think the location is alright only. 8th Avenue is not a brilliant place, not a lot to do on 8th Avenue, except if you want to visit the local strip joints.
I personally do not understand how people can find this place brilliant. When we were checking in, several people were complaining about their rooms, and I second that, this place is not worth the money, go somewhere else.",The-Eur0pean,2010-08-01,122005,2010-09-18,False,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.6,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Hotel and location” We stayed at the New Yorker Hotel from 31 August to 4 September and really enjoyed our stay. Given the previous reviews we were expecting a small room, but were pleasantly surprised: The room was large enough for our requirements and the decor was of a good standard. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and polite. The hotel is located in the midtown arear, with the Empire State building, Macy's and fashion street very close. Time Square was a walkable distance.
Our next stop was Boston and as we didn't have a car, we needed to use public transport to get from NYC to Boston. We used the Bolt Bus company which cost us USD39 for two single tickets, which left from the side of the New Yorker Hotel... very convenient. 
We loved NYC and cant wait to go back and will be happy to re-book the New Yorker Hotel.",jayandpen,2010-09-01,122005,2010-09-18,False,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Brilliant and clean with perfect location.” If you planning a trip to New York Stay here (flights with Continental, cheap and really good, was worried but just as good as Virgin)
Stayed in the New Yorker hotel for two night before flying on to las Vegas. Have previously stayed in the Marriott and Double Tree on times Square which are also good but come with a high price.
When I return to New York next I would 100% stay at this hotel. Have no worries or doubts. The hotel is in a perfect location only a short walk to Macys and Times Square.
The Hotel, rooms were really clean and modern, with everything working perfectly. The staff at the hotel are also very kind and helpful. Security at the lift checking your room keys before you go up to your room was a piece of mind.

"“Excellent location” Perfect location. Our rooms had a view of the Empire State building and the hotel was just 2 minutes from Macy's. Being just a few minutes walk from Penn station made transfer from the airport very easy and there were 3 different Metro train lines that were within a few minutes walk. Times square was just 10 minutes or so away.
The room was on the small side but for the price, $250 a night, that was to be expected.
Best of all was the attached Tick Tock Diner which had an extensive menu and served food 24 hours a day at very reasonable prices.",Deathless,2010-09-01,122005,2010-09-16,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“No frills but fully functional” Just back from 5 nights in the New Yorker. We stayed on the 34th floor which did have some pretty amazing and vertigo inducing views which was good, however the small room was pretty basic and would certainly benefit from a decorating job. It wasnt that there was anything particularly wrong with the room but its just missing a bit of attention to detail. The bathroom has some paint missing in places, the tiles needed re-grouted, whilst the carpet in the bedroom was fairly worn. All irrelevant details in the grand scheme but prevents the hotel and room from being luxurious. The fact the rooms are small was incidental to be honest, we dont need a big room to sleep and freshen up in. All staff were attentive and friendly, the rooms and hotel was clean throughout and both the Tick Tock diner and Coopers tavern were conviniently handy and good quality (although didnt eat in the Tavern). With just a little more loving care this very traditional hotel could recoup some former glory, but isnt quite there yet. Value wise however it probably couldnt be bettered, it was one of the cheapest and as a result I reckon there is far worse hotels in NYC which would be more expensive.",Carpediem1,2010-09-01,122005,2010-09-15,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Amazing Hotel! Forget any bad reviews you wont get as good as here for the great price!!” Arrived at the New Yorker Hotel on 29th August 2010 for 5 nights (arrived from Newark airport which we sailed through without any hassle, much better than JFK so if you can get a flight into Newark make sure you do its alot better and you drive in from New Jersey so can see the skyline on your way in, great start to the holiday!) was greeted by Tony on the front desk, advised us our room wasnt ready yet but we werent too bothered we was in New York, they gave us visitors passes to use the downstairs toilets to freshen up which was good because atleast you know anyone isnt walking into the hotel or the toilets!! Went back later on to see if our room was ready and was advised it wasnt but the lady on reception (she didnt have a name badge but she made us feel very welcome and was really really helpful) gave us another room and helped us with the safety deposit box. She also advised us we needed to leave a $200 something deposit for the room which the travel agents didnt tell us about, but she sorted that for us ;) which we really appreciated as we hadnt budgeted for this deposit. 
When we finally got to the room, first thing i done was pull the curtains over to check the view, and yes it was of the Empire State Building!! We could also see Madison Square Garden and a little bit of the Chrystler Building. The room was small yes but i thought nice and cosey. The beds were really comfy and 2 pillows each which were also very comfy and best of all, no sign of bed bugs! The rooms had flat screen tvs, ice buckets aswell which came in handy as NY was very hot when we were there and on each floor is vending machine for sweets and drinks. You even got new yorker hotel toiletteres. Maids were in everyday and done a great job. This is the perfect hotel if you are wanting to stay in NY. Few blocks down is Times Square and in the opposite direction Greenwich Village is only straight down the road (but we got the bus to Greenwich Village and coming back the bus stopped right outside, buy a map from the gift shop downstairs which lists all the bus routes and were the bus stops are of the bus you need to be on, if you do decide to get the bus they are nothing like England, you need $2.25 exactly in quarters ONLY. Overall a great 2nd trip to NY (last time i stayed in the Edison Hotel i have wrote a review on here for that also) and the New Yorker made it even more special! Thank you very much!
P.S if you email the hotel before you go, ask them to upgrade you to an empire state view, its an extra $30 a night and so worth it (some ppl get it free but were not all that lucky)!!

"“Would definitely stay there again” It was my 6th visit to New York and my first time at the New Yorker Hotel.
Reasons for my choice were the awesome location and a good offer.
Location: The New Yorker Hotel is located at 34th Street and 8th Ave. next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. The Empire State Building, Macy's, Times Square, etc. are all just a hop away.
Right by the hotel is a Starbucks and a Duane Read where one can get all necessary stuff. 
There's also a subway station - ideal location for shopping and sight-seeing
Eating: The hotel has a few own restaurants. The Tik Tok Diner is open 24/7 and offers a variety of typical US dishes such as burgers, sandwiches, etc. Prices are good too. Staff is nice.
Check-in: check-in was quick and easy. Front-desk staff was very nice 
Room: my room was located on the 24th floor. I didn't have city view, but the room was light. (see pictures)
Room-type: Metro, 1 Queen-bed, renovated
Price: €630 for 3 nights - booked via expedia
Having stayed at several hotels in New York I was very positively surprised about the room. It looked modern, new and trendy. It included a desk, flat-screen TV, a little extra room for luggage / clothes, a bathroom, queen-bed, etc.
Everything was tidy.
Room-size: New York is known for small hotel rooms. The room was not as small as expected and spacey enough for 2 people. (even enough room to move properly)
Bathroom: the bathroom was clean and served it's purpose. The hotel also offered a set of sanitary products.
The only negative thing was that not all of the towls were clean.
Generally the room was perfect.
Downside: walls are very thin and it's a little noisy - you hear when the next-room neighbours turn on their shower or flush the toilet. Also the air-condition is very loud, but it can be turned off.
Housekeeping: very nice 
Check-out: Since my flight was late I asked for late-check-out.
The usual check-out time is 12:00 noon. You can ask for a free later check-out until 1:00pm. If you wish to check-out even later you have to call the front-desk the morning of your departure if the room was available longer. If so a late-check-out-rate of $75 has to be paid and you can stay up to 5:00pm.
Ground transportation: the guys are very helpful and help you with getting a cab / shuttle or whatever.
Extras: the hotel has a business center as well as a fitness room. There is also a gift shop in the lower lobby with plenty of nice NY gifts. You can also get postcards and stamps there. 
Best thing free wireless !!!

Found our room to be clean and comfortable. We had been worried about bed bugs but needlessly. Very good cupboard space within room for clothes, cases etc. 
Booked 5 months ago and as it was a special retirement trip had asked for a room at the front with a good view. Therefore a little disappointed that we were given a room at the side.
The concierge ladies were very friendly and helpful.

the room was OK after we switched. the first room reeked of cigarettes even though we specified a non smoking room. the bathroom was not OK. a little dirty, very small and old looking.
there was a fire alarm that went off during our stay. we had to evacuate, but it was fun because we were able to stand in the street as the NY firefighters came through.

"“Ideal Location, Great Staff & Recommended!” My friend and I recently stayed at The New Yorker for a 5nt shopping/sightseeing break. The hotel is in an excellent location, adjacent to Penn Station, opposite Madison Square Gardens and close to The Empire State Building and Time Square.
We found all the staff we came across to be very polite, courteous, professional and excelling in customer service. We were pleasantly surprised to find that our room (no 2324) was huge, compared to New York standards. We even had 2 bathrooms which is a real bonus for 2 girls! And as if the bathrooms weren't enough of a treat for us, the beds and pillows were the most comfortable that I have ever come across on my extensive travels. My friend wanted to take her pillows home with her! 'Do they sell them?' she asked. There wasn't much of a view from this room, but who goes to New York and wants to sit in their room and look out of the window? 
After reading the reviews of the Tick Tock Diner, we decided to have breakast there on our 1st morning. The food and the service was so good that we ate there every morning and also one evening for dinner.

If you don't mind walking you are also close to Times Square. My room did not have a great view, this did not bother me as I was not going to be living in there 24/7. Tick Tock diner staff very friendly. A big thanks to Salvatore who sold me my tea and croissant in the morning :o)

"“This is what all city centre hotels should aspire to” Running hotels in London for many years, we stayed here because my son's friends raved about it last year. I was dubious as could've stayed elsewhere with collegues I knew. No need. From the moment I spoke with Irina in reservations to arrange some goodies in our rooms on arrival, I felt confident, and when we arrived, I simply couldn't fault the place. I do switch off when I'm not working, but can't help but notice the subtlies of the business. 
Not once in four days/nights did we encounter a single member of staff who wasn't genuinely a credit to the hotel, from reception, and my repeated trips to the safe deposit boxes, to porters, maids, security and the staff in the Tick Tock diner (which the boys loved, espec for breakfast). Staff make or break a hotel, and there seems to be a genuine atmosphere of pride & team spirit here. I loved it and will stay next visit without hesitation.
It's worth the extra few dollars for a 'City View' room. As the boys walked in, their faces were were a pure kodak moment. There, in front of them was the Empire State Building and the Chrysler to the left. Great sight at night too.
The goodies for the boys (a soda & chips' basket) beautifully presented and the cards in each room exactly as requested. Thanks Irina, I'm sure they know they have an asset in you!
It's quiet in the rooms and comfortable, so sleeping was good, and everything works as it should. With 96 degrees outside every day the a/c was welcome.

I emailed the Hotel in advance to ask for a room with a decent view of the city as it would be our wedding anniversary during our stay. I received an email saying that they would see what they could do. Upon arrival they said they had managed to sort that out and gave us a free breakfast voucher for our stay congratulating us on our anniversary- a really nice way to start the stay off! Location is superb, we arrived from Penn stn and it was literally a 2 minute walk away. Times Sqaure is a 5 minute walk away and with Penn Stn so close by, all transport needs are covered.

We were able to walk to all the sights,never had to take a taxi or train. Others have commented on the size of the room & yes, it was small, but we only slept there so it was no problem. When we came in that evening we did have A/C issues, but called the front desk & it was taken care of very quickly. The concierge was extremely helpful.

"“Buggy” Judging from this hotel's size and the number of reviews, the Ramada New Yorker hosts a lot of visitors. Based on our experience, it hosts not just the two legged kind. 
One morning, my wife received a bug bite while getting dressed, that turned into a large blister. A doctor diagnosed it as a brown spider bite. Two nights later, she received a second bug bite on her foot while lying in bed, that was not nearly as severe as the first. 
The only consideration the hotel provided us was to move us to another room and appologize for the inconvenience. The manager told me that he had the room checked and ""found no infestation"". He also took the position that that my wife could have been bitten outside the hotel. Ramada customer service seemed sympathetic, but only referred me back to the hotel manager. In the end, we were offered a half-night refund on our seven night stay. 
In our view, bug bites and poor service are unacceptable and avoidable. Our experience at this hotel was not worth the money at any price.

"“Clean, central and friendly” I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel on 8th Avenue (35th street) for a girly weekend. The first thing that hits you as you walk in is the air conditioning - very essential during an August heatwave. The rooms were standard - two double beds for three of us girls. very - comfy . the hotel has a diner attached to it ""tick tock diner"" which gives 24 hour service for takeaway coffee or sit down food. very reasonable and tasty food, with regular refills of coffee and iced water. the maid service was excellent - clean towels, rooms tidied and the beds made daily. A slight problem with a blocked toilet was resolved within ten mins of it being reported.

"“fantastic!” We stayed here for 3 nights at end of August to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday. We had 2 rooms booked and were upgraded to queen rooms with a view on floor 35 and all I can say is WOW! One room was a corner room with a view of the Empire State Building and also a view towards the Hudson River and Madisson Suare Gardens. We slept with the curtains open as the view was simply amazing.
The room was of a good size and very very clean. The only thing missing was a kettle so that we could make a coffee in the morning but we soon discovered the Tick Tock Diner and all I can say is this is not to be missed! The service was fab and the food - unbeleivable! We also had a drink and nibbles in Coopers Tavern and that was also very very good. 
Despite what a lot of reviews say on here - the reception staff were extremely friendly and very helpful as was the bell boys and guys checking your door keys for admittance into the lift.
Great location - really could not have been in a better place - the subway is literally outside the hotel/tick tock diner, and all day tickets $8.25. There are also taxi's constantly outside - $60 includes tip and toll - total cost from JFK to hotel. Macy's, Times Square, Empire State Building all within 10 mins walk.
If we get back to NYC, we will only be looking at booking into this hotel.

"“Handy for Macy's” We stayed for 3 nights in the hotel before transferring by train from Penn Station to DC. Station is 150m from hotel and next to the metro so is very convenient. Many of the sights can be easily walked to if the weather is not too hot! Hotel is clean and cosy, would be especially lovely in winter. We had a family room with 2 double beds so there was plenty of space, bathrooms were well appointed. No fridge or Tea making facilities in the room although ice was available. No valuables were to be left in the room which was OK, however the free safety deposit boxes were at reception.
There are plenty of cafes / bakeries for a morning snack nearby and a 24 hour pharmacy and grocery store across the road. We only used the Tick Tock Diner once for brunch, we ordered 2 breakfasts and extra toast which was more than adequate for 3 of us.
We found New York busy and quite expensive, we bought a city pass for entry into 6 attractions which was good. We managed to do the Empire State Building at 8.15am and had no queue at all, the top of the Rock was equally fine at 7pm, just in time for sunset.",Oxfordians_13,2010-08-01,122005,2010-09-04,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Nice hotel & great location” The New Yorker hotel was a very pleasant surprise for us. In the website pictures the hotel looked a little bit shady and dark, but the reality was much better. Either we were upgraded (we didn't ask & they didn't tell) or I had booked a suite by mistake, but our room was great! We had a separate bed room and living room in 20+ floor. The location was superb! Madison Square Garden, Macy's, Broadway, restaurant all near by and within walking distance. And the diner in the hotel lobby was like in the movies:) Definitely will choose this hotel next time!",Brandon_James,2009-04-01,122005,2010-09-03,False,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“What a Surprise!” This was my first stay at the New Yorker. Got a great summer offer via TravelZoo so thought I'd try it. I have been spoiled by staying at the 4 Seasons and The Plaza, so with the rate I received, I wasn't expecting much. Boy, was I wrong! First Class all the way around. The doormen were especially eager and helpful with cabs in the morning. Since I was with a colleague, I got a suite. Very large with closing door between living area and bedroom. I took the couch, she got the bed. We were there for 4 days - I never woke up once during the night. The room was clean and tended to daily. The Tick Tock restaurant off the lobby is open 24/7 and we ate there several times. Very good.

"“Perfect for our trip” I traveled with my wife and our two kids (1 and 7 years old) for a week in New York. We had some difficulties finding an hotel that had enough space for us, well located and at a reasonable price. After some research we made a reservation for a Junior Suite (a room with a queen size bed + a living room with a queen size sofa bed) in this hotel for 200$/night with breakfast included. It was on the 39th floor, well above the traffic, so we had no problems with the street noise. We had heard that rooms in New York were small but this suite had plenty of space. The room was always clean. The breakfast was also served on the 39th floor where we could see Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty, and the Empire State Building (which is very near the hotel). During the weekend the breakfast was served on the Tick Tock Diner, at street level, which was a hot, cooked breakfast, although more limited. The location was very central, being 5/10 minutes away both from the Empire State Building and Times Square. It's right in front of New York Penn Station so it's really easy to get here from Newark Airport. I highly recommend the Junior Suites for families with kids. It was perfect for us.",Deambulante,2010-08-01,122005,2010-09-02,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great value – Fantastic Location would definitely stay here again” We stayed for 3 nights and what a wonderful time we had in the New Yorker.
Mohammed on the front desk was fantastic and the most helpful person we meet on our whole trip. He arranged a brilliant room with an amazing view of the Empire State Building (5 minute walk) and got several other important things sorted out for us like a safety deposit box at no extra cost 
The Hotel was very very clean. Our room was spotless and the staff where very friendly and helpful and always willing to help.
The New Yorker is in a super location to explore New York. It is only 100 yards from Penn Station and also a short walk to Port Authority where you get the bus back to the airport. The bus return is £27 dollars per person and took us about 45 minutes and they drop you off at the terminal you require.
There is a subway beside the New Yorker and it took us 10 minutes to stroll to Times Square with lots of shops and restaurants on the way. There is a TGI Fridays & Starbucks straight across the road and Macys just 3 minutes walk.

"“Beautiful hotel but small rooms” On check in the receptionist Mohammed was concerned that our 2 rooms were both small double beds (our 19 year old 6' 2"" son & 26 year old daughter shared) he therefor went away & arranged for a large upgraded room with a fridge & 2nd pull out sofa bed for our children at no extra cost to us & gave us both rooms on the 24th floor with views of the Hudson River. Our room was not so good though - a very small bathroom & it was very noisy as the walls were very thin so you could here our neighbours in their bathrooms (we did not complain or ask to move though as they had been so good sorting our kids room. There was no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms but their were ice machines on every other floor. The cleaning staff were very friendly as were the reception desk.
It is in a good location - only a 15 minute walk to Time Square and surrounded by shops & a subway station across the road (however the subways take some getting used to - not easy to know which one goes where and we lost 10 dollars in a pay machine as it was no longer taking notes & did not return our cash! therefor we bought our tickets from manned stations from then on.
If you want to see a family show I recommend the Addams Family it was great fun. It is much cheaper to buy your tickets there rather than in advance as they offer large discounts at the ticket booths.
We went to the Top Of The Rock for our photographs as it has a lovely view of the Empire State too. We also got the ferry to Liberty Island (well worth doing but don't pay the extra for the audio as it spoils your enjoyment and its not needed)
For my husband's birthday I had arranged a family helicopter flight with Liberty Helicopters (we were lucky to get a small helicopter to ourselves and the views were spectacular)
One evening we went to the Rodeo Bar (the address is in their Yellow Pages) great night out in an authentic bar with live music nightly & good food and atmosphere (we asked if we could be seated near the band & they moved tables around to accommodate us.
In general I found the New Yorkers very friendly and everything was very expensive (8 dollars+ for a beer). It was very hot and humid in August so I would recommend not going in the summer as it was draining plus we walked miles! it was VERY busy also.",MandyPlymouthEngland,2010-08-01,122005,2010-08-29,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The room was larger than we thought and the bathroom was nice and clean. The decorations were modern and fit in nicely this the hotel. For being one of the older hotels, it was wonderful!

"“GREAT VALUE - BUT AVERAGE HOTEL.” I stayed here for four nights with my friend, travelling to New York a week or so before Christmas from the UK. Flight was an absolute breeze, flew BA. Arriving at JFK. Taxi ride was about $60 to our hotel. Its very Central in Manhattan, towards more of Times Square area. Defiently a must see but not my favourite part of NY. I prefer more 5th avenue end and Central Park, still very close but just a few Subway Stops. Where as Times Square and Macys department are in your door step LITERALLY! Hotel itself, had a fab check in and it did have work going on through the hotel, was no noise or off put ment. Rooms was OK nothing special, bareable, bit dark, but clean and somewhere to sleep for the evening! Me and my friend got a fantastic rate so we couldnt complain. I had an amazing time travelling to NY for the first time, I have been back since and even though unfortunetly I didnt return to this hotel, I still would recommend it if you can get a Good deal if not there are much nicer and closer hotels to 5th av and Central Park.

"“good hotel, great location” just got back from New York after a 7 night honeymoon stay at this hotel. I emailed the hotel before we went and got a free upgrade on our room. When we arrived at the hotel the lobby does look as impresive as it looks on the hotel website. We were early for check in (11am) but the room was ready and we were able to go straight up to our room. You must have a credit card on checkin or they will charge you 30 dollers a day this is incase you smoke in the room and set of the fire alarm. This was not a problem as i new about this after reading about this on other reviews. But this is not something the hotel tells you about before hand. I have read on this site that the lines for check in were long not something we saw on our stay, and they always had at least four staff on at any one time.
The room its self was looking a bit tired, a few marks on the walls but was very very clean plenty of towels in the bathroom ample space for your stuff. The free wi fi worked fine as did the air con. All in all very good.
We ate in the tick tock diner for both breakfast and dinner a few times . The meals we had were all very good large portiions and the service we got from the staff was good. Apart from the lady who you pay the bill to who was not the most pleasant person. When the bill comes it has the tip you should leave written on 15% we left this in cash on the table and paid the bill with a card.
If you go out of the hotel turn right cross over 34th street and on the corner there is the stage door diner. This is a little cheaper than Tick tock and you get orange juice free with your breakfast so is woth checking out.

Dimensions must be 9 foot by 10 foot at most. the bed is just far enough from the door for it to open. Noise levels are high so you either want to stay high up or on the back of the hotel.

We were allocated room 21 51 and had fantastic views of the empire state building and the manhatten skyline. The room was spotless and remained that way by the great maid service.

"“Great Central Location - Better now the rooms have been updated” This was the second time I have stayed at the New Yorker and I'm glad to say its been improved. The rooms were a little tired 5 years ago, but since then they have all been refurbished and are all great. The bathrooms are small, but clean and everything works. As we went in summer the air conditioning was amazing, real arctic conditions.
To say that most of the reception staff are rude is an understatement! 80% of the receptionists we dealt with were not very pleasant at all. Maybe a joint time of the month! (people say that when women work together they join cycles!!!)
The hotel location is second to non, straight opposite Madison Square Garden and right next to 34St subway station. A few hundred yards along the road is Penn St Station, for the LIRR. Macy's is very near by, and just past Macy's is the Empire State Building. Your very near Time Square and 42nd Street for all the Theatres.

"“Suited us perfectly” Our family of 5 visited NYC and stayed at the New Yorker in a doubles suite. The suite consisted of 2 large rooms - one with 2 double beds and a tv, the other with a sofa bed, desk, large dining table with 6 chairs, fridge, and another tv. There was also a huge L-shaped terrace overlooking the corner of 34th & 8th. So we had magnificent views of the Empire State Building, Madison Square Gardens, as well as views in the distance of many prominent buildings. Our room rate included breakfast vouchers for each day to get a coffee/tea, juice, and muffin/bagel/pastry. We paid an extra $40/night to guarantee ourselves a terrace since we like to unwind on the balcony after a busy day of touring.
The room was clean and newly renovated. The hotel felt very safe with the security at the elevators asking to see your room key. The subway was right at the corner as well as nearby hop-on/hop-off bus stops. It was a 10 minute walk to Times Square or the Empire State Building.
We used the valet parking. There was plenty of space out front to unload so that was not a hassle. It was quite easy to drive in through the Lincoln Tunnel then the hotel is right there.
The gift shop had very good prices compared to the shops around town. We did not eat at the Tick Tock Diner other than our breakfast vouchers. The coffee and muffins were large and good.
The free wifi came in handy mapping out our schedule for the day. The room was surprisingly quiet for sleeping.

"“Convenient and fairly nice hotel” I stayed at the New Yorker during the last week of July. I had heard the place had been recently renovated and we had booked a suite. (2 double beds in the bedroom and the option of a sofa bed)
First impression in the lobby was decent. The lobby does look fairly grand and was a good sign. You can tell the hotel is fairly old by the architecture but was still looked decent. Bag check is $1 a bag I believe which was convenient since our flight landed at 7am in the morning and we couldn't check in until 3PM. Location was also nice as it was right outside 34th & 8th Subway station.
The rooms themselves although recently renovated still did look a little dated. You could tell that the renovation consisted of a new coat of paint, new carpet and a new TV and that was about it. I was expecting a bit more (as in new furniture, etc) but overall the room was pretty good. The suite was pretty spacious (there was a large foyer area at the entrance which opened up to the living room, walk in wardrobe and the bedroom. The bedroom itself was pretty spacious and I was surprised at the size of the walk in wardrobe. (it was large enough to fit a full sized ironing board and still have room for bags, etc)
The only downside I see with this hotel - the security in front of the elevators. I know it's for the safety and security of the guests, but the guys standing in front of the elevator lobby with the area cordoned off just seemed a little excessive and intimidating and really made me feel like a criminal even though I was a guest at the hotel. I'm sure they could approach security in a different way (like keycards to get to certain floors in the elevators) but the security is not necessarily a bad thing.",syee99,2010-07-01,122005,2010-08-13,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Rooms, halls etc do look tired- area isn't the best- all this is true, but irrelevant to a great holiday. Too many people expect too much. Beds fantastic- pillows absolutely terrific. Very handy location for Times Square, ESB, subways etc- found staff very good, excellent transportation service on last day. Our second stay in NY- would return to hotel. One point of criticism - had the worst meal at Coopers- three meals, all awful, esp pizza, which was terrible(cold lumps of mozarella garnishing a dry biscuit), burger was quantity over quality. All meals returned with very little eaten- staff couldn't have given a monkeys. Apart from that- all good.

Large well furnished comfortable room with 2 huge windows looking onto terrific view of Empire State Building on 21st floor. I had emailed manager beforehand asking for a good view of New York and was not disappointed. Arranged a small fridge for the room but felt I was misled on the cost - told $20 dollars for our stay but when I got the bill it was per day plus tax. Hotel movies on tv very expensive and so is internet access.
Always long line of people at reception checking in and out and I needed to wait on average 20 minutes when needing access to safety deposit box.
Waiting staff at Tick Tock diner friendly enough but I got fed up with them telling me how much they wanted as a tip, how they got rotten wages and to give money direcly to them or they would never see it. Plenty of choice available in vacinity for food but TGI Fridays grubby and expensive.

"“Never again!” Having booked this trip with a reputable travel company my elderly parents-in-law were assured that the hotel was fabulous, with luxury rooms, excellent views and a convenient location. We duly arrived for our 6 night stay with high expectations. Our trip was to celebrate a 50th birthday, an 80th birthday and a 55 year wedding anniversary, so a pretty special visit, of which staff were fully aware. While it is certainly not obligatory to do so, not one member of staff acknowledged our 3 major family celebrations.
Having being booked in we were given room keys and headed off to the 22nd floor. Upon entering our room we were confronted by a tiny room overlooking a brick wall, with tired and dated decor, virtually no closet space and a functional (though clean) bathroom. There was one chair, but next to no room to pull it out and sit down. One point of particular note was the traditional 'net' curtain, which was discoloured and creased, adding nothing to an already disappointing ambience,
I was dismayed at this and walked round the corner to my in-laws room, to see how they were getting on, only to find it even smaller and darker, if that is possible!
I contacted reception, who explained that this was what we had paid for, but that they would upgrade us at a cost of $50 per night per room. As a gesture of goodwill the charge was waived for 4 of the 6 nights. I wasn't overly impressed, but the rooms were better, and we were tired and ready to settle in, so we accepted. 
The hotel as a whole was 'ok'. Tick -Tock Diner sold satisfactory food. A nice touch would have been a discount of perhaps 20% for hotel guests, but that didn't happen. Our regular waitress was pleasant and helpful. We tipped her directly, which meant that almost every time we paid the check we were reminded that it was customary to tip. Annoying! The bar was nice, the server friendly, and I was comfortable to sit alone for a short period. Inter net access was available via the 'business centre', though at $10 (approx) per half hour, I thought it expensive.
The location was very central, though the area was quite 'seedy'. However transport links were close and taxis plentiful.
When it came to checking out we found we had been charged more than the fee promised. It took prolonged discussion with the staff before I got the original agreement honoured. If the member of staff who had agreed this had been off that day I wouldn't have been believed at all. As it was we had to wait for her to arrive on duty at lunch time before the matter was resolved. She ammended the bill, but didn't utter a single word of apology. 
In the interest of a a fair review I must point out that at this point I do not know if this standard of room was what we paid for when booking through the agent. It certainly wasn't what we asked for.
I think I'll leave the last words to the member of staff we saw outside my parents -in-law's original room. I asked about the different sorts of room, and asked about that particular room. She told me that was a 'basic room; small, dark and poky, with no view'. The words of a staff member, not me!

"“Pleasant experience” It was my first time visiting New York, and we'd utilized the customer reviews of various hotels prior to booking. We were prepared for the (small) size of the room, and were thrilled with the cleanliness, security and other amenities...(the fitness center was a great bonus; fully equipped, good environs).
The hotel's location is another positive feature.. walking distance to many of the attractions, if we didn't feel like taking the subway.. reasonably priced..
In our humble opinion, the hotel and its staff added to our pleasant stay...
If I make it back on another short trip, I'd definitely return to the New Yorker",janfrea,2010-07-01,122005,2010-08-08,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great room with a view & excellent location” We've been to New York before but this was our first time at the New Yorker and I would definitely go back. We requested a room with a view and were given a room on the 23rd floor with a brilliant view of the Hudson. Our room was modern and clean with plenty of room. The bathroom was clean, if not the most modern. Maid service was fantastic. All staff we dealt with were extremely friendly. Excellent air conditioning in the room which was a God send! Location is perfect - within walking distance to empire state and times square. Right across the road from Madison Square Gardens which was great for us as we went to a concert there. Also right beside Penn Station so could easily get underground to wherever we wanted to go.

"“Great Hotel, Perfect Location!!” I travelled to New York in May 2010 with my sister and friend, it was a surprise for my 30th Birthday!! On arrival we were quickly checked in and there was a bottle of bubbly, chocolates and balloons left in our room. The room was fairly small but i think that is to be expected when staying in a large city and it wasn't a problem to us as it had everything we needed. We even had a view of the Empire State Building from our room! The Hotel is in a perfect location just one block from Macys and a short walk from Times Square. The staff were very friendly and keen to answer any questions we had. The adjoining Tic Tock diner is a must visit, excellent breakfasts and great value! Also the open top bus tour was great, learnt so much about New York that i would never have know if it wasn't for the excellent tour guides on the bus! It was a fabulous surprise for my 30th birthday and i can't wait to go back again and i will definately stay at this Hotel again.",ChrisD23,2010-05-01,122005,2010-08-07,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Brilliant Location!!” I travelled to New York with my mum for a week! After a 7 hour flight, feeling very tired & hot we just wanted to be settled in our room. 
We were able to check in as soon as we arrived and the front desk staff were very friendly!!
After reading some reviews on this hotel i was worried what the rooms and staff were going to be like, we opened the bedroom door and what we saw was fantastic, had a view of Empire State Building. WOULD DEFFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!!! Had a great stay and would certaintly go back!!
We ate in the Tick Tock Diner & TGI Fridays across the road, read that these were expensive but i didnt find this.
Macys is one block away, a 5 minute walk & Times Square is 10 minute walk away.
Would recommend the bus tour as you see the whole of New York!!
Normally after a holiday you can't wait to get home to your own bed, however this was a different case the bed was soo comfy. The bathroom was a little undated but it did the job of what we needed and you do not need to take a hairdryer with you. 
Hotel is in great location, sad to be home :( but will deffinately use the same hotel on my next visit to New York!!",KatieG93,2010-07-01,122005,2010-08-06,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great location, smallest room ever” My partner and I just spent 5 days at the New Yorker in New York City. The trip was booked through Expedia.ca. The hotel was a great location but it was the smallest room you could ever imagine even for New York standards. You had to crawl over the bed to get in on one side and the bathroom could really be updated. It looked like circa 1970. I called the front desk to see if an upgrade was possible and the clerk said ""well lady you get what you pay for"". The staff on the front desk were the least helpful I have ever encountered.

"“Fantastic.” Stayed here for 7 nights in standard room - 2 double beds which were very comfy.
Staff were very helpful especially concierge - Suzy.
Room was cleaned and towels changed daily. Linen was changed once in the week. Ice machine on the floor was very handy as we were there in a heatwave. 
Tick Tock Diner was very good and food served quickly even when busy. Waiters were attentive and friendly.
Hotel is one block from Macy's and Empire State Building and 10 minutes from Times Square. 
Many restaurants in 9th Avenue worth a look. The Stage Door Restaurant opposite Madison Square Garden and one block form hotel is excellent value for money.
Would definitely recommend this hotel as a good base for a New York visit.",EMEdin,2010-07-01,122005,2010-08-03,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“This was one of our best experiences!!” We have just arrived back in the UK after 6 days in New York. The New Yorker hotel was fantastic. On our arrival we had a word with reception about trying to get a 'room with a view' . Mohammed, on the desk, was brilliant and gave exactly what we asked for. We had room 3517, the 35th floor and the view was awesome. We looked onto the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and loads of other skyscrapers. Our room looked down onto the street so you could see all the goings-on. The room was ample for us, two double beds, a chest of draws with a flat screen TV on top with loads of various channels including some pay per view films for both adults and kids. We hired a fridge for the duration of our stay which cost about $21 for 5 nights, a must as they don't provide coffee and tea making facilities.We took a travel kettle and some brew kit and as there was a pharmacy over the road we were able to get milk and drinks whenever we needed them. 
The room also had a walk in cupboard with ironing board and iron and a few hangers.
The bathroom had the most powerful shower and the bath was a sunken bath, perfect to relax in after a hard day pounding the streets.
The rooms have free wifi or you can pay for their premium service which costs about $10/day. 
The staff were always friendly and willing to help or answer questions. 
The hotel has a small gym (as if you are going to want to use it - lol!), a small business centre, a gift shop (which was not expensive as we thought it might be), and the Tick Tock Diner. The food in the diner was excellent and their portions massive, especially if you have their spag bol. I recommend the meat loaf and mash, well tasty. Some of the floors have vending machines with cold drinks.
Opposite the hotel is a TGI Fridays, which we didn't go to, a McDonalds, Burger King, Wendys and other fast food establishments as well as a restaurant straight over the road next to Madison Square Gardens, about 200 metres over the road. 
But as soon as you are out of the hotel, the world is your oyster, there are restaurants along every main avenue or side road, so there should be some kind of food to cater for everyone. Breakfast was different, i don't think the locals have heard of cereal and toast but they do like their eggs and bacon and pancakes etc so.... When in Rome.....
We also recommend purchasing the New York Pass. It will save you a lot of money in the long run and gives you the opportunity to use their fast track service. Go early if you want to see the Empire State Building, take sturdy shoes as you will probably do a lot of walking unless you can afford the taxi fares. Make sure you adhere to the pedestrian crossings as some New York drivers seem to ignore traffic lights and we saw a few 'near misses' when people decided to try crossing even when the pedestrian lights were still on red. Visit Maceys, Bloomingdales, do the TV and Movies tour, go to Grand Central Terminal and visit Juniors in the Dining area and have a real bit of New York cheesecake, to die for. 
Go to Central Park and visit the zoo, hire a bike or get someone to taxi you around or travel by horse and cart, visit the NYPD museum, take a ferry trip and see The Statue of Liberty.
And of course.... visit Times Square and have a ball!
Be prepared to pay London prices for most things as dining out is quite expensive, beer is not cheep and souvenirs are overpriced. That said, clothing is cheaper than the UK.
On your return (if you are travelling from JFK and British Airways), visit Terminal 4 as they have a lot more shops and places to eat, unlike Terminal 7 which is quite small in comparison. 
So in conclusion, the hotel was brilliant, and New York City rocks!",darksider1,2010-07-01,122005,2010-08-02,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“you get what you pay for” Stayed here for 4 nights - been to new york before and stayed in a few different hotels - unless you are willing to pay overf $200 a night then this is about as good as it will get - by UK standards this is about a 3 star hotel, little dated but very clean. Fantastic location which is probably the most important thing, after all you are not visiting new york to sit in the hotel room!! Small rooms, but very comfy bed and ok bathroom - again a little dated but you are not paying for 5 star accomodation. Staff are ok but not very friendly, this is typical of new york though. Tick Toc diner for breakfast is very good, and although some people say it is expensive you are eating in a city centre location!

"“Compact, OK location, but are there any better?” We stayed at The New Yorker Hotel for four nights arriving on 17th July. The location of the hotel is OK but in a slightly seedy part of 8th Ave. The rooms are typical NYC: compact with the bare essentials. I expected a room safe and there was none and same for a fridge which would have been useful during the heatwave of the east coast. The bed was comfortable and filled a lot of the room. The 'wardrobe' was not as deep as a clothes hanger but there were enough drawers. I would suggest bringing your own wash products as their's are not very nice.
Breakfast is good at the Tick Tock Diner. TIP: Shake Shack on 8th Ave and 43rd St is a good place to eat english-sized meals and delicious yoghurt ices. 
We did Top of the Rock instead of the Empire State- down side was that there weren't signs to show what many of the buildings were. TIP: Virgils on W44th nr Times Sq serves great southern ribs and burgers and Plataforma Churrascheria on W49th St nr 8th Ave was the best meal we had in 2 weeks if you are a carnivore - don't fill up on the starters though!
Don't miss Ellis Island, book online to skip the queue.
We also really enjoyed the USS Intrepid and found it all very interesting for about 3-4 hrs.
We went on to Boston by train so a short walk to the station was brilliant.",ruthiegee,2010-07-01,122005,2010-08-01,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“FANTASTIC STAY!” First trip to New York to celebrate my 40th birthday. Booked a package including flights and accommodation via Thomson Worldwide, and chose the New Yorker hotel as it was the cheapest central hotel (cheaper hotels are out by the airport). It more than lived up to expectation. I have worked in hotel's for the past 16 years, so can be a little critical when staying in other hotels. I couldn't fault the New Yorker. I emailed beforehand to let them know it was a special occasion and was delighted on arrival to find that they had upgraded us. Nice spacious rooms with views of The Empire State and my sisters room overlooked the Hudson. Housekeeping were excellent and our rooms were spotless, and cleaned in a timely manner every day. (We did leave a couple dollars tip every day, so don't know if that helped). I didn't have any trouble at all with the temperature in the shower - it was fine. The only noise I experienced was from the air conditioning unit, but had earplugs so really didn't bother me. The bed's are so comfortable and a warm welcome after walking so many miles every day!
We were warned about the price of food & drink before we went, but to be honest, we thought it was fine. Drink a bit more expensive than home (around $8 for a beer), but food was fine. We went to a local deli up the road for breakfast every day - around $17 for 4 of us, which is excellent value. We found a few places that had happy hour, so enjoyed a few cocktails! 
Had a fantastic meal in the Red Lobster, just on Times Square - it was the most expensive place we ate, but well worth it - the food was delicious. 
One tip - book the 72hour open bus tour ticket (you can find good deals online before you go). You get 4 different tours in different area's (Uptown, Midtown, Downtown and Night Tour). Got to see so much that we wouldn't have seen if we didn't book this.
The only negative thing I have to say about New York was how disappointed we were with the service in Bloomingdale's and Macy's. The girl in Macy's took a call from her mum whilst dealing with selling my sister a very expensive watch. Worse was Bloomies. The sales assistant there was on a personal call when we went to the cash desk. He continued his conversation with his friend whilst serving two of us - didn't speak to us apart from telling us how much we owed. I told his colleague how rude I thought it was, but they weren't really interested. Not what you would expect from such a prestigious establishment!
Loved New York - lived up to my expectations. The New Yorker was a great base for our 7 night stay and is so central (we were very embarassed when we got a taxi from the hotel to Times Square to find it was only a few blocks and we could have walked there in about 10 minutes!).",lma1970,2010-07-01,122005,2010-07-30,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location, small rooms, reasonable price... that about sums it up!” My fiance and I were going to New York for a short summer vacation and to see a Yankees game so I booked this hotel through the Priceline Negotiator. Since I had never heard of it I did some googling and checking of Yelp and Trip Advisor. The hotel is one with a rich history and still today has decent reviews. 
I don't have anything to say that will really change that. I certainly wasn't blown away but the hotel was perfectly adequate. The best thing about the hotel is probably the location. It is just down the street from Madison Square Garden/Penn Station, and within walking distance of almost anything you would want to see in NYC. Not to mention there was some great pizza and cheesecake right down the street! 
The lobby was large and somewhat outdated but I think it was meant to be. The elevators were a bit scary. The room was incredibly small, then again most New York rooms are, but it was clean and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was also small and maybe it was just me but I couldn't get the shower water to not be blazing hot! 
The attached Tick Tock Diner was... well ok is the best I can say for that place. Slow service and way overpriced but the food tasted alright and I did have a decent milkshake. 
Overall, if you book The New Yorker Hotel without crazy good expectations you will likely leave pleased.

"“Great location but don't expect luxury” Hotel appears tired and dated, and this is reflected in the lobby which bears little resemblance to the hotel's website photos. This clearly once was a ritzy place, but it now needs some modernising. The bar is hugely over-priced. Tick Tock Diner also over-priced but fine for emergency dining. Rooms are small, with tired decor, but they are extremely clean and comfortable, with modern linens and multi-channel flat screen tvs. Bathroom was very clean but somewhat scruffy. Free Wifi in the room. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. There are no safes in the rooms but safety deposit boxes are provided at reception. The location of the hotel more than compensates for its dated feel. It's just five minutes to Macys, Madison Square Gardens, Broadway and the Empire State. There is a handy Starbucks across the street and lots of good places to eat close by. Also Duane Reade stores (several on Broadway) sell beer and sandwiches and snacks.

Room was a large ""double double"",with a big walk in closet complete with iron and ironing board, 3 windows in the bedroom,2 of which only faced onto another part of the hotel,but the 3 rd window had a nice view of penn station over to Madison square garden and the city life below(we were on the 29th floor),Large flat screen Tv in the room too.Beds were very very comfy,with lovely crisp fresh sheets,air conditioning was fantastic tho a little noisy at night,but there was no noise from the corridors etc at night,Room appeared to be quite well insulated from noise(including the sound of the city )
Bathroom was more than adequate,with a fantastic shower,a short but very deep bath,and a fitted hairdryer.and a complimentary starter pack of soap,bath gel,shower cap etc.
Lift was quick,smooth and silent,with added security of having to show your room key before being allowed access to the lift area.
Lobby was very spacious,quiet and relaxing with a small vendor area selling tea/coffee/soft drinks,cookies,muffins etc.only problem here was,as a family of 3,it was difficult to find 3 seats together on the rare occassions we sat to ""chill out"" for 10mins,some extra seating would be helpfull.
Staff were always,friendly,approachable and obliging.
Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel was reasonable value,meals were large and tasty,breakfast was huge and we found when we had breakfast here we never needed a lunch(might be something to do with the fact that all egg based breakfasts also come with cooked potatoes and toast.),service here was always pleasant and quick.Theres a Coopers Tavern too,but we didnt go in there.
Housekeeping was very good,fresh towels in the bathroom every day,bins emptied,rooms hoovered,beds made up with lovely fresh crisp sheets every day on our return from sightseeing etc.
Check out is simple,-pop keycard in a box in lobby,Bellboys will take luggage into storage for only 1 dollar per case,and then return luggage and hail you a taxi if required when leaving.
I had to request a refrigerator to store medical injections during my stay and the hotel very kindly supplied one for the full week,free of charge,
My O.H and 12yr old daughter used the fitness center(free),both said it was well equipted.
Theres a buisness centre too,but we didnt use this.
Telephones downstairs were plentifull and a 3min phonecall to the UK cost 1 dollar.Gift shop downstatirs is handy for little souveniers such as New York key rings/pens/pencil etc at only 1 Dollar,more expensive stuff too,bags,Tshirts,sweaters etc.
There were areas of the Hotel that we didnt investigate,2 floors(possibly more)had Icecube machines and soda machines,Dunno how much these cost,If we return we may investigate the actual hotel more fully.
Location wise its perfect,5min walk to Macy's,10/15 min to Empire state building,20/25 min to Broadway/Times square,Subway is fantastic and there is a stop right at the side of the hotel.
Theres a McDonalds,Starbucks,Burger king and TGI Fridays accross from the Hotel,and a large Pharmacy (Duane Reade...they are EveryWhere in NYC!)selling typical chemist type stuff,plus drinks,snacks,filled sandwiches,sweets etc,theres a vendor selling bagels with cream cheese($1)massive pretzels,hotdogs,soft drinks etc,right at the corner of the hotel.
Value wise,im not actualy sure how much we paid for the hotel alone as we booked it as a ""package holiday"",but I do know it came up cheapest when searching ThomsonTailormade site.
Taxi from JFK took around 1hr at night(may have been a bit less,we didnt pay much attention),However,The return journey was during ""Rush hour"" and took,much much longer,we got to the airport with only 20mins to spare(phew)Thankfully the Bellboy had got us a very experienced driver who got us there on time,,just something to be aware of if you are leaving and arriving at different times,transfer times from hotel to airport will vary greatly.

"“good location , decent value” stayed here for 3 nights at New Year from December 31st to January 3rd . Purpose of trip mainly to get engaged / buy an engagement ring in new york. because of time of year and my late booking of trip hotels were very expensive and few and far between. originally booked something else with the idea of checking hotwire and priceline just before leaving. this showed up for £400 for 3 nights so i took it .
hotel was good, nice downstairs , free wifi as well in rooms.
probably got a room at back because i was hotwire booking , definately try and get a room looking onto empire state building.",robertadams,2010-01-01,122005,2010-07-14,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Value for money! Great location!” Stayed here over Christmas and and New Year. No festive spirit at this hotel. A christmas tree in the foyer that's about it! Great location - 10 minutes walk to Times Square and underground on the corner. Good value for money. Paid about £90 per night for room only which was relatively cheap considering the expensive hotel prices in New York. We didn't have a great holiday as the weather delayed our flights and Air France lost our luggage - not good over Christmas as we got it back the day we were coming home (and AF couldn't be contacted easily due to the holidays). We were happy in our room on the 19th floor but found a live mouse outside our room door on the second day. The hotel manager moved us to a different floor (and a small suite room) - although we preferred the double room we had initially. We were also offered a free breakfast for the next morning and offered a private car to the airport at the end of our stay. We were not too upset about the mouse as it is an old hotel and we were happy enough with the manager's offerings. Restaurant attached to side of hotel was very busy and not very pleasant. Lots of staff but they were very rushed. Very expensive for what you got. Overall I would probably stay at this hotel again as I thought it was value for money.,hayley101,2009-12-01,122005,2010-07-13,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Only good thing about this hotel was the location” For the same price I’m sure you can find a better hotel than this one.
The only good thing was the location - its spot on with only a few steps away from Macy’s dept store and the Subway station is literally right next door.
The Lobby is nicely decorated but the rooms aren’t anything special for the price you pay – pretty basic and standard. 
The light in the bathroom went when my brother was in the shower so he and the rest of us had showers in the dark. We had to call the lobby twice in order for someone to be sent to fix the problem. In the end we just left as all the waiting around was eating into our sightseeing and shopping time. It got fixed in the end bit was annoying.
Avoid the Diner on the corner – food is rubbish.
Starbucks opposite the hotel was a god send...we had breakfast where every day before head out on our daily tours.
Overall – first impressions where good but went downhill and fast. Wouldn’t stay here and wouldn’t recommend to a friend either.",Knowledgeable_One,2009-10-01,122005,2010-07-12,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“I love this hotel” We stayed here before, but this time we brought the kids as well and stayed 4 nights. The location is perfect, next to Penn Station, great connection to the airport as well as the subway system to get around in NY.
The room wasn't too big and the view could be better, but hey that's not the reason why you're in Manhattan. The room was clean, the bed was confi and there was a flatscreen. There's also free wifi in the room. 
The first morning we had breakfast in the TikTok Diner, but it's not as good anymore as it used to be. Burned toast, poor service etc... The rest of our stay we had breakfast around the corner on 34th Str direction 9th Ave, self service but very good quality at reasonable prices.

"“Great location but a few let downs” we arrived at the New Yorker Hotel after travelling 18 hours from Sydney. My partner and I had paid for a ""deluxe city view room"" so upon checking in we were quite upset to see that our city view was in fact a view into someone's office about 1 metre away, and the deluxe room was not so deluxe. in fact, there were no working power points in the room, and I have no idea how the hotel expected 2 people plus luggage to fit into the space. I know that NYC rooms are small, but this was ridiculous. we couldn't even walk past the edge of the bed.
My partner phoned reception and explained that this was not good enough - we were here for 9 nights, had travelled 18 hours to get to NYC, plus I was spending my birthday here and he wanted it to be special. I could understand if they gave this room to a local staying for 1 night on business, but not to overseas guests for 9 nights. They explained that they could change our room in the morning and we were happy with this result.
The next day we changed rooms and were very happy with the outcome. It was actually what we had paid for! Great views of Empire State and Madison Square Garden.
After this incident though I felt that Reception staff were rude to us (because we complained?) and weren't very keen at all to make our stay enjoyable. The lady at Concierge was generally helpful but would sometimes let out a frustrated noise when asked to do something that she may have felt was too hard. The diner was great value and you could easily have breakfast in there without needing lunch as well, the meals were huge.
Great location for first time visitors to NYC but unfortunately don't think I'd stay again after a few not-so-good experiences during our stay.",Melie6,2010-06-01,122005,2010-07-11,False,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.1,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Excellent hotel, great location!” I stayed at The New Yorker from 29th June till 8th July for 9 nights, as a solo traveller. Check-in was quick, as there was no queue, and I was given a Metro room on the 35th floor. 
As per previous reviews, and my pictures, the room was a decent size for central Manhattan. It was big enough for me and I had no problems with it. A couple could easily use this size of room and have no problems either. The view from the window was a bonus, as I'd been expecting a room on the lower floors with hardly any view over the city. So I was pleasantly surprised to get such a good room that overlooked 8th Ave and 34th st. My view consisted of Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and downtown Manhattan. It was really appreciated!
* The cleaning staff were great and left my room spotless everyday. I left a tip of $2 per day for them.
* The 24 hour Tik Tok Diner was really good, with great service and food. The evening waiter (stocky asian guy with a nicely trimmed beard and a slight mohican haircut) was especially good at his job and rarely left me waiting. I always tipped $5 when I paid for my meals. I normally spent $15-20 on my food with the tip on top. I can recommend the Breakfast Burritto with chocolate shake :) You can order stuff to take out to your room if you want to.
* The front desk were professional and polite, as were the other desks when approached.
* Security was good to see. They guarded the lift area, so you had to display your room key before they let you past.
* There are soda and ice vending machines located on the higher floors, which was very handy. I felt there should've been a machine for snacks as well, but now I'm being picky!
* The shop in the basement was good, with decent gifts at reasonable prices. Of course you can buy your postcards and stamps there. The mailbox is in the main lobby.
* A hairdryer, iron and ironing board were also in the room. I believe a kettle could be asked for if needed. I brought my own anyway. 
* Having Madison Square Garden across the road was great, as I went to a concert. Very handy for just rolling out of bed after a quick siesta and heading on over to.
* Penn Station was very handy to be near by, not just for the ""1"" train downtown, but also for the ""E"" train to JFK. All areas of Manhattan are accessable via this station.
Overall, my stay was excellent and I'd happily stay here again in future. I paid roughly £90 per night, when I booked my trip via Expedia, which I felt was very cheap considering the hotel's reputation and midtown location. As with any hotel worldwide, sometimes you can get noisy guests and/or cleaners.. but just bring some earplugs if you're a light sleeper! 
I'd totally recommend this hotel to anybody visiting New York City.",Davey1800,2010-07-01,122005,2010-07-10,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location” Hi everyone, myself and my husband stayed here on our honeymoon in April 2010. We immediately liked its location(beside penn station, madison square garden and other subway links). We also loved the look of the hotel. On our check in they didnt advise us that they would be taking money off our CC for ""incidentals"" so we got a shock when we viewed or CC acc online. When I asked at reception the person told me ""incedentals"" but I came away no better so went to another member of staff and they explained. We didnt know the system but if you are taking money from someones CC it should be explained what it is for. Anyway are room was lovely and the bathroom was small but functional. Our turn down/accommodation service was brilliant. We had a view of Madison Sq Gardens (brill). We ate breakfast and a couple of meals in the Tick Tock Diner, the food is lovely but the staff were most of the time not ""present"" especially one of the older men.....he most of the time was too busy chatting to his co-workers.
Overall I really liked this hotel and it was much fancier than the Comfort Inn I stayed in on 25th Street but the staff in the Comfort were much nicer.",louloum84,2010-04-01,122005,2010-07-09,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Friendliest staff we have ever encountered!!!” I was in NYC with my family for 5 nights for a dance competition at the Manhattan Center around the corner from the hotel. Our wonderful experience started with check in at 11:30 when our room was ready for us. Great view of the Empire State Building on the 22nd floor.
After we got settled in our room, our 10 and 14 year old daughters wanted to watch a little TV before we were off to the King Tut exhibit. The TV did not work - but not for long. We called the front desk and within 5 minutes two maintenance men arrived in our room and quickly solved the minor plug problem. They were friendly and polite and wished us a nice stay. Later that night the hairdryer did not work. Again, within 10 minutes another exceptionally friendly person arrived at our room and quickly replaced the wall unit. 
We requested an extra blanket and extra pillows on the first night of our stay. They were brought to our room within 10 minutes. 
The housekeeping staff were excellent! I can't say enough about them. They were always friendly to my husband and I and our girls. One noticed that my daughter had her dance costume on and wished her luck! The room was spotless when we returned to our room late in the afternoon. I called the housekeeping manager the day before we checked out and let him know how terrific his staff was during our stay. He was very appreciative. I bet he was fully prepared to hear a complaint!
We did not eat at the Tick Tock diner. We did have desert at the restaurant downstairs. Very nice - good experience. Reasonable, clean and good cheesecake. 
I felt very safe in the hotel. They have security near the elevators to the rooms.

NY Penn station is around the corner (you can take the train from Newark airport right to NY Penn station for about $15 - takes about 30 minutes). You can walk to Times Square, Hells Kitchen, Empire States Building, Macy's, etc. easily! The area seemed safe and there is a diner (tick tock diner) connected to the hotel that is open all the time.
The room itself is small - pretty much just your bed and a small bathroom. Having said that, it's clean and comfortable. I would stay here again. There is a business center in the basement where you can print off boarding passes for free, and there is a gym.",fayesuave,2010-06-01,122005,2010-07-08,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Seriously the hotel MADE my trip! (:” When we arrived at the hotel around four o'clock, there was no que to check in, and we were served by a wonderful man named Angel on the front desk. Oh and how he was. After he talked us through the basic facts on staying in the hotel (charges etc) my sister asked if it was possible for us to have a city view. Angel said that we didn't currently have one, but he could check and it turned of there was. We had a lovely chat to him about America, and I generally said how it was my first time in the USA, so he said as a kind gesture for my first stay he would bump up our room free of charge. Which was wonderful to hear after a long flight. Though he warned that the room wouldn't be large.
Oh but it was, the room was clean (throughout the stay), was new and very art deco. And the view seriously was amazing especially if you woke up a night. The beds were spacious and the pillows were divine. I could go on and on. But another main fact was that the hotel felt completely safe,and it was natural to be able to return at two in the morning go to the fabulous (and so friendly!) diner then go to your room safely. The cleaning staff were always pleasant saying hello first, and I dot understand people who moan about there being no coffee or tea making facilities when there was vending and ice machines on the 33rd floor. Anyway I loved this hotel and would recommend it to everyone! I have even since emailed the hotel and they're going to sell me some of those amazing pillows! Now that's service.

We were given a nice room up on 36th floor with great views to the north, the room was a decent size and everything looked new and worked perfectly, bed was made and fresh towels were on hand everyday.
The aircon was a little rattly and the walls are pretty thin, so don't expect uninterupted sleep, I survive on little sleep anyway. The gym is very good for an early morning blast.
The staff were generally quite helpful and pleasant as can be expected for a large hotel, but nothing to write home about. The safety deposit boxes are quite useful and are located at reception.
We didn't sample the food in the bar, but the bar tender was very friendly. The Tick tock diner is nothing to get too excited about. The Starlight diner just up the road is a bit friendlier and where the locals go.
The hotel is ideally located for Times Square/Empire State/Shopping, but the area is very busy and noisy and isn't the nicest part of NYC to stop if you want a quieter life, look elsewhere.

Hotel phoned the week before to explain what I had done and asked if it was ok to refund me upon my visit. it was done instantly when I visited the transport desk the next morning even had birthday wishes from the staff.
Room small but at the end of the day you only sleep, shower and change in it. It was very clean and I loved the art deco features thoughout the hotel, even in the bathroom. My husband brought me flowers and within 30 minutes of asking for a vase room service delivered it.
The diner attached to the hotel was fab, food and service good. The only down side was that even though the safety boxes were free, they were in reception and you had to queue with everyone else to get access and sometimes it was a little long if there was a lot of people checking in.
Location fab just by the empire state building, Macy's and Maddison Square Gardens all well worth seeing. Central to everything in the city, Times Square around 5-10 minutes walk.

On previous stays I have always had two double beds so I am not sure if I got a different room type but the one bedroom rooms are very small and uncomfortable and if you wanted tea or coffee you had to ask housekeeping to bring you a machine and coffee rather than it just being in the room anyway. The location is great for the hotel and when in new york your not in your room anyway so I suppose its no big deal about the room size it was more the staff issue that put me off.,bowseywowsey,2010-06-01,122005,2010-06-29,False,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.9,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Lovingly Restored Art Deco Hotel” I didn't give this hotel five stars for its opulence or gourmet dining, but because it's such an exellent value for the money. For starters, the New Yorker is in a great location. The Empire State Building is just up the street, along with Macy's and plenty of nice restaurants. The ever-present Starbucks is across the street, alongside McDonald's. Times Square is within a short walk. Best of all, the subway stop for the A,C, and E trains is right next to the hotel, so you can whisk all over the city within minutes. The room was small, sure (I prefer to call it ""cozy""), but mine was on a corner with two windows and a nice view of the Hudson River peeking between buildings. The bathroom had a big tub, but if you like a really hot bath/shower, the water never gets super hot (I believe this is part of the hotel's ""green"" thinking) - though it is perfectly comfortable for bathing. The bed was firm and comfy, and the sheets were to die for. I thought the service was excellent - there were friendly smiles everywhere, and the staff was very helpful. The TickTock diner is cute, with excellent breakfasts. Coopers Tavern was just okay. The only possible downside here is one found at many hotels - the hallways can be noisy because the room doors are the slam shut/lock tight kind, and late-night arrivals might disrupt your sleep, though I was always so tired from all the sightseeing I had no trouble sleeping! All in all, I enjoyed my stay at this historic hotel.",emmi331,2010-06-01,122005,2010-06-27,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great place to stay” Booked this hotel through Priceline and was very happy with the results. The rooms (we had 3 with family) seemed very spacious for NYC.

"“Great location, poor welcome.” We got a great deal on this hotel, and it came recommended by the travel agent. While the location is excellent as advised, the initial feeling on arrival at the hotel was not a good one, as none of the staff are particularly forthcoming when it comes to welcoming you and helping you check in.
I thought that this might be a one-off, as previous visits to the USA have always left a lasting impression in terms of excellent service, but unfortunately the staff throughout the stay were consistently rude and unhelpful, from the reception staff abruptly telling me I couldn't upgrade my room or have a late check out without a high additional charge, to the concierge closing his desk 10 minutes early and telling us when we arrived that ""you'll have to speak to somebody in the morning, but you're looking at $180 dollars upwards for tickets to see Chicago"". Luckily, we realised that this was just another example of them presenting us with an inflated cost in order to discourage us from making a booking and therefore creating more work for them. When booking at the theatre box office, we managed to get tickets for $60.
Our room was extremely small and badly laid out, resulting in me knocking my legs against various pieces of furniture time and time again, and our view was most un-inspiring - a large apartment block was opposite us.
On the plus side, the bed was very comfortable, and the Tick Tock Diner served great breakfasts, if a little pricey.
I'm planning on returning to New York but would think about booking here again. I would hope that there are many other hotels in the city that employ staff that are happy to help and can crack the odd smile here and there.",DarlingtonFizz,2010-06-01,122005,2010-06-25,False,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Convenient location.” As others have said, this is a very convenient location. As a result of this, the area is very busy (verging on manic). The subway is right across the street or around the corner, depending in which direction you wish to travel. Drug store, 24 hour Macdonald's and 24 hour diner (quite expensive) all on the door step. Right across from Madison Square Gardens and around the corner from Macey's. Oh and avoid TGI Fridays (right across the street), it is absolutely filthy - expecially the toilets. The rooms were small, but clean and adequate and the beds were comfortable. We also got quite a good rate. Our visit to this hotel was marred by the very pushy and rude bell boy, who took exception to us booking our own taxi when departing for the airport. He obviously had some kind of arrangement with certain taxi drivers who charge around $20 more than we managed to agree with an independant taxi driver. This made him very sore when we told him that we didn't want a taxi, but then went to the driver we had actually booked. He came over and gave us a mouthful of abuse, obviously sore that he would be losing out on his cut of the money. I will be making a complaint to the hotel about this awful man. Surely it is up to us where and when we spend our money; do not be intimidated in to booking the cab that they have arrangements with. For the record, if you book a private car with the transportation people (also very pushy) within the hotel it is $85 dollars to Newark Airport including taxes and tolls (but not the tip). If you arrange a taxi with the bell boy, it will be around $90 (obviously to cover his and the taxi driver's cut of the extra). With the independent taxi drivers the same trip will be $70 including taxes and tolls, the tip is extra. Our taxi driver was fully registered, he just didn't have the arrangement with the bell boys. He was also one of the more polite people that we came across in New York City, and one of the few people who deserved our tip. All in all a decent hotel, but certain staff seriously need to take a course in etiquette and customer service.",sunshine19,2010-06-01,122005,2010-06-24,False,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The attached diner was alright for diner food. Chef Yu's right down the street was defintely a better treat.

"“Ok, but disappointing for a seasoned traveler.” Check in: confronted with a clerk who clearly could not care less, got to our room- a SINGLE. For 2 people with a weeks reservation! And we paid PREMIUM prices. Nope, went back down to the desk, stated our case, the first clerk told us this was the room grade for 1-800-hotels.com guests. Fortunately, Mohammed was able to find us a slightly larger room, and KEPT apologizing about the lack of view! I just was happy to be able to get to the bathroom without tripping over my spouse. So, room amenities were fine. The problem came in the bar. When we asked for a rocks glass & a wine glass for the room, we were told that the bar was separate from the hotel, and could not accomadate us. So why could I charge my bar tab to my room? Just don't LIE to your customers in hope of one more round. Believe me, we found a place that sold glasses so we could have a quiet drink in our room! And we spent plenty in that bar anyway, so why unsult us of by being greedy? 
I have to complain about one blond bartender on our Friday night who was so rude as to be deservedly fired. She was so busy chatting up some lawyer type that she got completely snooty when an Irish patron asked her to repour his beer with a proper head; and an Englishman who rightly complained when she poured him bourbon instead of the Scotch he requested.

"“Brilliant Hotel - great location!” The hotel is lovely! 
Room is comfortable and clean, bathroom is small (but you don't spend your vacation in there anyways!). 
Staff were very friendly and accommodating. They didn't have the room we booked when we arrived, so they gave us a little upgrade. 
They have a diner attached to the hotel. Tick Tock Diner.
It's super cheap and food is good and plentiful. If you like big portions - then this if the place to go!
We hired a fridge for our stay - $20. Great for keeping water in the room. And with a 24hr pharmacy over the road, there was always cheap snacks and drinks to hand. Starbucks, 24hr McDonalds and TGI Fridays just over the road.
Less than 10 minutes walk from Times Square, 15 mins walk to Central Park.
Underground stations everywhere - at the corner of the hotel and along the road from Penn Station.
Loved this hotel. Would definately visit again!",huntress-on-tour,2010-02-01,122005,2010-06-22,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location, decent rooms but looking rather tired.” Stayed a few nights in a Tower suite. They have a warped definition of ""suite"", Ive been in rooms larger than the so called suite - theyve basically shoved a wall in the middle of a room and whacked in an extra tv and called it a suite, after cutting the size of the bathroom in half. The bathroom was tiny, and the toilet was kid-sized and placed far too close to the wall. Water pressure was weak too. The bed was comfy and there's a good selection of channels with the flatscreen tvs. Rather noisy air-con and lack of a sound system and dvd was disappointing. Nice view though from the higher floors. Continental breakfast in the small lounge on the 39th floor was average in selection but good in quality. It was included in the rate but reception never bothered to explain anything and I stumbled there by chance. In fact service is non-existent. Had a problem with the plumbing and left about 4 messages (no one answers the phone) for housekeeping and even the manager and nothing happened for hours till I actually talked to reception downstairs. 
This is a big hotel and the small lobby gets pretty crowded thanks to the high guest turnover. There's a security guard randomly checking guest for keys before they hit the elevators but the sheer number of guests makes this useless exercise little more than window dressing. Theres also a small fitness centre with limited equipment. Dont expect help with your luggage and you wont be disappointed, but the lone doorman did a great job given the circumstances. The room and common areas are showing their age; not tattered and torn but reflective of a slightly run down 3 star hotel at best, except you are paying 4-5 star prices here, even for NY.
The location was great, right in the midst of mid town manhattan, a stroll to Times Square, Madison Square Garden and Macy's. The room was rather basic, clean but nothing special - you're paying for the location but at these prices there are better alternatives nearby. Plenty of punters think otherwise, judging by the volume of guests pouring in and out of the hotel. It's the new yorker venue in every sense, an overpriced tourist trap.",FatcatJunketeer,2010-06-01,122005,2010-06-22,False,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good value” We stayed at the New Yorker for four nights during June 2010.
We found the hotel quite good: the location is cracking with Penn Station very close and Times Square in less than 15 minutes walk.
If you like shopping then the biggest Macy's store in New York is in walking distance.
The room was a bit on the small side but the bed was really comfortable plus it's New York and we were always out so we did not mind the room size.
Tick Tock diner cafe was really good and their blueberry pancakes at morning are a must.",nicolaperrozzi,2010-06-01,122005,2010-06-21,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Enjoyable stay” My family and I stayed at this hotel for seven nights in November '09. The location of the hotel is very good, opposite Penn Station, just down from The Empire State Building and right next to Madison Square Garden, we had no problems finding our way around and getting to all the sites/locations that we wanted to see. Check in was quick and easy, we had to extend our stay as our flights had been changed and therefore had two bookings for the hotel, we requested when we checked in to stay in the same room for the second half of the booking which was granted with no problems. Our room was clean and of a reasonable size, others have said that the rooms were small but we found them plenty big enough for us, my only gripe would be that me and my husband had to share a double bed and we usually have a king, so it was a bit of a squeeze, but my husband seemed to have no problems with this judging from the snoring! The bathroom was fine and the shower was a good size. Maid service was also fine. Security were efficient, we had opened our room door and then left it on the latch while we went back into the room to get something, after about five minutes security had come to the door to see why it had been left open. We ate at the TickTock diner everyday for breakfast which is located in the hotel and can be accessed via the lobby, this was for convenience more then anything the food was edible but have had better at Ihop.

"“New Yorker.. Thank you for making NYC so great.” I just got back from this hotel.. And I have to admit that it was best stays ever. I had some issues at the beginning. I hate to used credit cards and I called the hotel the day before to ask if I needed one. I was told no so I didn't even bother to reload my prepaid one. When I got to the hotel they told me I had to have one... They were nice enough to hold my stuff while I ran around looking for a green dot location. We found out there was one eight blocks down, went down there and they were sold out. The only place in the city that sold them and they were out. Thankfully the staff at the New Yorker was amazing and helped us get a room. Because of everything that happened they even upgraded us to a better room. The room was amazing. It was the perfect location. Right across from Madison Square Garden (we came in for a wrestling show from PA). I can't tell you how greatful I was to the staff. It was everything I could have ever asked for (for the first time staying overnight in NYC) and so much more.

"“What can i say?...........” Stayed at The New Yorker from the 9th June to the 14th June. Our first impressions of the actual hotel were amazing but after facing the miserable cretin on the desk, our thoughts were turned upside down. He was apparently the Night Manager. We had just arrived off a flight from Los Angeles so we were absolutey shattered. When we approached the desk, he DEMANDED a credit card and immediatley tried to take money off of it. He didnt explain to us what he was doing. When he couldnt get $270 off it, he DEMANDED another one. When we questioned what he was doing, he replied ""incidentals, incase YOU smoke in the room"". When we replied that we dont smoke, he basically said he didnt care and he wanted the money. 
We told him we didnt have that much on the card, then he THREW the card back at us and said ""Im not checking you in then!"" Eventually we had to give him $300 cash. When he recieved it, he was like a kid in a sweet shop. He was so happy! Prat. The hotel was also told that it was my partners 30th birthday but we were on the 25th floor with a view of other peoples rooms and the room was quite 'compact'.
All in all, it was a really nice hotel within a good area, easy access to the Subway. But some of the staff need training. Obviously, the higher your floor, the quieter it is.

On one hand, we had the most breathtaking view from our room (on the 32nd floor), the room was spacious and the beds were big and comfortable. BUT... upon arrival, I was shocked by one of the staff members. She was on the phone when I waited to check in and was CLEARLY annoyed by the guest she was talking to, who had a request. She was rolling her eyes and acting out, and not only did I think she was rude to the guest, but shouldn't she at least try to act professional in front of us others as well?

My friend and I were staying there for 8 nights and we both had large suitcases. The room we were given was extremely small, there was just about room to wheel our suitcases in but no where to unpack for the both of us. We went back down to reception to see if we could change our room. On this occassion we spoke with a lady called Rayvonne. She was extremely polite and helpful. She gave us a much larger room with two bathrooms and was ideal for us.

"“New Yorker Hotel- mostly good, beware the attitude problem receptionist” Stayed in the New Yorker for our first ever visit to NYC this month.

In all fairness to the rest of the staff and the hotel, we could only fault this person. Everyone else we dealt with was great especially the staff of tick tock diner. Security is excellent.

“New Yorker hotel good base for a holiday” Stayed at the hotel at the end of May for 5 nights. Basic rooms are small . We were upgraded as this was our first visit to New York and wanted a room with a view . Staff on the reception desk were friendly and polite despite being constantly busy. The room upgrade made the holiday stay more comfortable and with a view of the Hudson river.

"“Excellent location” My husband and I stayed with The New Yorker for 5 nights late June. We requested a quiet room away from the lifts and got exactly what we asked for with views of the Hudson River. Our room was whisper quiet and when I asked for a Coffee machine, it was promptly sent up without question. Concierge always appeared in high demand, so we tended to ask the information/transport desk staff when needing directions etc.
Yes there were a lot of homeless people/beggars on all the streets of Manhatten, and having Penn Station subway just out the door, meant there were quite a few just outside the front of the hotel. With views of the Empire State Building and the mass of humanity, depending which direction your room was facing, if you want to be in the centre of the action, you could not ask for a better location. However, Manhatten seems to work like a well oiled machine considering the hoards of people on the sidewalk at any time of the night or day, so it pays to wear excellent walking shoes and watch where you are walking at all times (so you dont slip on the sidewalk cracks/potholes). We found the chinese laundry down a side alley at rear of hotel a real find for doing your washing from wo to go for $6. Tick Toc Diner was great the second visit, however on our first visit on a Sunday morning, it was clearly packed to the rafters and the serving staff were run off their feet. It took several requests for that second cup of tea. Would I stay @ The New Yorker again, most definitely if I were younger and wanting to see all the sights - as its location is faultless. However, I would want a bar fridge or some form of refrigeration so I could at least drink my coffee/tea with real milk in my room.

"“Plain & Overpriced” I have been traveling to New York on business for several years and the city has got to a point of being insanely ridiculous with hotel prices and what one receives for the price. There is not any excuse this hotel staff or anyone in NY can give me for this blatant ripoff that would make any sense. This hotel offers rooms that are not small but tiny, my room barely had room for the bed. If you are a fan of art noveau, you'll love this place as it is decorated throughout in that style. The staff is very good and security does a great job making sure only guests get on the elevators. They do a brisk business as was evident by the crowded lobby and people lined up to check-in and out. The best part of the hotel is the diner next door. The worst part was the $626.00 hold they placed on my credit card when I checked in. Some hotels do this with all their guests to protect themselves in case a guest damages the room. However, for a 2-3 star property like this, I found that exccessive and for that reason will not stay here again.",biztraveler22,2010-06-01,122005,2010-06-11,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Everything we needed.” Stayed here for 5 days at the beginning of June. Having read trip advisor the Hotel was just as I expected. Location is really second to none, we flew into Newark and an easy 25 minute train ride costing just $15 took us to Penn station, right across the street from the New Yorker. It was only lunchtime but we checked straight in, with no wait, to our room on the 36th floor with amazing views (Could see Liberty from our bed!). Yes the rooms are not huge, but they are spotlessly clean with a really comfortable bed, LCD T.V. and Air conditioning what more do you need? Security is good, you cannot use the Lifts until you show your room keycard. After dumping our bags we walked to central Park, it was gloriously hot, and the way the ""blocks"" are set out it's quite simple to find your way around. Whoever said it's not near Times square must be incredibly lazy its a 10 minute walk max. There's plenty of shops, bars etc. in the area, we did use the Tick Tock Diner but there is better just up the road. As for Coopers Tavern $11 for a JD & Coke!!. The concierge in the hotel is very helpful , do visit if only for the 10% off at Macys voucher. 
 We didn't use the buses but Penn Station over the road is very handy for the subway, which we took to Ground Zero, its only $2 per trip however far you go. Everyone is very helpful, they can't do enough for you and we would absolutely choose to stay at the New Yorker again.

"“City of Blinding lights” The New Yorker Hotel is in a great location, just opposite Madison Square Gardens and a small stroll away from Macy's and the Empire State Building. There are 3 subways near by. A 10 minute walk from Times Square. It was our anniversary and the hotel kindly put us in a room with a view of the Empire State fantastic. The room was clean and the lobby looked great with it's marble, bell hops and art decco. security was tight which was reassuring although I never felt threatened once in the City. We used the Tick Tock diner once which was a little disappointing compared to others we ate at although it was always full and busy. The Bar was o.k but very expensive 9 dollars for a glass of wine. The hotel met my expectations and I would use again.

Although the room was on the small side (what we expected of rooms in New York) the location and obviously the view from our room made up for this.

"“Great Location but noisy and tiny rooms” One thing you cant fault this hotel on is its location. It is on the same street as Macy's and the Empire State Building, opposite Madison Square Gardens and just 7 blocks from Tmes Square. Opposite is a local chemist/convenience store which is very useful for picking up bottles of drink or any last minute toiletries (as rooms to not have drink making facilities). The tick tock diner attached to the Hotel was nice but was a little pricey and the service was not fantatic. 
One big fault however was the size of the rooms and noise levels. The sound of the next room flushing their toilet was so loud it felt like it was in the same room as us and even though we were on the 29th floor we could still hear the street outside. The rooms were very small, there was about 2 feet of room around 2 sides of the bed and the toilet was about 6 foot from the bed on the other side. WIth 2 suitcases and 2 hand luggage bags on the floor there was alot of climbing over things. 
We were given a free upgrade from a Metro Room to a View Room (due to early check in which they happily accommodated) but the view was mainly of the hotel on the otherside of the road and not of Manhattan. We would have been very dissapointed if we had paid for a View Room. 
If like us you are going to sightsee and will just be sleeping in the hotel rather than spending any considerable time there then it is an adequate hotel.",SightseeLDN,2010-05-01,122005,2010-05-30,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

the tick tock diner which is attached to the hotel had a good range of food at a very good price

"“Clean comfortable stay in central location near everything in NYC” In summary we enjoyed our stay at the New Yorker Hotel. Room was very small and limited cupboard space to put clothes for 2 persons but overall a very modern room and extremely comfortable bed with high quality bedding. We heard no one's voices in neighbouring rooms only heard people in hallway as they passed the room but no big deal. Nice flat screen TV on wall mounted in front of bed made nighttime watching TV comfortable. We opened the window on our 23rd floor room to get breeze rather than running AC all the time. Bathroom very small with very little space to leave toiletries but overall everything was operational with good shower pressure albeit the temperature never got too hot so I just ran the hot water which was warm enough for our showers. Nice towels and replenished soaps, lotions, shampoos mid way through our stay. Location of hotel is just around corner of the 34th St./Penn Station Subway stop and across road from Pennsylvania Main Rail station. Macy's is 2 large blocks away and Empire state Building is 3 large blocks away but all walkable. We walked lots and lots and used the 1 week Metro pass costing just $27 which was a great value. Times Square is 1 metro stop away and was awesome too. The Tick Tock Diner is located directly next door to hotel which was a great diner to catch daily breakfasts and lunches at and they are open 24 hours/day. Hotel doesn't offer room service but most local restaurants will deliver to your room if you want to stay in now and again. I do recommend the New Yorker as I do think it offers good value for the money due to cleanliness of rooms, bed, location and service of the staff.",Barblovestotravel,2010-05-01,122005,2010-05-30,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Amazing location, fantastic views from room 3809!!!” On arrival the hotel has a very impressive foyer thats always buzzing with people 24/7. We stayed in a tower suite - room 3809. This suite has a terrace with fantastic views of the Manhattan skyline including the empire state building and the chyrsler building. The suite is a decent size with seperate sitting and sleeping areas. The marble bathroom is nice with decent water pressure in the shower! My only gripes about this place is that some of the staff are a little on the rude side. Having travelled to the states before, I expected the warm ''have a nice day'' attitude I have previously experienced. Not so in this hotel!!! be warned. The staff in the Tick Tock diner arn't that great either. I was also dissapointed to discover that the sky lounge open to suite residents for breakfast on the 39th floor was closed for two of the days were there, this is when we experienced the Tick Tock diner staff! When we did use the sky lounge the breakfast was nice - good bagels and coffee!! and a fab city skyline view make this a special affair. Aside to this the hotel is great with all the art deco elegance and charm I hoped for when I booked it.

"“Decent hotel, pretty bad service” I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel on business but often travel to New York for leisure as well. The hotel is not very close to Times Square and is actually in a very well lived area. The street is very busy and pretty noisy. The entrance was large and the initial staff were very pleasant and helpful. Check in was uneventful and I made it to my room fairly easily.
The room represents the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. It is obviously a very old hotel and many of the doors looked to be original. While the bedroom and bathroom were small they were clean and well kept. The bed was fairly comfortable and the linens were clean and well maintained. The air conditioning was very, very cold and I found that I actually had to turn the unit off. One of my colleagues did not have the same experience and remarked that his room was constantly hot.
The bathroom is really tight on space as well. You have a pedestal sink and a small glass ledge to place any items on. The shower has a lot of pressure but I found that the temperature seems to fluctuate wildly on its own. I had the same comment from one of my coworkers. One second it was hot, then it was cold, and then it was way hot. 
We did have a chance to use the concierge service which was interesting. The lady was obviously stressed out and wasn't dealing with it very well. We waited for about 15 minutes to be acknowledged while she shuffled phone calls. We listened as she started arguing with a person over the phone. She stated ""you sure you talking to me"" and was just extremely rude and loud. When we finally had her attention she wasn't very helpful and kept with the attitude of someone who was being bothered by our restaurant request. We finally decided that we could do better on our own. When we left I remarked to my colleague that going to the concierge was not very helpful. Evidently she heard this and started yelling at me. She started in again with the ""you talking to me, you got something to say, you got a problem with me"". She was pretty insane so I didn't address her and we kept walking. I ignored her since she was obviously unstable and hated her job. I actually felt sorry for the people that were waiting behind us for help. 
All in all, the hotel was adequate. However, I have stayed at multiple hotels in the area. The Hilton is still my favorite and I would say that this hotel is my least favorite. The concierge showdown was interesting to say the least. Why they would put someone in that position with an attitude I don't understand. 
All in and all it was good for the location of the event I had to attend. However, based on the overall experience I will not stay here again and would steer friends and family away from this one.",mrichardl,2010-05-01,122005,2010-05-27,False,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.6,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent hotel, can't fault it.” My husband and I have just returned from 3 nights at the New Yorker and loved every second of it! This is the most brilliant location for all attractions (including the subway - 3 different lines within 2 blocks) and the staff were great. Unknown to me, my husband had emailed in advance explaining that we were taking this trip for my birthday and that he would appreciate anything special they may be able to do for us...... well, they certainly delivered! We were pleasantly suprised with a room with a view on the 29th floor, with views of ESB and MSG, and they also gave us coupons for complimentary breakfast on our first morning which was excellent. All queries were helpfully answered, all requests carried out efficiently and checking in and out was painless. 
You can sign up for complimentary wifi in the room, it was excellent for my needs - looking up places of interest, addresses of places to eat, updating friends and family.

"“Best first NYC trip!” My sister and I stayed at the New Yorker for 6 nights back in July 2008. It was our first trip to NYC (her first trip to the States) and we'd just come off the train from Boston. When we arrived there were huge lines to check in and we were told they had had a computer system malfunction. Everyone was told that they could store their bags and they could go out and sightsee etc. and come back in a couple of hours when things should be fully sorted out. Apparently because the system had been down earlier, housekeeping hadn't been able to find out which rooms needed to be serviced for new guests, and they were running behind. My sister and I were exhausted and unprepared so we decided we'd just wait in line and see what would happen. We got to the front and were told that our room wasn't ready (which we expected) so we let them know that we were fine with that and were going to just sit in the waiting area (they said it could take up to an hour) and rest. After about 15 minutes the manager came up to us and said that he'd just checked and our room wasn't ready and that he was going to go up stairs and try and hurry things a long. A little while after he came back he said that our room wasn't ready, but he had another room available for us, the only thing was it had one bed and a sofa bed, but since we had booked a room with two beds we declined and said that we were happy to wait for our orignal. A little while later he came back and apologised and said our room still wasn't ready but would we like to see the alternative?? So I went to have a look and to say I was pleasantly surprised would be a gross understatement! The room they showed was a 1 bedroom corner suite with two bathrooms and a balcony! I went back down to my sister and said we were taking that room and I'd explain it to her later!! I just have to say, I thought that it was extremely accomodating of them, especially since we were happy to wait, and didn't have any complaints in the first instance. It made our trip to NYC the best and most memorable first stay in a new city! The staff were so nice, we felt very much at home by the end of our stay.

The location is great (a short walk from Macys) and there are quite a few restaurants near by. When I was there, I needed to extend my stay by a few days at the last minute.

"“An ok type of place.” First impressions count right? and yes, on first entering the Lobby you can't help but feel impressed, it's wonderfully lit, bright and welcoming. The check in staff were friendly, helpful and informative, (which for New York is amazing.) Just one tiny little niggle though, I e-mailed the hotel months in advanced to ask if it was possible to have a room with a view, as we were coming to N.Y. for my 50th, but ended up on the 21st floor overlooking Mcdonalds litter strewn roof top, not quite what I had in mind, but as I'd booked the holiday as a package tour maybe this wasn't available on my budget.
The corridor to our room was very cold looking with greyish painted walls and marble skirting boards, which on first glance looks like dirty,scuffed trimmings but look again and you'll plainly see it isn't. It's been mentioned the rooms are small, and yes, they certainly are and maybe a bit cramped, but look here guys, this IS New York and most hotel rooms in this city are anyway, so unless you're coming to the big apple just to sit on your bed, then hello......New York isn't for you. The Tick Tock Diner is very good, food lovely and very fairly priced, we had great service from all the staff there and their coffee is great, be advised, you can get coffee/tea to go as there are no facilities to do your own in your room. The bathroom,is again small but perfectly usable and the shower, well in our room anyhow, will keep you fit as the heating controls have a mind of their own and will deluge you with scolding hot, then cold then set temprature water,keeps you on the move when freshening up I can tell you.
The Hotel itself is quite well positioned, and fairly central to most attractions, Do try and use the subway though, great value, 2 dollars a ride and you can go as far as you want, 1 or 20+ stations, brilliant. One quick mention of the house keepers/maids. You were ALL so friendly and courtious, and you certainly kept our room spotless, so thank you and well done.",journol1st,2010-04-01,122005,2010-05-10,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Suburb location, beautiful hotel with great room view” Stayed in this hotel for Thanksgiving. Loved it! We had an easy check in and the girl on reception upgraded us to a new room with a great view for free. When we got to our room we weren't disappointed. The view was amazing, Empire state and Madisson Square Garden all there from our window. We had two queen sized beds, the decor was contemporary and clean. The bathroom was art deco style. We had plenty of room for all our shopping and to move around, you can't expect much room from a New York hotel. The Thanksgiving day parade was great and we were able to watch it from our room window, all the people participating in the parade used our hotel as a base to get changed, so we seen them all coming and going, it was very colourful.

"“Art Deco at its Finest” We spent four nights at this hotel last week. It was supposed to be three nights, but with the car bomb on 45th Saturday night, our flight home on Sunday was canceled. The New Yorker was very accommodating in letting us keep our rooms an additional night. This hotel is in a great location, convenient to major attractions in New York as well as the subway stations. There are many places to shop and eat in the immediate vicinity. The rooms are on the small side, typical of many in New York, but they are very comfortable and fairly quiet. It seems amazing to be in this location and yet no street noise can be heard in the room. (At least in the two different rooms we were in.) The shower head left a little to be desired in terms of the way it sprays, but there was always plenty of hot water. Basic internet service is free, and it was plenty fast for us.

Rooms are small but clean and modern, nice set of toiletries provided together with a fridge containing a couple of (complimentary) cans of soda - nice touch. We were allowed to check in around midday which again was noce, friendly front desk staff are a credit to the hotel and not typical of New York. The Tick Tock diner next door is a great 24 hour diner with large varied menu and just the job for jetlagged tavellers who are awake and hungry at 5.00am.

"“Great value for money - excellent location.” The New Yorker really represents great value for money and it's location is hard to beat especially for first time visitors to the city. The subway is right outside, Times Square, Empire State Building & Macy's are a 5-10 minute walk away & the 24 hour 'Tick Tock' diner attached to the hotel is handy for breakfast. We had a room on the 36th floor with a view of Madison Square Gardens. The room was fairly small but not bad for New York, the small cupboard was handy for storing cases & came with an iron & ironing board. The bathroom also has a hairdryer which is handy! Check in staff were helpful & efficient. You take your own bags to your room which I liked as you aren't then under pressure to tip & you feel more relaxed. The hotel has a fitness centre which could be handy.When we were stranded due to the Volcano the hotel were extremely helpful, they allowed us to keep our bags in our existing room until 4pm until we knew whether or not we would need the room & we extended our stay at the same nightly rate (rather than hiking up the prices). The location is busy with lots going on directly outside the hotel but if you want everything on the doorstep & ask for a room rond the back of the hotel you will enjoy your stay.

"“Nice Hotel, but poor Managemnet in a Crisis” Bear in mind that there are few cheap NY Hotels and the ones that are cheap are normally substandard. The New Yorker is mid-priced by NY standards. It’s a very nice Art Deco Hotel is an excellent central location – within walking distance of the Empire State Building, the Post office, Penn station and Madison Square Garden. Our room was not enormous but perfectly adequate and clean. The décor and furniture was ‘sound’ and not 'well worn' like many NY Hotels. The Hotels 24 hour ‘Tick Tock’ café was nice but overpriced like most hotels cafes are.
I have two gripes: the business centre only has two Internet PC’s (chargeable). I stayed in NY as an ‘Ash refugee’ (flight delays due to the Icelandic volcano) and there were queues to use theses PC’s all hours of the day. 
I initially booked two nights accommodation. I quickly realised that I would be stuck in NY for nine nights. I tried to book more nights on day one of my stay and was refused. I was told to return to the reception on day two. I was then refused on day two and told to return on the morning of day three (my check-out morning). This was obviously frustrating for me because I wanted to know if I could stay all week or would need to seek alternative accommodation, before I had to pack. 
Therefore on day two I used the Internet/Expedia UK to book more nights. I presented the confirmation paperwork to the reception desk. The guy said “fine, but if you booked through them I may have got a cheaper rate!” I explained that I had asked twice and not been allowed to. He said “that was odd, they were not fully booked”.
So I give the Hotel management one star but the hotel four stars. (If the Manager is reading this, I would love them to explain this strange policy to me)",TheLondonGuy,2010-04-01,122005,2010-04-29,False,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Very Nice New York Hotel” The room was small and outdated. The internet barely worked (I assume they have improved it since). Otherwise it is a very nice old school grand New York Hotel.

"“The New Yorker is a centrally-located, comfortable place to stay.” We liked our stay at The New Yorker hotel. Its location is literally across the street from access to trains, buses and subways. Times Square is right down the street within decent walking distance. My wife and I came to NYC to celebrate our anniversary (noting as such in our reservation). We stayed here two nights and had our 19 month old son with us. 
The staff was very courteous and professional. We reserved the Metro Room/2 doubles, and we were given a nice room with a direct view of the Empire State Building. Also, we were pleased to find the hotel room, lobby, and amenities are just as they are described and pictured. I liked the room and how it was decorated with contemporary furnishings. We had to report an issue with the water not being hot enough, but the front desk took care of it right away. They even sent an engineer to our room to ensure we were satisfied. They get a kudos for quick response! 
The Tick Tock diner was a good experience, also. The food is reasonably priced, tasty, and served fast! Our server was friendly too. 
I found the size of the room satisfactory, despite the number of reviews claiming the rooms are too small. I must admit it is slightly smaller than what you might expect, but not enough to complain about. The room is big enough to do what a traveler needs to do in a hotel room- sleep, shower and veg out. It also has a walk-in closet with iron/ironing board. 
We were a little disappointed that there was no coffee maker in the room, as we have come to expect this amenity in two-star and above hotels (the New Yorker being a 3-1/2 star). Although you have the on-site restaurant, it does not replace the convenience of being able to start your day with coffee before getting dressed.
Overall, this a great hotel to stay in. Its proximity to public transportation is a true selling point. We would definitely stay here in some of our future visits to New York City.",doublea91,2010-04-01,122005,2010-04-26,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

This hotel is very central-right beside Madison Square Gardens, Empire State Building and Macy's!!!! We were very luck as our room looked out at these! It only takes about 5minutes to walk to Times Square/Broadway/5Th Av and Central Park!
We ate breakfast in the Tick Tock diner every morning and this was good value for money and quick service, and so convenient as it is attached onto the hotel.
We asked Reception to organise transfers to the airport on the day of our departure, which they did and this cost us a lot less than our journey in.

Now the grumbles. Like another reviewer we found our room unbearable hot. The janitor came and turned the heating down but then the most awful banging noise stopped us from sleeping. This time we were moved to one of their ""newly refurbished suites"" What a laugh. Slopping some paint over tiles and putting in some hideous and large furniture is not my idea of refurbishment. Why didnt they spend more money on updating the central heating.

"“Did not sleep for a second.” We're not usually a budget travellers, but booked one night at this hotel because of an arrival in NYC one day earlier than planned. We had to wait one night untill we continued to our destination.
The hotel had notified before booking that there were some contruction going on and that's fair and decent. It was noticable in the lobby that they were redecorating. By the time this review is written the renovation may be finished. Anyway this didn't bother us too much for the one night we were staying.
We arrived quite late in the evening and upon check-in we were upgraded to a suite on the 42nd floor. At first glance the suite looked very nice. The bathroom were nice and clean. The room seemed to be of the newly renovated ones. We are very grateful for the very nice and complimentary upgrade from the hotel. 
The suite included a living room, a small kitchen area and a bedroom (with bathroom of course). Flat screen TVs in both rooms. Nice bathroom. Clean. The only thing was that the living room seemed a bit overstuffed as the furnitures required a lot of space. I think maybe some lighter furnitures would have made the room a bit more spacious. 
However there were some issues with this suite. First of all it was cold outside, but the room was still very warm. Being on the 42nd floor you could only open the window a few inches and had to use the aircondition. For the night this proved to be a problem. 
The aircondition is a seperate unit simply put in the window and there is no central airconditioning. At night we had to use the aircondition to be able to sleep because the room was simly too hot. The a/c made a lot of noice and after a while the room became ice cold. Then we turned it off and ti got quiet but after only a few minutes wery hot again. Then we turned it on and of course the noice started again and after a few minutes the room were very cold. We tried to adjust the a/c but it seemed like it was not adjustable to temperature. 
This kept on going for the entire night and it was impossible to sleep. The next morning we were horribly tired and very glad we didn't choose this hotel as a permanent hotel for many days. Otherwise we would have been exchausted. 
However with the prices in NYC and the general standard of this hotel (after renovations are finished) it might be a good deal if you're on a budget. At least the deal we got for our standard room was very good to be in NYC and the hotel is probably better after the renovation is finished. You could see it started to look very nice when we were there.
However the reason for staying in a hotel is to be able to sleep. I notice these aircondition units in every window so maybe Americans are more used to this. Unfortunately we didn't almost sleep at all that night. Without sleep it doesn't matter if you're staying at the Four Seasons or the Inn.",misterminute,2009-04-01,122005,2010-03-30,False,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.9,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“GREAT STAY” Just returned from a very pleasant stay at the NEW YORKER, check in very easy. room given on 37th floor spectacular views of Empire State Buidling and Chrysler Buidling. Be aware, when checking in they take from either your credit or debit card $180 dollars for extras charged to your room even if you do not wish to charge anything to your room.
Rooms seviced to excellent standard every day. Lovely comfortable beds good pillows all you need after a very hectic day, Hotel very close to all subways, Time Square and Empire State Buidling all of which are easy walking distance. We ate at the Tick Tock Diner for breakfast, cost approx $50.00 dollars for 3 very good service.
Quite a few people complained about water not being hot in bathrooms we had no problems with this but whilst we were there rooms under 20th floor had no water one day as they had to do emergency maintenace.
We took BiG APPLE Helicopter ride with Liberty this was Fab and well worth the money.

The room was very clean and was kept clean by the good housekeeping throughout our stay. Had really comfy beds!! The security at the hotel was impressive, there was always someone checking that you were actually staying at the hotel before you could use the lifts to your room, which we found very reassuring being two women on our own.

The New Yorker is also 5 minutes away from the Empire State Building and 2 minutes away from Madison Square Garden (its above Penn Station).
The hotel itself was very good. We weren't expecting anything special but the rooms were of a good size and the staff were friendly. You can leave your luggage in reception on your last day for just 1 dollar per bag (if you have a late flight).

"“The Place to Stay on a Budget” We booked our New York trip through a travel website that included our flight and hotel for a really great price. This hotel was the place included. The location was perfect. It's in mid-town right across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Times Square is in walking distance (about 10 blocks) and Koreatown/Chelsea is down the street. There were many restaurants to choose from in the area as well.
We arrived at 1:00pm and was told our room was not ready. They have a service that will take your bags so you can explore the city, which we did. When we came back at 3:00pm, they apologized for the wait and upgraded our room to a suite. Excellent! Our room was on the 27th floor with an excellent view of the city and harbor. The room was a bit small, but very cozy and plenty of room for 2 people. The Tick Tock Diner is located on the lobby floor and is a bit pricey ($35-40 breakfast for 2 people) with slow service, but the food was good.

I've done this three times and stayed at a different hotel each time. This is the first time that I've found a place we will definitely rebooking for our next visit.
Upon arrival, our keys (for 20 rooms) were ready and we had no problems checking in. The hotel is located right around the corner from Penn station and about a block away from the red lines.
The in-hotel diner was great -- good food and reasonably priced for New York. The rooms were generally spacious, though there was quite a difference in size, with one group even getting a room that had two bathrooms. The only issue was that the water temperature in the shower was inconsistent, but that's pretty minor.

"“Thumbs Up!!” I just recently returned from my trip to NYC and stayed at The New Yorker. We had a fantastic stay at this hotel and would definitely return! The room was clean and the bathroom was impeccably clean as well. The location is perfect for theatre goers. No taxis to worry about as it is walking distance to Broadway and Time Square. My teenager particularly enjoyed the convenience of the Tick Tock Diner especially after a show. The diner is attached to the hotel. Good food and very reasonable. We stayed on the 26th floor so we didn't hear any of the traffic. The concierge was friendly and helpful and the staff went out of their way to make our stay memorable. 
I am definitely returning to this hotel when I return to NYC!

We were abruptly (so much for the excellant service in the USA) and with attitude advised check in wasn't open for another hour, however the Receptionist then proceeded to check our booking. She was quick to tell us that each of the rooms only had 1 double bed, we advised this should not be the case as it had already been confirmed there would be 2 beds. 
After some tooing and froing and showing our confirmation, the Receptionist conceeded we if fact could have 2 double beds and her attitude changed, but not to the extent of apologising.

"“My new home-away-from-home in New York!” I read the reviews before booking my stay. I was in town to exhibit at the New York Times travel show so I was shopping for rate and location both of which were great. I love old hotels that have been renovated and I was really impressed with the job they did. The property is updated but retains is old charm. I e-mailed questions regarding the availability of parking and if I could get a refrigerator for my room. The response was sent back the next morning...valet parking available for a reasonable NY rate and yes to the refrigerator, no additional charge.
All staff were very pleasant and helpful. You flash your room key to security to enter the elevator area, which made me feel really safe. I changed my reservation to check in two nights early due to the huge storm and all arrangements were handled smoothly.
Additional comments...
My room wasn't huge but had all the space I needed. Great fitness room (no extra charge).
Very comfortable...I didn't have any issues with noise.

"“LOVELY HOTEL - WOULD STAY HERE AGAIN!” I was very impressed with this hotel. I found a high standard of cleanliness and our room (a two-bedded suite with view of the Empire State Building) to be a good size, especially for New York!! As we were on the 32nd floor, we did not find outside noise a problem at all and the room's heating/air conditioning worked very well. The bathroom was modern and clean. The staff were friendly and efficient. If you timed it wrong you could wait rather a long time to check in at reception and the receptionist forget to give us our breakfast vouchers when we checked in (we booked b+b with Letsgo2 travel company). However, this was quickly resolved on the first morning.
I have previously stayed at the Hotel Wellington in New York - after my experience there I would definitely choose the New Yorker over that one!!

The cleaning staff was accomondating and respected our wish to not have our room cleaned daily. We stayed on the 19th floor and the view wasn't the best, but was still nice for the price. The valet service was expensive ($70.00 for two nights), but made things much easier.

"“Great Location...Great Value....Great Stay!” I stayed with friends at the New Yorker Hotel in December 2009 and had the best time EVER!
Location:
Having not been there before, this hotel is amazing for first timersin New York! The location is excellent. Literally 10 minutes walk from Times Square, Macy's is a mere 5 minutes walk. Madison Square Garden is around the corner. Not mention the wide range of places to eat! Whatever you do make sure you dont take taxi's - they are too expensive! My advice would be to have really comfortable shoes and walk everywhere!
The Room:
The rooms were very clean and I could not complain. They came with a flat screen decent size TV with alot of channels.The beds were comfortable and the pillows were even more so! The rooms were cleaned once a day and all soaps/shampoo's were replenished. The bathrooms are small. But to be honest - who cares! Your in New York! We were hardly ever in the room! 
Staff:
The staff at the hotel were great. Very helpful and friendly. We had no problems whatsoever. The concerige facility was great too. We were due to leave for the airport at 4pm and check out was at 12pm. The hotel can arrange to hold onto your luggage after you have checked out - it only cost us $2.00!

"“Fab hotel, in a great location!” We stayed at the New Yorker Hotel for 5 nights in February, we were sceptical about the hotel as we had read some excellent but also, some awful reviews about the hotel, which worried us a bit, but fortunately, our concerns were forgotten as soon as we arrived; our stay at the hotel was fantastic! 
We arrived just before 3:00pm, the first thing we saw was the impressive art deco lobby and the chandelier, anyway, check in was at 3:00 and there was a long queue to check in, we were queing for about 20mins and service was quite slow , (which felt even slower after a long journey) a lot of peple were checking in with dogs as there was a big dog show in madison square garden, and a few peple were getting annoyed because they were being kept waiting. Anyway, we reached the front of the queue, and we checked in, were supposed t be on the 21st floor, but just as we were about to take the key - I think the man behind the desk was so relieved that we didn't complain that he upgraded us to the 34th floor!! 
The first 2 numbers on your room number correspond to your floor, nobody explained that to us, so we spent 5 minutes trying to guess which floor we were on - until the penny dropped...oops! Anyway, there are about 10 lifts in the lobby, so you're never waiting very long, and you can't go into the lifts unless you show security your key card.
So we (finally) arrived at room 3406. The room was spotlessly clean, it was small but well planned out, but, it had everything that you needed for a stay in NYC, it had a really comfortable bed, a flat screen t.v, a wardrobe, plenty of storage and a small bathroom with a bath and a shower, and a fantastic view of new York!! 
The room was small, but lets be honest you don't go to New York City to lounge about in your room all day!! The only thing that was missing was that there were no tea or coffee ammenities -and for us Brits, thats a neccesity, luckily we had packed a travel kettle, however there is a starbucks opposite the hotel. It was also very quiet, which I wasn't really expecting from a New York Hotel.
The location was excellent, opposite the hotel is a starbucks and around the corner a Duane Reede pharmacy, the hotel is also opposite Madison Square Garden, which is very handy if you have tickets to a concert or a basketball game. Macy's is a 5 minute walk away, and Time Square is a 10 minute walk away, and just outside the hotel was a subway, and it's a main line, so even if where you want to go isn't in walking distance it's easy to get to.
We ate at the Tick Tock Diner every morning, as it was convenient and the food was good, we tried to have a good breakfast every morning, I know it was a diner and is probably frowned upon, but there were a lot of New Yorkers eating there and the food was great, they had pancakes, waffles, porridge, eggs and bacon, and it was all pretty reasonabe, so we'd definately recommend that, we wouldn't however recommend the other resturant; Coopers Tavern, we only went in for a drink, and a glass of wine and and a pint of bud cost $17!! I'm sure the food was lovely, but we left because there was a man on the bar who was throwing himself at all the waitresses and was old enough to know better!
On our way home, we decided to book a car back to the airport, it cost $84 and was well worth it. The concierege behind the desk couldn't have been anymore helpful, we booked the car for 5:00pm and they saw we were waiting in the lobby at 4:10, so they offered to take us back to the airport early. We went back to the airport in a Lincon Continental, it was a lovely car and the perfect end to our trip.
The hotel was the perfect place to go back to after a long day sight seeing , it was spotlessly clean, the staff were polite and we would definately stay at the New Yorker again!",Thepinkjellybaby,2010-02-01,122005,2010-02-21,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“first time trip, amazing location!!!!!!!!!!!” Me and my girlfriend stayed at the new yorker from 7th-11th Dec and had an amazing time. I had planned to propose to my girlfriend while were there so i emailed the hotel in advance to ask for a nice room with a city view, the hotel responded immediately and noted the request. When we arrived at the hotel and checked in i was devastated to see i was in a pokey room facing a brick wall. I called reception to tell them i was unhappy with the room and asked to be moved straight away, as they were busy at the time they told me to leave it 1 hour then return to reception. On returning i was given a room on the 24th floor with a fantastic view of the Empire State building and Madisson square garden.
The Hotel is situated in the best possible location for sightseeing and exploring manhatten. Only a 2 min walk to Maceys and 10 mins to Empire state building. Times square was about 20min casual walk. We found walking to be best way to get around Manhattan as taxis were a rip off as you have to pay a waiting charge and in the manhattan traffic this soon mounts up.
On the whole The New Yorker is a fantastic hotel in an excellent location, felt safe at all times and had an amazing time, i would definately recommend this hotel to everybody wanting to explore new york
Oh and my girlfriend said yes!!! which topped off the whole break.",cqv04i,2009-12-01,122005,2010-02-19,False,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Are You Kidding Me?” Come on people, this is no 3.5 star hotel. How in the world could anyone recommend this hotel? From the moment we arrived (2 rooms, my wife and two teenage kids), the service ranged from disinterested to downright rude. The rooms are old and outdated, not to mention tiny, and the showers don't work. One second scalding and the next second freezing. There was mold all over one of our bathrooms and the other looked like it was last remodeled when Kennedy was President.
After two nights of regretting our decision to stay, looking forward to leaving, they then lost our car! It took them 1.5 hours to find it, lost in the valet. I missed a very important meeting. No apololgies, just excuses followed by demanding payment for unacceptable service. I travel to New York frequently, plus I used to live in the area. Apparently the staff at this hotel never got the memo that the lousy attitude New York was famous for in the 1980's doesn't fly anymore.
We stayed the second portion of our NYC trip at the Doubletree Suites about ten blocks north in Times Square. The stay at the Doubletree only amplified how bad the New Yorker is. A little more money, yes but first class rooms, service, and friendliness in a far better location. 
If you simply want a cheap place to crash (college kids, young couples) and care little about service, cleanliness, or ambiance, maybe this place is for you. But you may wonder why you can get all the rooms you want at the New Yorker for around $100/night on Hotwire? Answer: because it's awful. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again if the rooms were free.",brad935,2010-02-01,122005,2010-02-17,False,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Exciting first trip to New York.” The New Yorker is an old fashioned Art Deco Hotel and still has many of the original Deco Fixtures intact. All the Big bands played here in the 1920's and 30's so it has a fantastic feeling of a glamorous era now unfortunately no more, however if you have a sense of history and a feeling for place you may catch the sound of Tommy Dorsey belting it out in the big ballroom downstairs.. The Hotel fell into disrepair and was vacant during the 1960's and is just now coming back to life so there seems to be constant upgrading taking place.
My personal experience was very positive, as we had got a really cut price deal and having read the reviews I did not have very high expectations. However we got a two room mini apartment right at the top of the hotel, it consisted of bedroom, bathroom, lounge with large t.v. and small kitchen area. Everything was spotlessly clean and the bed was comfortable. The most fantastic thing about the room was the view , I just got my chair and looked at the fantastic New York skyline, that I had seen so often in the movies, there it was all rolled out at my feet. I did not care about the faucets or the size of the room or anything else, Nothing mattered, I was in New York

"“Great value in a good central location !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” I stayed here for 2 nites in early FEB 2009. I booked it through Priceline & got a great deal ( half off the going rate on the hotel's website.) We were coming into the city via Megabus from Boston so the location was prime. Our return trip to Bosaton boarded a block & a half from the hotel, thus minimizing time leaving NY & also quite convenient since we checked our luggage on our last day with the bellmen at the hotel for $1.00 a bag ( quite a bargain). Walked around the city most of the time & only used the subway twice because of the location of the New Yorker Hotel. The room was small, but quite manageable for 2 people. We had a queen bed, 2 nightstands, a small desk area, closet & adequate bathroom. The rooms were all remodeled over the past 2 years so everything is modern & up to date. The shower water temp was iffy, but that is understandable in an older property. Staff was very hospitable & helpful at all times. Room was spotless every time we returned. Also it was great to have a 24 hr drug store directly across the street. The lobby has been restored to it's original grandeur & it is a bustling center of activity. Security was great as you needed to have a key card to even get into the elevator bays. Nice to see... All in all we had a great time & the hotel was quite nice for the amount we paid per night.. My friend who lives in Manhattan came to see the room, as he was very skeptical at first when I had told him I had booked the New Yorker. He said it was always a ""roach hotel"" & not nice at all. He was stunned & amazed when he came for a visit to survey my choice of hotels, and stated that it was a really nice room & he would now recommend it to friends & family when staying in town. All in all, the New Yorker is a great value, centrally located, in the greatest city in the world.",robertwcook,2010-02-01,122005,2010-02-15,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good position, friendly staff, great location and views!” The hotel is in a good position. Before we left I read a review which said to email consierge and ask for one of the higher rooms and this was definatly a good move. Our bedroom looked out straight onto the Empire State with the Chrysler Building and Times Square on the left. 
The hotel room was a fair size, if you used the wardrobe and draws there was plenty of room for two people. The rooms were very clean and tidy. The only downfall was the bathroom which has not been modernised as the rooms have however the shower was always hot and fairly powerful so no real complaints! We used the consierge once and although we waited over half an hour they were very helpful.
The position of the hotel sells itself, ten mins walk to times square and a subway round the corner. I dont think you could beat this hotel on value for money however I would also recommend looking at the Grand Hyatt Hotel aswell.",twj4789,2009-12-01,122005,2010-02-15,False,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Excellent location for exploring the city, subway station next door to take you uptown and downtown, although majority of attractions and main shopping locations are within easy walking distance.

"“fantastic hotel great location made better considering the price” Stayed here for a weeks christmas shopping trip round thanksgiving time, for the price I paid I didn't expect the hotel to be as nice as it was I've read other review complaining about the size of the rooms but personally the rooms were more than adequate as the room included a double bed two bed side cabinets desk and set of draws the bathroom was small but with bath/shower sink and loo i couldn't find any problems with it
there are signs saying that they only change towels and bedding every other day unless you put out the card to ask them to do otherwise though the maids when i was there must not have been told this as they changed both everyday
the staff at the front desk where very friendly i spoke to them more than once a day as the safety deposit box are behind the reception desk
only one of the concierges wasn't as helpful when booking my transfers back to jfk 
other than that I can't fault the staff 
I can recommend the both the hotel diner and bar i only ate at the tic-toc diner twice (both times for breakfast) as the number of places to eat nearby is vast and both time were pleasant enough but there are nicer places round the city the bar on the other hand was extremely good I started and finished every night with a cocktail or two from there (I'd recommend the Manhattan)
The one thing I'd tell everyone to keep away from is the coffee from the guy between the desk and the tic toc diner as i have never tasted coffee worse in my life
Pros:
nearby the theater district and macys
clean rooms
friendly staff
extremely safe the only way to the rooms is up the elevators and there's always someone there to check your key card before get to the elevators
and like everywhere in new york you're never very far from somewhere to eat
cons
coffee at the snack stand inside the hotel",AndrewFoster85,2009-11-01,122005,2010-02-12,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent hotel - best location!” Very good hotel, not too expensive. Perfect location, 2 minutes walking from madison square garden, and a few more minutes to empire state building. We also walked to Times Square, 5th av. and central park. So you dont't get a better location than that.
The rooms were clean and nice, we even had a great view. The hotel is linked to a cafe, I think it was called ""tic toc"" or something, and they served very good traditional american breakfast :) the staff was nice too.
As you might understand I would definitely recommend anyone to this hotel! I'm sure going back to the same hotel next time I'm in NYC.

"“We all had a brilliant time....” ...this hotel was fantastic considering the price we paid for the holiday. Five of us went for my 50th birthday. It was centrally located for all of the sights, empire state building, Macy's and Madison Square Gardens to name a few. Penn Street Station is just across the road and you can find your way anywhere on the underground, especially if you want to go down to Battery Park, Ground Zero and Century 21 (fantastic store, you can find anything there and really cheap!). Times Square, Grand Central Station, Rockafella Centre are all within walking distance, but if that's not your choice, grab a cab as they're cheap enough. The bus tours (3 day ticket) are great value but we chose to walk around in the day and by night we were too exhausted to jump on the bus for a few hours so that was a waste for us really. We only did one evening tour. Central Park is fantastic, we went there on Thanksgiving and as it was a bank holiday it was buzzing, absolutely brilliant! Mind you the weather was fantastic for November, quite warm and sunny every day we were there.

Our rooms were larger than expected for Manhattan and newly renovated. The hotel tavern was enjoyed as well as the adjoining Tick Tock Diner.......good food and decent prices!!! The location was superb and offered everything at our fingertips. Everything was an easy walk or subway trip. Penn Station was 1 block and easily navigated on foot - even with luggage! The one negative was the bathroom was cold and had no exhaust fan!

"“Over priced and average” Better value is to be found elsewhere. The hotel is expensive for its 3.5 star tar rating. The rooms are small and although they have been redecorated they have not been renovated. The bathrooms are adequate but pokey. The walls are thin so guest room noises are heard in neighbouring rooms and sleep is usually interrupted by tourists returning late at night (and sometimes having loud ""debates"" in the hallways). The standard of housekeeping in the guest rooms, and the housekeeping staff, are excellent but the premises in general are run down despite new finishing and paint work, and the place has a musty smell. I had to ask to see the manager to have the bill corrected because I had been overcharged for phone calls. The desk clerk was rude and unobliging but the duty manager acknowledged the eror and fixed it . The Tick Tock diner is dirty and slow and the food and service are below the standard of the average New York low priced diner or cheap restaurant. The staff there appears to be unhappy and unfriendly, but the managers are always pleasant and obliging once they notice you're there. The other restaurant is an uninviting and noisy sports bar. The room service menu is a collection of menus from fast food outlets in the vicinity. The business center is minimal but reliable and so is the fitness center, which is being upgraded to a high standard. Internet connection is good but beware as it is eay to select the $9.95 option without realising that there is also a ""no charge"" option. Generally speaking, the hotel is overpriced for its average standard and poor service.",wme79736,2010-01-01,122005,2010-02-07,False,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The Hotel is right opposite MSG and Macys is only a five minute walk. Extremely easy access via Penn Train Station and buses run up and down right outside the front door.

Not only was the staff fantastic, but the rooms are just lovely. In just one room, my husband, two kids and I stayed comfortably in an elegant room, which was so clean and well-kept that I was in awe. When we decided to stay in for a night of television and relaxation, room service was prompt and right on point with whatever we ordered. 
The location is also perfect for shopping and sight-seeing. You are surrounded by a mall, the largest Macy's in the world and so much more- the discounts are great. Plus you are only a train ride away from wherever else you would like to travel in order to capture New York's true treasures.

"“Great location, some cleanliness issues” We were here Saturday night, Jan. 30. They checked us in early and--perhaps because of this-- there was no room inspection done. The desk had an empty lunch bag, the remnants of a ""goodie bag"" from the previous guest's event in NYC, about 8 pennies and some other flotsam on it when we arrived.
We were in a hurry to get to lunch and a matinee, so we didn't report it. That night when we looked in the shower, we noticed the leftover bar of soap and the shampoo container from the previous guest as well.
We made sure the linens were fresh, but this other stuff is not acceptable. Hot water mix was iffy in the shower, but not enough to quarrel about for one night.
On the plus side, lunch at the Tick Tock Diner downstairs was fast, good, and service was cordial. I did witness an obvious drug deal going down at the table next to me though--small scale, but including a couple of high junkies coming in off the street to visit people they knew. The restaurant staff shooed them out, but it was a NYC slice for sure.
Location is perfect for Amtrak and LIRR travelers coming to Penn Station and the elevators were fast. Security looked to be good and not overbearing.
Finally--I did not attempt to niggle down my bill upon departure, but they were appropriately appalled when I told them of the bad housekeeping and I probably could have gotten a discount.
I would go back again at the price, but would look carefully around the room and test the shower before accepting it.",abe11,2010-01-01,122005,2010-02-01,False,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Excellent base for shopping, sightseeing and MSG” I booked this hotel as a base for a weekend shopping trip. We were very pleased with what we found. There was no queue at the front desk so we were up in our room in 5 minutes of walking through the door. you are only allowed into the elevator area if you have a room key which made us feel very safe and there are a lot of staff in reception should you need anything. We stayed on the 25th floor which must have been painted that day as there was a strong smell of paint - but this was gone by the next morning.
The room was small - but this is New York, if you want a big room, you have to pay the big bucks (and even then the rooms can be tiny). The beds were comfy and the pillows were so good that my mum has emailed the hotel to ask where she can buy them from. The free wifi was another great bonus.
We had a few meals at the Tick Tock diner - the food and service were excellent. It was very busy in the mornings with locals, which is always a good sign.
The subway is a block away and there is an uptown bus stop right outside - the hotel really is perfectly situated for a tourist break.

"“Great Hotel, great value and location!” What started out as a one night business trip turned into a two night girls weekend because the hotel was such a value. I'm old enough to like nice things, but frugal enough to pay attention to price. The price was right, but I was sure that this would be very average NYC hotel room. I was pleasantly surprised. The room/hotel was art deco in style and a comfortable size for a delux double room. The bathroom was small but, who cares, its NYC! Since I was so happy with the hotel room, I decided to stayed another day for the same price. Even the two restaurants were good, Cooper's Tavern and the Tic Toc Diner. I traveled into NYC by train and went with friends to see 2 shows. Everything was walking distance. There was even a great Dunkin Donuts nearby for coffee. The hotel was celebrating its 80th birthday while I was there--red carpet was out and so were the bigs lights.",digigirl,2010-01-01,122005,2010-01-21,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“FANTASTIC HOTEL” Me and my boyfriend stayed here from the UK for Christmas and New Year, we reserved a new yorker suite which was huge, it had a living area a balcony a large bedroom and small bathroom, we couldnt of been happier with our stay.
We booked tickets for the Rockettes through the hotel which where at concerige when we arrived. The staff were so happy and helpfull. 
We ate breakfast at the tick tock diner every day, staff in there were not too pleasent but food was good.
Coopers tavern is the restaurant in the hotel this was very overpriced but nice for an occasion.
My boyfriend proposed to me in new york and when we told the hotel they had flowers in our room.
I have posted some pics of our room which was 2652. We were located on the 26th floor and had a great view.

"“Outstanding location, ideal for a short break!” We stayed at The New Yorker for 5 nights the week before Christmas and were pleased with the hotel overall. It is in a fantastic location right on the corner of 34th and 8th, over the road from Penn Station (with access to the red and blue subway lines), one block from macy's, and about 15 mins walk from Times Sq.
The only downside to the hotel is the small sized rooms with virtually no closet space, this however was only a small problem considering the bargain price we paid! Despite this the rooms are well decorated and have recently been renovated.
The Tick Tock Diner connected to the hotel via the lobby provided and excellent breakfast in the morning and despite cheaper breakfasts being available outside the hotel we ate here most mornings.

"“All you need out of a hotel in NYC!” The New Yorker hotel was absolutely brilliant! I stayed here in Oct 2001 with my family and of what I could remember it was a really nice hotel for us lol I love NYC so for my 21st/Christmas 09 me and my boyfriend decided to visit. Because of the occasion we wanted to stay in a hotel that was half decent - otherwise you can find some really cheap hostels to stay in NY. They've refurbished the rooms since I last visited. Rooms are gorgeously decorated - modern and simple. Rooms are generally small but thats like a lot in NY and to be honest who stays in there hotel room in NY?! You are literally there to shower (which was a nice powerful 1) and sleep (the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in!) Lovely place to open my xmas/birthday pressies in! I know some reviews hae mentioned thin walls but we had no problems and as soon as we were in the room, we were straight asleep because we were so knackered lol!
Staff were so helpful and polite. They literally know NY off the back of there hand - you ask them for recommendations of directions they know it straight away. As I've experienced before in NY, staff seem to have wonderful manners, using 'you welcome' and 'ma'am' wherever you are. My bf emailed ahead and asked for a room with a view which we got and we also had tickets for an ice hockey match (which everyone shoud go to - even I thought it was brilliant!!) sent to the hotel which we efficiently collected as soon as we got there. 
The lobby was amazing and decorated so festive for christmas, really made me feel christmassy even though i wasn't at home. Location was brilliant - right next to a subway station, walking distance to empire state, macy's, times square. 
We had breakfast in the diner in the hotel which was lovely but after a couple of days realised we were paying about £25 for breakfast! So found a lovely little place 1 block down on 8th and 33rd street. Lovely food but for half the price - about $20 instead!
I honestly couldn't fault this hotel. Inevitabley it was quite expensive for a decent hotel but not the most expensive! The only thing I was a little annoyed about was the fact that we had to pay to keep our bags in a room when we checked out. I know it was only like $4 but still, you don't even have to pay in the cheap hotels I've stayed in in Europe! Well worth the money - had a 21st to never forget!

"“Stay away from this hotel” We stayed in this hotel In January 2010 and it was one of my worst NY hotel experiences and we go to NY regularly. The rooms very very tiny and you could not go to the other side of the bed without walking sideways. It has been renovated but the hallways still look bad and the room doors are chipped and scratched. The shower was hard to control and the water was either too hot or too cold. 
There is no concept of customer service. My husband arrived with our reservation and I went to a show. Because the reservation was in my name they would not give him a room and made him sit for 3 hours until I arrived. When I expressed how disappointed I was there was no attempt at service recovery.

"“Low Budget Renovation of Old Hotel With Small Rooms Near Penn Station. Priceliners BEWARE” I am completely BAFFLED by all of the positive reviews. The New Yorker is an old hotel that recently had a (low budget) renovation (or better said, a ""cheaply renovated historic hotel."") Their web site photos are deceiving. It's not as large and not as nice as they web pics show. At $105/night (Priceline) we get what we paid for. The Priceline room they put us in what THE SMALLEST NYC hotel room I've seen (and I stay in Manhattan a lot.) (See pic with person barely able to fit between head of bead and the dresser.) Had to pay an upgrade fee to get what I considered a more standard room larger than a closet. So Priceliners BEWARE!! They will squeeze you into the crappiest room available and you'll have to beg for something more liveable. Complaints aside, this is a hotel with a GREAT LOCATION across/near Penn Station/Madison Square Garden (for those of you taking the train.) And if you're taking the DC-NY bus, several of them drop off and load right outside New Yorker. The Tick Tock diner was also a great place for breakfast and lunch.

The bed was comfy and I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the room was at night! Bathroom was average and shower went hot and cold a few times but was clean.
I also liked the fact that you have to show your room card to access the lifts.

"“Excellent hotel, exceeded expectations” We stayed at the New Yorker in December 2009. The hotel stood out as a budget priced hotel offering fantastic refurbished rooms in a great location. All of this turned out to be true. Although small, the extremely well refurbished rooms felt more than adequate, with the bed linen being of a good standard. The room and corridors around the hotel were immaculate. Staff were generally helpful and did what they could, although given the size of the hotel you don’t get that personal touch that you do in others. The benefit in staying in a bustling hotel like this is that you really feel you are in New York, there is a great atmosphere. We didn’t eat at the hotel at all, but did have a few drinks in the bar just off the lobby, which was always quite busy.

Each morning we started the day with a toasted ham and cheese sandwich and coffee from the many ""hole in the wall shops"" Right infront of you is the Empire State Building, Crysler Building, to your left, more than a climpse of Central Park and on your right the business district and if you get a clear day the grand lady herself :the Statue of Liberty.

"“Nice hotel, excellent location” Stayed at The New Yorker for 5 nights including the weekend of Hurricane Irene which fortunately wasn't too bad for Manhattan in the end but the hotel was very well prepared and kept you well informed and you felt perfectly safe. The rooms are not that big but adequate - also nice to have a hairdrier in the bathroom and your own iron and ironing board. The housekeeping was good but limited to just clean towels and emptying of bins during the Hurricane weekend and I think that was just lucky because we were in our room at the time but you have to remember all the transport came to a halt from midday on the Saturday until the Monday morning so they would have only had limited staff.
There is a diner adjacent to the hotel called the Tick Tock Diner which is open 24 hours and offers a wide range of food at reasonable prices and coped especially well during the Hurricane weekend. There is also a bar and restaurant in the hotel which serves good food but a bit more expensive than the diner and coped well during that weekend also bearing in mind that there were not many places open.
As for security you felt very safe and had to show your room key before entering the lifts. Reception was a bit slow but there were always so many people coming and going. The only negative I found was not having a safe in your room but had to queue at reception to use a room for this which we didn't bother with in the end. There is a room in the basement where you can use the internet - you need your room key to enter - you do have to pay but can use it free of charge for printing off your boarding pass the day before you fly back. The souvenir shop also sells phone cards - I bought a $5 card and couldn't believe I had over 2 hours talk time to the UK.

"“An excellent value hotel in a pretty central location!” We stayed in the New Yorker in October 2009 on our second trip to NYC and were pleasantly surprised and relieved at how lovely The New Yorker was. Having recently been refurbished, the rooms are clean and modern, albeit decorated in art deco style, and the beds are extremely comfortable, as are the pillows. The bathroom wasn't plush, however, it was adequate and clean, which is all that matters as you won't spend much time in your hotel room in such an amazing city.
After travelling the world, New York remains my favourite city of all time and I truly believe that, if given the chance, everybody should visit it at least once in their life time. The 24hr Tick Tock Diner serves fantastic burgers, shakes etc at extremely reasonable prices, and because it is away from Times Square is much better value for money! It took us approximately 20 minutes to walk to Times Square from the hotel, and after staying on Times Square last time we visited, I would certainly recommend this location as you get a far better hotel for your money off Times Square!

"“Would recommend to anyone!” I stayed here with my mum September 2nd-7th 2011 (just got back home today) and to be perfectly honest, couldn't be happier with the hotel!
The staff are friendly, the location is FANTASTIC and the hotel is perfect for a stop in The Big Apple... Okay, so the rooms, although very nicely refurbished and very clean, aren't the biggest - We had 2 beds, a TV, a desk and chair in a room that I can only say is about as big as a large, oversized closet, HOWEVER it was big enough for the 2 of us, and saying that, it served the purpose that we booked it for - TO SLEEP IN! We were on the 23rd floor, room 2343 and first impressions were that we didn't have a great view... We were in a part of the hotel that looked across at the rooms opposite, although it did have a side view to Madison Square Gardens, which may not be the prettiest of sights, but it was nice to say we could see it from our room. We did ask if we could move rooms, but were told that they were very busy, and there wasn't a lot of availability, so it wouldn't be possible (perfectly understandable though, when you take in to consideration the other fantastic aspects of this hotel.) There isn't a fridge in the rooms, and there are no tea/coffee making facilities... They DO provide a hairdryer, so no need to take unnecessary weight in your case with that, and they DO provide safety deposit boxes, however these aren't in the room, but are at a secure location next to the front desk down in the lobby. None of these ""negative"" points affected our stay though, as really, the only reason we had the hotel was to sleep in - I mean who wants to go to NYC and spend half their time in the room??? No-one! So for that aspect, it served our needs VERY WELL!
The location - WOW! Could not ask for a better location - literally a 5 minute walk from The Empire State Building, a 2 minute walk from the entrance to Macy's and no more than a 5-10 minute walk to Times Square - Right across the street from 34 Penn Street Subway Station, and literally a stones throw from Madison Square Gardens... COULDN'T BE ANY BETTER!!! If anybody complains about the location, they're INSANE! The hotel is located in a very busy part of the city down on 8th Avenue & 34th Street, but the noise is almost non-existent from the rooms - The only noise that seems to make it's way through is sirens, but this is easy to live with as they are very faint. If it's the location of restaurants and ease of access that sells a hotel to you, then you need not worry... Just downstairs in the hotel there are 2 options for eating; a typical American diner style cafe or a traditional bistro. Or, if you prefer to go out and about, then again you will be spoilt for choice - You can head to Times Square and eat in a world-renowned restaurant chain such as Hard Rock Cafe or Planet Hollywood, or head to a smaller typical style New York deli... Either way, you will find it hard to choose! There is also a McDonalds, Wendy's & Pizzeria just on the other side of the street from the hotel, which are (as far as I'm aware) open 24 hours a day.
I will DEFINITELY be staying at this hotel again... If you're looking for a reasonably priced, clean, practical, friendly base in the city that never sleeps, with an AMAING location, then 100% go for The Hotel New Yorker - This is a 3* accommodation, and yes there are other 4-5* hotels out there, but for the amount of time that you're actually going to be spending in the hotel, this is THE best place! Have that great location, the amazing service, and the incredible hotel for a great price, and save your dollars for hitting up those big stores on 5th Avenue!
I am a travel agent here in the UK, and I can honestly say that after staying here at the New Yorker, I will NEVER HESITATE before recommending it to my future customers!

The room was way too small, couldnt swing a cat in there, our view were other rooms windows and the t.v channels are the worst ive ever experienced, I'm no novice to NY and have stayed in cheaper hotels and got more channels to watch, Tick Tock Diner is way over priced.
I was bitten twice on my ankles while in bed, wasn't impressed, I would say the ONLY good point is the Location is perfect, Plus there are way too much bums in that area begging, overall if i was to return, I would think twice in staying here!!!!!!",Chan1971,2011-06-01,122005,2011-09-18,False,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.1,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Well located fair priced” First of all NY is NY and Manhattan is not a guest friendly town as other destinations. People are pretty rude towards tourists so you shouldn't expect aloha flowers or welcome cocktails at the lobby. It is a historic and pretty old but huge sky tower hotel . The hygiene is ok but the rooms and the bathrooms are pretty outworn. The staff are friendly but not truly professionals as you used to see in summer tourist areas. It is more like a business stop than a holiday resort. Its location is just great you can walk to times square in 5 minutes same as Broadway and MSG is just next to the hotel. Subway entrance is across the street so you can go to where ever you like in 15 min time. The price fair comparing to other hotels in Manhattan. Ifyou dont expect luxury or high tech and ave limited budget I say o for it and book early as we did. Otherwise it wont be fair priced surely.,eroltoksoy,2010-10-01,122005,2011-09-06,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Not sure how much to blame on the Hurricane....” I'm really writing this with mixed feelings and will try to be a objective as I can. My family and I stayed here the Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday during Hurricane Irene's visit. We booked through Travelocity or Expedia (can't remember) and got a fairly good rate of $199 per night. First, the location. Very, very good. Walking distance from Times Square, Broadway Shows, great restaurants, etc. - really can't beat the location. Check in went fairly quickly and was charged extra (believe it was $25 but could have been $50)when we asked for 2 double beds instead of the 1 King bed (there were 3 of us, my husband and my teenage son). Got a room on the 21st floor and first impression was that 1921 was the last time any updating had been done to this floor. Room was about the size of my closet. No exaggeration. Two tiny ""double"" beds and a desk and chair and there was no more room. Son used ""free wifi"" one night and it suddenly terminated. A call to the front desk got a response of ""yes, there are problems but there is a ""work around"" if you call the ""help desk"" listed in your information booklet. Problem with that? No number listed for anything like that in entire booklet. Went through it 3 times just to be sure. The room had none of the ammenities that we've come to expect as standard in most hotels like coffee maker or fridge. There was a hair dryer - but that was absolutely the only ""extra"" that existed. Of the 4 nights we stayed there, housekeeping only came once without us calling to request it. Twice if you count the day we requested it 3 times. Now, due to the Hurricane, not sure if this lapse in housekeeping is the ""standard"" when you book a discounted room, or if the impending hurricane caused them to be short handed and the management never saw fit to mention it if they were short handed. We saw cleaning staff on our floor each day and as we left in the morning (we are early risers) they would always ask ""Would you like your room cleaned today?"" to which we would answer ""Yes!"" Each night we would return to unmade beds and no clean towels. Something got lost in the translation of ""yes""??? During the night of the hurricane we had to open doors to hear the announcements and even then it was very hard to hear. As one other reviewer here mentioned, the lobby was always packed - not even positive that they were all guests as room keys were only checked as you approached the elevators. Hotel was clean, but simply very very old and staff was not nearly as friendly, accomodating or interested in assisting guests as we have experienced in other hotels. One employee who had been leaning over the doorman counter for at least 45 minutes couldn't be bothered to answer a quick question as to the nearest place to pick up subway and waved us to the concierge. And I should close by saying that we are not overly picky or demanding people - but cannot in good faith recommend this hotel to anyone else with the dated interior, lack of basic items and lack of effort by staff.",Seasonsgrt,2011-08-01,122005,2011-09-05,False,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Our room wasn't the biggest but it was all that we needed as we were only there to sleep. We were on the 19th floor which was the lowest floor for the rooms.
The Tick Tock Diner did amazing breakfasts and the staff were so nice, their banana pancakes were to die for!
The hotel definitely has a 1930s feel, which adds to its appeal in my opinion. I didn't feel at all unsafe when walking around outside the hotel, it's New York the streets are crammed with people, just be extra careful.

"“WORSE than I could have ever imagined!!” Words do not describe how awful this hotel is. Primarily the service and to boot, dirty, old rooms!

"“Would 100% stay here again!” I went to New York for my 30th birthday and I am so glad I picked this hotel. After my step mum emailed the hotel telling them of my birthday, I was upgraded to an Empire State Building view which was exellent. I was also given a box of chocolates on my arrival. The location in exellent, close walking distance of Times Square (about 10 mins), 1 block from Macy's and The Empire State Building. The Rooms are small but from what I had heard from New York, I expected smaller. There was enough space for the two of us. The only down side was there wasn't enough shelf space for all of my make up and toiletries. The beds are so comfortable and rooms are well maintained by housekeeping. The rooms are quite basic, if your looking for luxury then it is probably not the hotel for you but if you are looking for comfort, clean with exellent customer service and a location that couldn't get much better then this hotel is perfect!
After we checked out, we left our luggage in the hotel for a small fee as we were not leaving till the evening. We had a problem with our bank cards that day due to 'unusual activity', all my cards were blocked. Even though I had checked out, I went to the desk and they let me use the phone free of charge until I had sorted out the problem. Every member of staff I dealt with could not have been more helpful. If I ever get the opportunity to go to New York again I would not hesitate to stay here.

"“Meh.” The New Yorker needs to kick it up a notch. They have a great foundation with some killer art deco architectural elements, a great location across from Penn Station and an attached restaurant and 24 hour diner, but the decor was cheap and everything needed a fresh coat of paint. 
As guests enter the lobby, you can see this must have been an amazing space back in the day, but it is void of decoration and key design elements. A large hotel lobby circular couch would make a world of difference and add some flow to the room. The walls are begging for a bas relief or posters from the 30s or well... ...anything! 
The room was small, poorly lit and the tv was crammed over in a corner. The bed was comfortable. The wireless was pitifully slow and there was no free wireless in the lobby. The bathroom had peeling paint and it was too small to move around. The shower had two hot and cold faucets and I could not get a consistent comfortable temperature. 
I would not recommend the Tick Tock Diner and I would strongly caution against Cooper's Tavern. The caesar salad was okay, but I was served an undrinkable glass of Malbec that was sharp and acidic. There was also a real funky smell in the bar and the bartenders were inattentive or rude.

Very disappointing that a hotel of this calibre would stoop to such tactics.

"“Great hotel, great location!” Actually all of my experiences with the New Yorker Hotel are great. I stayed at the hotel for Christmas and upon arrival we noticed many nice decorations including a Christmas tree in the lobby. We arrived from JFK by subway and the stop at 34 Street / Penn Station (blue line) was right beneath the entrance. There were no lines for check in on arrival and the staff member was very friendly. 
The room on the 31 st floor was a bit small but you don't need any bigger while in NYC in my opinion. It was clean, had a nice bed, a desk, a flat screen and a good bathroom. For breakfast the next day we simply headed down to the Starbucks located on 8th Ave, opposite the hotel and brought the food up to the room, just like ""everyone"" else did. It was also perfect that they offered free WiFi in every room. The connection for the free service was outstanding so I can't see why people would actually pay for a better one. I was able to Skype with my family with no problem.
Within 1 minute of walking from the entrance of the hotel there is (at least) two Starbucks, two Dunkin' Donuts, one Taco Bell, one McDonalds, one Burger King, one Wendy's, one Duane Read and one cinema. Furthermore, the location is really great. It takes about 3 minutes to Macy's, additionally 5 minutes to the Empire State Building, approximately 10 minutes to Times Square. 
The New Yorker Hotel is indeed a good hotel. We paid 8 200 SEK (approx. 1150 USD for 6 nights) which was a good deal, prices are normally higher.

"“Awesome - would definitely stay here again” We had a fantastic stay in this hotel from start to finish. We arrived earlier than the check-in time however were greeted with very friendly reception staff who checked us in without any problems. We had upgraded to a larger room with a view and boy from the 35th floor (room 3515) a view did we get. Unspoilt views of the Empire State Building and Crysler Building - totally mindblowing. The room was lovely and was cleaned well throughout our stay and the bed was very comfortable.
The transportation desk were very helpful and friendly when booking our return trip to the airport. Checkout was very efficient and the staff at the luggage store were very friendly and at $1 a bag it was very reasonable.
I thought the food at the Tick Tock Diner was amazing and unlike other reviewers didn't find the prices bad at all. Coopers Bar is good for drinks although I wouldn't rush back there to eat. Staff were very friendly though.
I don't have a bad word to say about this hotel and would recommend it to everyone and would definitely stay again. As the other reviews state yes the rooms may be a little small but the location is amazing and close to everything and in New York City how much time do you actually spend in your hotel room?!
There's a subway station 1 min from the hotel and this is definitely the best way to get around. One final tip - if you're looking for a good night out try Cafe Wha in McDougall Street - had the best night ever in this bar and the live band were amazing....

"“Functional hotel in a good Location” For a first time visitor to New York, the location of this hotel is excellent - bang in the middle of the city, close to Macys, Empire State, Madison Square Garden and if you love walking, equi distant from Central Park or down to the Financial District. It is really touristy though and exceptionally busy. 
My only criticism of the location would be that we love nice bars and restaurants and the choice around the hotel was all diners and Irish pubs. It was a $15 cab ride down into Greenwich Village/Soho (where there are loads of nice places to eat and drink) and would probably stay in these areas if we visited again. 
The staff were really helpful, especially the concierge who were happy to get us jazz club reservations, theatre tickets etc...
We had paid for an upgraded room and the man on reception said he had upgraded us again to an even bigger room - well if this was a double upgrade, I would hate to see the size of a standard room as our room was really small with barely enough space for the double bed and TV. We had read previous reviews and had expected the rooms to be small (which is why we paid for an upgrade) but do be prepared for very small rooms. 
In summary this is a really good hotel just to dump your stuff and get out into the city, do not expect luxury or the 'personal touch', the lobby is busier than Leeds station at rush hour but as a base to see the main sites, it does the job very well.",CLM78,2009-12-01,122005,2010-01-03,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Budget accommodation that's perfectly serviceable” The New Yorker is one of those iconic old school New York buildings that stares back at you from a million calendars and postcards - and the lobby doesn't disappoint, packed with Art Deco features.
The rooms are a bit cramped, but the location is what brings you here - right in the middle of the madness. We were advised to ask for a room ""higher up"" as these should be bigger and more recently renovated - not sure if this is true, because everything looked a bit ""tired"", though it was all clean and perfectly serviceable.
Visit the Tick Tock Diner that's on site, if only to watch the organised chaos that is breakfast! How they make sense of it, I really can't fathom!
This is not a hotel for lounging in for hours at a time - but that's not why you go there! Dump your bags and get out into the thick of the action, at a price that's more than reasonable.

"“Iconic NYC hotel in a very central location” One of NYC's iconic hotels from the 1930's, the New Yorker is quite charming. The huge lobby still retains many of the features that made this such a famous hotel when it opened in 1929.
Rooms are very nicely decorated and quite comfortable; although our room with two doubles (more like king singles) was very tight. We had a room on the 24th floor with nice views down 8th- traffic noise was negligible even though this area buzzes all night. Free wifi in the rooms and good qualiy flat screen digital TV. Bathrooms actually have baths with good water pressure and plenty of toiletries.
The location is excellent and is right on the 34th Street subway (the 'A' train to Far Rockaway takes you right to the JFK Airtrain at Howards Beach for a fraction of the cost of a taxi).

"“Premium hotel in excellent location” My brother and I stayed at the New Yorker with a good friend on 12/19-12/20, and I can't say enough good things about this place. The rate was relatively great for the time of year, location and upscale-nature of this hotel. I arrived in the afternoon and was greeted by a very friendly and knowledgeable bellman - Hector - who not only had someone park my car but got detailed information on the comedy club I was going to be attending and how to get there (Caroline's at 50th and Broadway). I then proceeded to checkin and spoke with a very lovely young lady who was extremely friendly and provided great service. Although housekeeping was in my room when I got there, they were also very friendly and quickly, yet thoroughly, finished cleaning my room.
The front-desk staff, lobby staff (who checked keys to make sure non-guests weren't granted access to the elevators - and I saw them turn several people away who didn't appear to be guests) and all maintenance and housekeeping staff were extremely engaging and friendly, at all hours of the day and night.
The room was much larger than I expected, as I've stayed at multiple hotels in New York before. It had two double-sized beds, which to me were borderline queen-sized; yet there was still ample room for a desk, seating area and luggage-storage area. There was also a good-sized closet with ironing board and iron, and the bathroom was extremely clean and good-sized.
I reserved the room for a 3rd night (12/20) in anticipation of being snowed-in during the blizzard that weekend, but I changed my mind the next morning when I could see from my window that the roads had been cleared. Although I called to cancel my reservation, I saw a charge appear on my credit card for it and I called to rectify the situation. I spoke with Nicole, who was extremely friendly, helpful and well-informed, and she worked with management to have the charge removed. She followed up shortly after we spoke on the phone to let me know that it was a mistake on their end, although it very well could have been my mistake. No questions, no disputing, etc. - they just took care of it. Excellent service!

"“Fantastic location - don't expect a big room though!” We stayed here for 3 nights on our first trip to NYC. The hotel is massive (as is everything else in the city!) although the rooms are just about big enough to hold a double bed, writing desk, chest of drawers and little else. 
The room was tidy and the bed comfortable, which is all you need when in New York. There is a diner connected to the hotel, and coffee/croissants available to buy in the lobby every morning.
The staff were very helpful and informative, although there is a small charge to hold your luggage once you've checked out.
Times Square is a few blocks walk, as is 5th Avenue and Broadway. The subway which runs by the hotel takes you to many areas of the city, or to a connection to other lines.

We had a Junior Suite which had a small living room as well as a bedroom. The best part was the 2 bathrooms. The hotel is older but very clean and comfortable.

"“if you get a good deal, definately worth the stay” First of all, my expectations of new york were not not great, as im from London I pressumed that New york would just simply be be a bigger version...how wrong I was. Getting to the hotel from JFK wasnt too bad. We paid $24 for a return by coach and the jouney took approximately 45 mins. Booking in was a peice of cake, 15 mins max, and whilst waiting we had a chance to admire the lobby area which was suprisingly impressive for a 3* hotel. The room was quite small, but New York is definately not the sort of place where you spend your holiday in a hotel room! Just a two minute walk from Time square, the hotel is perfectly positioned, and will allow you to explore that part of New york well without venturing too far from the hotel. Clean, freindly staff and comfortable beds...well worth the stay.

"“Great hotel in a superb location for the leisure traveller” First time to stay at this hotel but on next visit to New York The New Yorker will be my first choice. I lover the ""older style"" decor giving the place a grandeur look from the past. The room were clean, bedding changed frequently ....yes maybe the room was smaller than most hotels but I only want it to sleep in so as long as the bed is comfortable and its got an en suite there is no more I want. The bed was absolutely huge could have slept 4 with ease.
The staff were so polite and efficient. I went accross road to get us a couple of Starbucks coffees and getting out of the lift on the 32nd floor I dropped one spilling it everywhere. A member of staff appeared from nowhere, assuring me there was no problem and he would attend to it right away...within 3 or 4 mins it was all cleared up

"“Great” I have just been reading some bad reviews about this hotel and Im unsure why. Me and the better half nooked this hotel through Expedia, this being our 5th stay in NYC. 
This was by far the best hotel we have stayed in. We got there at 1pm when check in wasnt until 3 and I asked the check in lady if we could have a room with a view. We were told that the room class we booked didnt have a view but she would see what they could do. She came back and told us we could have a free upgrade with a nice view. 
On getting to the room, it was large with blown heating (the previous hotels I have stayed in in NY has been the steam type that bang all night), a clean bathroom and bedroom, a flat panel TV with HD and many film channels. The pillows and mattress were very comfy. Wehn we looked out the window we could see the top of the Empire State building and Madison Square Garden (complete with what seemed to be most of NYPD's finest) right out the window. Perfect. In all fairness, if we didnt have a view, would it matter??. We go there to see New York, not sit in the room and read.
On checking out we left our bags with a bell boy for $3 at 11am and returned at 6 to collect them. The only reason why I put a 3 for service is the luggage was the only service we needed. We will definately go back.",imalwaysonmyhols,2009-12-01,122005,2009-12-19,False,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good value art deco experience” I had real trouble finding a central manhattan hotel at under $250 a night. When I found the New Yorker through my airline I thought it sounded too good to be true. But it wasn't. The New Yorker is a lovely art deco hotel in a very central location. Two blocks to Macys, a short walk to Times Sqaure and all the theatres, also across the road from Madison Sqaure Gardens.
The room was very clean. It would have been spacious apart from the US habit of putting two double beds in every room. The bathroom was tiny but clean and even the shower head was art deco and branded. We had a view of the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings. The staff were all friendly and helpful.
This is a busy hotel and you may need to be patient to get served at peak times but that is to be expected. The Tick Tock diner is real NY experience although we found it too busy at breakfast and instead walked the one block west on 34th Street to the Skylight Diner which was excellent.",mcreader,2009-12-01,122005,2009-12-18,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent Hotel with excellent view” I asked in advance for a room up high with a view and they certainly gave us that on the 31st floor with a beautiful view of the Empire State building. 
Very clean, very friendly and very central. 
Not one complaint!!",Chris-McWilly,2009-12-01,122005,2009-12-16,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Recommended hotel” I have been checking trip advisor since we booked 3 months ago and I would say in general the comments are fair. We requested an upgraded room for my parents and were really pleased with the room provided - although small, their view of the empire state was absolutely amazing and really made their trip (room 3516). My brother and I and our partners were also upgraded to the 35th floor and although small, the linen and fixtures provided in the rooms were of a really good quality for a relatively cheap hotel (roughly £160 each for 4 nights). No mice or noise as I have seen in other reviews!
The staff at the transport desk were absolutely brilliant to my mum when she was arranging our transfer home and Ruth on the check in desk was really accomodating with our requests. Omelia on the other hand was quite rude when we tried to check in to our 3rd room after explaining we had been told our room wasn't ready a few hours earlier - she checked us in to a room we already had and when we came back downstairs a couple of mins later she ignored us and obviously knew she had messed up so walked straight past us!
The hotel itself is very busy, attractive, excellent location and a great base to make sure you fit in as much as manhatten has to offer. Yes a fridge and tea / coffee facilities would be nice but you can't have everything!
We had a few drinks in coopers tavern (if you don't tip them right the first time then they won't speak to you again!) and the food at the tick tock diner was adequate but I would get yourself to Elins stardust diner near times square for a truly great breakfast (milkshakes are amazing) at a cheaper price.

"“Great location, excellent first exerience of NY” The main thing I would highlight for this hotel is the location. Macy's and the Empire State Building only a couple of minutes away and Times Square 10 mins. Excellent for access to subway and there a bus tour stop almost on the door step.
Our room was fairly small but we had 2 en suite bathroms whcih was good because there were 3 of us staying. The view was of a brick wall too but we weren't there to spend much time in our room so it was clean and functional enough for what we needed. Free wifi in the rooms too which helped us stay in touch with family.
Can't really comment on the sevice, most folk were nice enough but we really only experience reception staff and a couple of bell boys. We used New Yorker Rides, the hotel's transport, for our airport transfers from Newark and would recommend checking this out as it worked out cheaper for us to get a private car than a shared shuttle bus service.
I would also say that the on-site diner, the Tick Tock, is over priced for what it is, head over 1 block towards 9th Avenue and you get more and better for your money, especially for breakfasts.",Weaniewotsit,2009-11-01,122005,2009-12-14,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Absoloutely horrible experience” My wife and I stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights over the Thanksgiving Day break. We are not people who complain or whinge like everyone who normally writes negative reviews on these sites, however this is a truthful review of a very average experience. New Yorkers are notorious for being ruder than most Americans, this could not be exemplified more in the hotel. Upon ckeck in you will not be greeted with a smile, rather a frown and a ""why are you here"" attitude. If you actually make it into your room as it is the size of a shoebox with shoes inside, you will find it resembling a cell from Alcatraz Island. Want a cold drink after a long day of sightseeing? Well you are out of luck as the room won't have a bar fridge. .
If you take a visit to the business centre you can enjoy internet usage on one of two computers. If you would like to get some info from the concierge go right ahead, just be prepared to be interrogated and given multiple sighs for asking a simple question. My wife asked for the Concierge to kindly arrange our airport transfer for the next day, our response, ""you speak perfectly good English, I cannot see any reason why you can't just ring!"". Top customer service there. 
One morning we woke up to what seemed like a scene from Ladder 49. The room stunk of cigarette smoke. Upon making reception aware there was not even an apology, delightful! 
To top it off upon leaving the hotel and collecting our baggae from the bell desk we were told to ""move out of the way!"". 
The entire experience felt like we were role playing as prisoners of war. It was the worst stay out of our 3 week honeymoon around the states. We always read these reviews and thought there is no way we would post however we want people (especially Aussies) to get a raw true picture of what this place is like. 
New York is a great city with many fantastic things to see, it is a shame the majority of people are horrible and just make you feel thankful to fly out of JFK! The New Yorker is very overrated, albeit in a good location. The only thing we enjoyed in the place was our delightful view of a brick wall with pipes.

"“Retro Charm” Staying at the New Yorker is like stepping back in time. The art deco look throughout the hotel, rooms, and dinner is very cool. Rooms were somewhat small by modern standards however very clean and comfortable for no more than two.

"“Quite good facilities, totally unbeatable location, but it'll cost you...” PLUSES: 
Great location, catty-corner from Penn Station, one block from Madison Square Garden, complete ease of movement elsewhere in town. With Penn Station almost at the front door one can get to and from there and JFK airport for $10.75 each way (AirTrain + LIRR @ Jamaica Station and back).
Good meeting facilities, a couple of nice eateries adjacent to the lobby (then again, so many great ones within walking distance...). 
Nice déco styles. Room (a _ _ 10 room in an upper floor) was renovated and very well appointed, a cozy-to-tight main space, as expected downtown, but with a very comfortable (if old-fashioned as far as fixtures go) bathroom for downtown and a surprisingly ample closet, well-chosen furniture and decor and, to my delight, both good natural light and sufficient lamps in both amount and brightness! Very good climate control in the room, too. 
MINUSES: 
Compared my conference rate to non-conference rates and boy, I'd think twice if it were on my own dime! That's Manhattan for you. Also many of the other attendees at the business meeting had difficulties with discrepancies between their reservation confirmation e-mail and what the desk was telling them they had, that needs to be worked upon.",JRDelirious,2009-12-01,122005,2009-12-08,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

The rooms are quite small, but it's an older building so it's to be expected, but since they rennovated it the furniture and beds are very nice. The pillow top mattresses on the beds are very comfy and I got a great night of sleep. The rooms were very clean and the bathroom as well. The only complaint I have is that the water pressure in the shower was terrible and it was hard to feel clean when you had to get so close to the shower head just to wash your hair out, etc. The view from our floor was great and also the location is great.

"“The holiday to end all holidays!!” The Hotel New Yorker is a fantastic art deco hotel that has recently been refurbished and it really shows. The rooms are not massive but more than big enough for the 2 of us for a week plus storing oodles of xmas shopping!!
The staff are great, very friendly and happy to help - particluarly the transport staff who helped us organise our return to the airport and confirmed our flight etc. The Tick Tock diner is very reasonably priced and the food is great - especially the pancakes :-) plus the staff are so lovely and with it being open 24 hours it is really handy.
The best thing about the hotel is the location...its SO central for everything!!! You are literally a 5 minute walk from Times Square, Madison Square Garden, Macy's, The Empire State Building and many more!! We fitted in about 3 weeks worth of sightseeing into 1 week!! We would really recommend doing the grayline bus tours as they are a great way of getting from uptown to downtown and getting all the info and gossip on all the sights plus you can get on and off at any point. The other amazing thing we did was the night time dinner cruise round Manhattan which we cannot recommend highly enough!! The other fab thing is going to the top of the Rockerfeller Centre - we did this as well as the Empire State Building and actually preferred the Top of the Rock - do it on a clear night and we swear you will be actually speechless!!!!

the rooms are very comfortable and clean, medium in size and with a fair size bathroom. We were given a renovated room and the furniture and bed were very good. Our room was on the 34th floor so the view on Manhattan was incredible!
the check in was very smooth and after that we never had to get in touch with hotel staff: the key room is also a pass for the hotel facilities and is very easy to use. 
they provide complimentary wireless connection in the rooms which is a plus.

"“Serves a purpose” We selected this hotel, as it was the staging ground for the Macy's Day Parade which we were in. I guess if you are a tourist it does have the advantage of being centrally located in a slightly seedy part of town ( especially at night) . The staff was accommodating, and allowed a late check out without a problem. The size of the room was TINY. I guess for the price I did expect something slightly bigger. We had a queen size bed, and there was about 2 1/2 feet of room on both sides of the beds. That was it. There is an ironing board but NO ROOM SAFE- which I thought was very odd. Bed was comfortable enough for one night. Bathroom was refurbished but tiny. They had all necessary toiletries. My biggest complaint though was the noise from the alley ways, and streets - and we were on the 23rd floor. My husband who could sleep through a hurricane complained about the noise level the next morning. 
The hotel serves a purpose - It is clean enough and centrally located but I thought a bit expensive for what you actually received.",ldtc2,2009-11-01,122005,2009-11-28,False,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good hotel large rooms, Very clean- Shame about certain unprofessional check-in staff & poor reservations department” Stayed at the new yorker hotel for 5 nights this november.
On check in we were of course very excited having just arrived in NY and looking forward to our stay at the new yorker as this has been booked 8 months in advance.
Our excitment later turned to anger at the way I was spoken to by the gentlemen who checked us in as the reservations department had not make our booking correctly.
We booked 8 months in advance and payed £100 extra for a double double room with a view- website states a view of the city or hudson river.
When I make my booking I requested a city view and I also emailed the hotel 4 weeks before my visit to request a city view.
On check in I was advised that my view was ' A brick wall' and the hotel was full. 
I told the person who checked me that this was unacceptable as this is false advertising as room states' City view or Hudson river view' also not fair concicdering we booked so far in advance and my request of a city view couldnt have been more ignored.
The gentleman who checked me become very rude with me and totally unprofessional.
At no time was there an apology or understanding, the hotel was not full 8 months ago when i booked it & upgraded my room to a room with a view and It is not acceptable to argue back with a customer. 
After 20 minutes of fighting my corner I was finally offered 2 other rooms, I got sent up on my own to go and view these rooms. Neither were city views however one had a hudson view so I taken that room- Why couldnt that be offered to me in the first place.
I do think that although this was the job of check in to resolve this situation if reservations had done there job properly in the first place this problem would not have occurred. 
Not only should a request be taken into concideration when making someones booking but more importantly what they actually payed for. Your can not advertise an upgraded room saying you get a view then be given a view of a brick wall, this ismisrepresentation, wheather the hotel is full or not this is not the customers problem when you sell the room 8 months before.
I shouldnt have to argue my case to be given a room that is mine, that I had payed for.
Our room a double double room was large, good wardrobe space, very clean and modern.
The maids would come in everyday and kept our room immaculate.
The doormen were lovely, very friendly and helpful. They do a great job!
It was great to see security on shift 24/7, they always said hello and directed you to areas of the hotel when asked.
The tick tock diner is great value for a lunch or evening meal, the portons are very generous and the staff are friendly.
Overall I was happy with my stay at the new yorker, rooms and hotel is great it was just a shame I didnt have a good experience with check in or reservations so for me this really let the hotel down. I later spoke to the manager about this and she was very apologetic which was greatly appreciated. I would not let this incident stop me from staying at the new yorker in the future however I would hope to see the reservations and check in staff have improved.",Fabulousbigapple,2009-11-01,122005,2009-11-28,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Stayed here for my honeymoon” The hotel was in a good location and the rooms were spotless and recently refurbished (massive TV was a nice surprise!). We were a bit disappointed however at queuing for half an hour to check in after having been travelling for 12 hours, and when we finally checked in they couldnt/wouldnt let us have our room early (check in is 3pm, we were there about 2pm) which was a let down because we were shattered and desperate to shower.
The other slight disappointment was that it was our honeymoon and we asked for a nice view which they didnt give us. The check in staff were more interested in flirting with each other than checking us in which annoyed me. 
BUT the rooms were immaculate, the hotel is right next to a subway stop and Ive certainly been in worse rooms. Id recommend this hotel to others but not at full price as I got a good deal and this the price I paid matched what we got.",f_i_o_n_a_86,2009-11-01,122005,2009-11-26,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Location is great, but it is a big hotel and the staff are a bit indifferent” We stayed at this hotel at the beginning and at the end of our trip. 
The first time were stayed for 3 nights and were given a disabled room (although neither of us were disabled). It turned out that the room and the bathroom were fairly large and the only disabled elements seemed to be handrails in the bathroom, so no complaints. The rooms decor is looking a bit tired, although the art deco style is charming. 
This is a large hotel and we did not have much to do with any staff except the check-in who were pretty indifferent towards us - although they were not rude.
The staff on the hotel transportation desk recommended they get us a car to the Airport and this ended up costing us at least double what it should and we felt pretty cheated. On the second stay, we caught the metro to JFK and it cost us about $10 dollars each.. (The transport the hotel arranged cost us closer to $80). 
The second stay was only for 1 night, 7 days later. We were given a standard room and it was very small. The bathroom was so tiny only one person could enter at a time. Again the room was clean, but it would not have been nice to spend more than 1 night there.

Then we went to the room... and guess what?, she gave us the wrong room keys, we went back and the only thing she said was..

We had no issues with size or dirt, in fact the rooms were spotless and well serviced each day by friendly staff. In any case the time we spent in the room was literally for sleeping only as we were out sightseeing all the time! Location was perfect, 10 mins walk to Times square and the Empire State, and diagonally opposite madison square gardens and Penn Station, perfect for us as we were travelling on by train to Boston. We went to the Tick Tock diner every morning for breakfast and it was great, must have put on a stone with all those pancakes!!

We were put into a tiny room and when the smoke started to come in we asked to switch. The unpolite staff then switched us to a room with two tiny beds, big enough to only sleep one person so as a couple we were forced to sleep in separate beds. When asked for a larger bed they said no. We immediately checked out and switched hotels for the remainder of our stay.

"“Good all rounder.........” Having left Las Vegas in temperatures of 102 we couldnt believe that it as only 36 in New York especially as all my research seemed to point to the fact that October is one of the best months to visit New York......... However what helped the pain of the weather was this fab hotel. The central heating / air con worked a treat and the room on the 32nd floor with fab view of Chrysler and Empire state was warm as toast in minutes.
Our room was immaculate with lovely crisp white sheets and comfy beds. Large tv for the morning news report and ample lighting. The bathroom space left a lot to be desired. Two girls on holiday need lots of room for lotions and potions. This was sadly lacking and we were pleased we were only needing the bathroom for 4 days. Immaculate with lots of hot water and fluffy towels but would have loved to spread our potions about. Wardrobe likewise was rather on the small side.
Location is fab with everything you want on your doorstep or a short walk away. The staff were extremley accomodating and helped us out of the rain a few times with our bags. Safes are free of charge but are located in the lobby. Would rather have mine in the room but hey a girl cant have everything. Be prepared to take lots of money to New York as everything costs...... a lot. An average meal in an Italian restaurant on 49th street ( i think) was $200 for four. That was one starter between four , 4 main meals, two deserts and two bottles of wine. Ouch ouch ouch ....... No wonder Macdonalds and starbucks are so popular. ( prefer proper food though )

"“A mixed bag” This is a beautiful hotel in a convenient location, with an excellent diner and restaurant on the ground floor. The beds are firm, the water hot, the cleaners efficient.
That said - the rooms are truly tiny; the staff are variable and there are odd cheap gestures I wouldn't expect from a hotel apparently of this quality - the charge to leave your luggage till your flight, the lack of any bar or room service, the annoying daily cutoff of the free internet service. The bathrooms, to put it politely, are elderly.
I was told that I couldn't change my room, as room type and floor depended on price - yet my travelling companion and I were placed ten floors apart and charged the same. Also, the man who checked us in couldn't seem to get his head round the fact that two men were sharing one room, but it was the solo female who was charging it all to her company card - we had a saga the next day of people being locked out of rooms because he hadn't applied the credit card to both rooms despite clear instructions.

The hotel is in a great location not to far from Times Square we walked there serveral times and there was a lot to see on the way.

Blue and red Subway nearby too. the Hotel is lovely very Art Deco its very clean and the bed was very comfy. It is a huge hotel and is very busy people comming and going all of the time however the rooms were suprisingly quiet! The Tick Tock diner which is attatched to the hotel is great we only had breakfast in there and it was fantastic. It always looked busy however you never had to wait long for a table. Coopers Tarvern which is also attached to the hotel was really nice for a quiet night cap.

-Checked in at about 11, no problem
-Need to show key when entering elevator area
-Hotel definitely has an older feel. Floor I was on had convoluted hallways, not as straightforward as a modern hotel. 
-Soda machine only on certain floors
-I would say the room I was in was definitely on the smaller side, at least compared to the Marriott Marquis. Everything functioned and was clean. 
-Ate at both Coopers and Tick Tock diner (can access both from lobby). Coopers was a fine meal, and would go back again. I had a burger and fries at the diner, and it was probably the worst I've had: fries were dry, burger was dry and way overcooked.

"“Wonderful Art Deco Hotel” Stayed at ""The New Yorker"" from 27th Oct -1st Nov 09 and found it to be exactly as described. The building and furnishings were classic 1930s Art Deco but had been kept up to scratch by a referbishment sometime. The reception staff were swift and efficient ( even though they had no knowledge of my booking) and it only took 5 mins to sort out and I checked in 3 hours earlier than planned.
The room had 2 queens which is the norm Plasma Tv and a bath & shower. We were 28 floors up overlooking MSG.
We didn't bother with the Tick Tock diner for breakfast. Instead we utilised the small kiosk in the lobby which sold croisant ,coffee OJ fruit etc and I took breakfast to my wife in bed every morning which as you can imagine got me several brownie points.
The room was cleaned every day and I would have no hesitation recomending this hotel to friends and will book to stay again.
Also it is centrally located for walking or hoping on the subway.
There is a good bar oposite left of the front door called The Houndstooth and a very good italian ""Marios"" round the corner on 9th+37th",JimNSue50,2009-10-01,122005,2009-11-09,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good comfortable tourist hotel” My partner uses a wheelchair and It is sometimes difficult to get an accessible room - the hotel were helpful before arrival on this aspect and our room was excellent. The hotel is very large and anonymous and the friendliest staff were the security staff. Very centrally located, although not an area for high quality food. I would recommend getting a copy of the Michelin guide for NYC (it doesn't just contain starred restaurants but contains for instance Katz's deli) and you will find good restautants 20-30 minute walks away. The limousine we arranged to meet us fromJFK (via the hotel- for $70) turned out to be an SUV and inaccessible for my partner (despite having pre arranged and spoken to the manager about our needs). So be careful if arranging transport through the hotel. Finally - the free wifi had limited connectivity all the time we were there and to use the internet in the business centre was a dollar a minute!",CaroJane,2009-11-01,122005,2009-11-06,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good, central and comfortable” We stayed at the New Yorker for a week at the end of October 2009. We were on the 27th floor and were impressed by the modern decor and efficient elevators, which were plentiful and fast. The lobby is a marvel in itself (maybe I'm easily pleased) and the location is perhaps the best thing about the place.
Minuses would firstly be the staff on reception. We didn't have much interaction with them, just check-in and check-out really, and on both occasions, they could've been better.
Check-in involved queuing in a very vague line, waiting to catch a staff member's attention rather than be called over. And instead of being welcomed, the member of staff seemed more concerned with outlining the dos and don'ts of the hotel, essentially reading the rulebook to us.
Our room was quite small, but within NYC norms by all accounts. All furnishings and fixtures were impressive, as was the bed and TV. The shower, however, required extensive adjustment to get any temperature resembling bearable. My wife simply gave up on it, as it veered from freezing cold to boiling hot with the tiniest movement of the tap.
We didn't eat at the hotel per se but we did try the hotel's Tick Tock Diner. While its finish seemed very authentic (we're big diner fans), the staff were again abrupt and more than a little world-weary and the food varied from ok (Denver Omelette) to not good (pancakes) to downright awful (the iced water, admittedly not really the hotel's fault!). We also tried the Skylight Diner nearby but neither came close to the Comfort Diner on East 45th St, which is well worth the walk.
Funnily enough, the security staff were about the friendliest employees at the hotel. We got some pointers on good places to eat from one lady at the security desk and those checking for room keys at the elevators always had a smile. 
The hotel arranged seats for us on a bus to Newark Airport (€27 each) but fumbled a little in the execution of it, seemingly sending one bus to Newark with one couple on it and leaving the rest of us behind - apparently they had reached the NJ side of the Lincoln Tunnel before turning back. Then we were nearly sent on the wrong bus (to JFK). I really got the impression the staff were a little lazy in this aspect of their job.
Overall, however, I'd love to return to the New Yorker. We had a very comfortable 7 nights there, the cleaning staff were in and out any day we wanted and left our room immaculate, showing a pride in their work clearly lacking amongst other (possibly better-paid) members of staff, the location is, as I've said, just about perfect and the facilities seem pretty good. 
One final note - we saw on the back of our door that the room rate is €299 to €499 per night and I spoke briefly with another guest in the elevator who had paid this much. Having paid much less than this, I would certainly not consider this hotel to be worth such a rate and I hope guests are paying significantly less than this in reality.Great",Joe835,2009-10-01,122005,2009-11-03,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Took 2 and a half hours in busy traffic with NYC traffic police closing off random streets in an attempt to keep traffic moving, however making it difficult to leave Manhatten.

"“Fantastic Hotel & Location” Great Hotel in a great location for exploring the city. After disembarking our Aircraft at 1.30 pm, we arrived at this hotel by 2.30pm (using NJ Transit from Newark) less than an hour!
Reception staff friendly and efficient, our room was not yet ready so did all the preliminaries, and the receptionist told us to come back at 3.00 for our key and to jump the queue and go straight to her to collect the key. Information desk printed our boarding cards for our return again very friendly Guy on the desk.
We had a beer in Coopers Tavern, the hotel bar whilst waiting and unlike the previous reviewer (perhaps they were overcharged?) we found that the beer charged at $4.50 was cheap particularly if you compare to central London and even our own local pub. We had a drink there a couple of times either before going out of an evening and or on our return, pleasant place and nice friendly atmosphere
Room was a good size for a city hotel, nicely furnished with 'period' Art Deco style fittings and very clean and fresh, this daily maid service did a very good job. In fact the entire hotel was kept clean and tidy.
The lobby is quite impressive especially if you like the Art Deco period (of which i am a great fan) and the refurbishment that has been completed to bring the Hotel back to its former glories is impressive.
This is a great position for a hotel to explore the city, a subway station immediately outside, Penn Station over the road. Empire State building less than 10 mins ways (passing Macy's to get there). We walked to Times square again 10 mins.
There are not really any decent restaurants in the immediate vicinity unless you like chains (TGI Friday opposite) but a Taxi is so cheap you can get any where reasonably and the Subway is $2 a ride so you don't need to eat near here if you don't want to do that just walk as you are close enough to most things.
There are a couple of good deli's on 38th we used for Breakfast although you can use the Tick Tock Diner, or the hotel sells coffee and pastries in the lobby
So to summarise, great location, great value, great hotel.",Topsy130,2009-10-01,122005,2009-10-27,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great value and location!” Just arrived back from the New Yorker today. There are sooo many hotels to choose from in NYC, and to read all of the reviews would take forever. I asked a friend who goes to NY fairly often where she recommended we stay, and she asked ""do you want a reasonable, clean hotel in a good location?"" and recommended the NY'er. She was right. We booked our trip through Travelocity and had no problems at all. I travelled with my mom, and on Travelocity, the only room choice available at the time of booking was a queen bed, which we could have dealt with, but when we arrived they asked if we wanted two double beds and gave that to us with no additional charge, although when I called the previous day and asked about ti they said it would cost an extra $50 per night, but we got it for nothing. 
The hotel has been renovated recently. We thought the room was a fine size for NY, a little tight, but not super small. It was fine for the two of us. The room looked newly painted, the beds were very comfy, with lots of pillows, and it was clean. The bathroom could have used a little updating, but was clean and everything worked fine. We did not have a great view from our room. but that was ok with us, as were weren't there much to enjoy it anyway. 
We did not try Coopers Tavern, but did get desserts from the 24 hour Tick Tock Diner off the lobby. They were reasonable and great for a late night sweet tooth! Starbucks across the street if you're a die hard for it. But also coffee in the lobby (to buy, not complimentary). No coffee maker in our room. 
Within walking distance of Times Square (about 8 blocks), Macy's, Empire State Buiding. 
Free safe deposit boxes for your valuables in the lobby. 
If I went back to NY, I would definitely stay here again.",luvsmexico,2009-10-01,122005,2009-10-25,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“An OK hotel” Location wise the hotel can't really be faulted, only 5 mins from Time Square. This did have the negatives however of the local neighborhood being very pricey to eat in etc compared with other areas but it was nice being so central. 
The hotel was OK - it is a huge hotel so not especially personal and not very friendly, but not downright rude either. Our room was small but clean, big enough for what we wanted but didn't have any ""wow"" factor. It was tastefully decorated and quiet. The bar was very expensive (this did reflect prices locally) we were charged $18 for a glass of wine and a bottle of beer in happy hour, so beware of that. Tick Tock diner was very nice with large portions but was also expensive at about $15 for breakfast - I'd recommend walking about 5 mins away from Time square to eat similar foods for half the price.
We had a fantastic time in NY but next time would pay slightly more and stay somewhere more upmarket or pay the same for somewhere more personal a little further from the centre.",Twizooo,2009-09-01,122005,2009-10-25,False,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“A real feel of Classic New York” Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in September for what was my first ever visit to New York City. As it was a trip I had been very keen to do for some time, I had high expectations for the visit, and staying here really added to the experience. This was due to the decor of the building, with obvious influence from the Art Deco era when the hotel was initially built. The bedroom appeared fresh, with a few nice features to act as a reminder of the hotel's history.
Although we only paid for a Metro Room, we were upgraded upon arrival to a City View room on the 27th floor, which was greatly appreciated and gave us a fabulous view of the Empire State from our window, and also the Chrysler. One thing which was particularly good is that the room was quite quiet considering it was in the middle of Manhattan, and given how busy the city is, it was nice to be able to retreat back to a peaceful room at the end of the day (though you could still hear the sirens etc sometimes). The location was also good, with the Empire State, Macy's and Times Square all within easy reach on foot.
We found the staff to be friendly and polite, and I would also recommend the Tick-Tock diner which is situated on the Ground Floor of the hotel.
I would definitely stay here again if I was to return to New York City.",birdseye77,2009-09-01,122005,2009-10-24,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE NEW YORKER” We have just returned from our second trip to New York in nine months and would highly recommend the New Yorker.
We loved everything about the hotel, from the minute we walked into the Reception area.
The Art Decor style is really nice, from the chandelier in Reception, to the lifts, the corridors and our room.
Our room was on 33rd Floor with a fantastic view of the city, it was wonderful to see everything lit up after dark.
The room was refurbished, quite small but with enough room for both of us. The bathroom was clean and a decent size. We could hear neighbouring rooms toilets flush and their shower as mentioned before. The air con/central heating was useful as we had a mixed bag of weather.
The location also scores top marks with us, Macys is at the end of the street with the Empire State Building on the next block. Times Square is a few minutes walk away and Maddison Square Garden directly opposite.
The hotels 24 hour diner - Tick Tock was also very nice, as well as popular, there were often queues at breakfast time!
The staff were very helpful, it was a good idea to have to show your room card before you could enter the lift as there was always a lot of people milling about.
We were able to store our luggage with the bell boy on our last day, however we had to pay $3 for two suitcases and a backpack.
One word of warning, when arriving at JFK we were approached by a man asking if we wanted a taxi, when I asked the cost, he said I have a table in the car to show you - it all seemed genuine enough. He then proceeded to take us past the row of yellow cabs into a nearby multi storey, we realised then, this was not a licensed, genuine taxi driver.
He then got a printed brouchure from his car and showed us that a midtown hotel would be $90 plus toll and tip. This was our excuse to get away. When we joined the yellow cab queue there was a group of these unlicensed men approaching people. Our genuine yellow cab was a set fee of £45 plus toll and tip.

Extremely comfortable stay!” We've stayed here for our last 3 trips to NYC, on this occasion for a total of 4 nights on 3 separate mini-visits to the City (6th, 14th/15th and 18th October) in 3 different rooms - all excellent. Our last night was in room 3520 - excellent view of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings (while lying in bed - how cool is that?), but the smallest of the 3 rooms. The largest room (2 queen beds) was 2938, with a similar view from windows at the side. And our first night (after our flight from London) was on the 22nd floor, with a 'standard' view of NY rooftops and water tanks. All 3 rooms were perfectly clean, with excellent beds, an abundance of good lighting (definitely better than anywhere else we've stayed in New York or London), free wifi, flatscreen TVs, pleasant toiletries... Unlike our previous visits, our experience this time was of a hotel that's been freshly decorated and extremely well maintained. The only 'negative' is the (unexpected) sound of plumbing from adjacent rooms, as mentioned by another recent reviewer.
Staff were very friendly and helpful, and it's worth noting that after checkout you can leave your bags ($1 per bag for the day; $2 per bag per overnight if you'll be returning to the hotel in a couple of days as we did) - very useful as there are no longer any bag check facilties/lockers in Penn Station.",lucdigital,2009-10-01,122005,2009-10-20,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Very almost there...” My husband and I stayed at the New Yorker this week, for one night. This was our first visit to NY, the last night of a week in New England. The hotel is beautiful, the room was lovely, we were upgraded to a city view room because of an extra payment we made on booking, overlooking Madison Square Garden, the Empire State and the Chrysler Building. The design of the room and bathroom is beautiful art deco, and was perfectly clean. When we arrived to check in we were early but told to return at 1pm. At 1pm our room still wasn't ready so we ended up waiting in the lobby for half an hour. This was slightly annoying as we were happy to leave luggage, and only went back to check in because we were told the room would be ready, otherwise we'd not have wasted that time waiting. New York is amazing, and after a long afternoon sight seeing we went to bed at about midnight, but had a terrible night's sleep, partly because we had been on the go for so long, but partly because all noise from the corridors sounded as if it was happening in our room, it was so noisy. Also when the bathroom was used next door, the water pipes sounded very loud in our room. I appreciate that the hotel is old (1929) but we expected a quieter experience. The hotel is lovely, and perhaps we were unlucky to have inconsiderate floor mates who thought rooms were sound proofed, but next time we go to NY we will either stay somewhere more modern, hoping for better sound proofing, or outside of Manhattan. Public transport is so easy to use so travelling in from Brooklyn for example would be no issue. I would not automatically stay here again, but wouldn't avoid it. We would recommend the hotel to a friend as it was lovely, but warn that some rooms may be noisy like ours.

"“Would definitely stay here again” 4th visit in NYC; stayed at Red Roof Inn (RRI) 2 previous times but rates there have significantly increased. Booked the New Yorker at a cheaper rate than RRI (Travelocity special), same area of Manhattan but far nicer amenities. Completely renovated and refurbished Art Deco hotel with history. Rooms are good size for New York. Bathrooms are clean and fair sized (however, little room to place toiletries). Bed is very comfortable (I haven't experienced this in a hotel in a long time) though there is some noise outside at night (frequent police and other sirens). The free internet is surprisingly fast.

Tips, watch out for service charges, from what i gathered this includes the tip so you dont have to pay if your not happy with your service.

We got very good rates at 1800 hotels. Upon check in the very pleasant receptionist upgraded us to a suite and it really was lovely. Spacious and quiet! The location is great and the diner was good for a quick bite. Only downside was that check in and check out at reception was very slow due to the high level of business.

"“Excellent Hotel, Great Location” Just returned from New York after staying 4 nights with my friend.We flew into Newark and got a yellow cab to the Hotel, but returned to airport in one of the Hotels executive cars which cost us the same price as the yellowcab but much more stylish just book with Consierge in reception.On arrival check in was very easy and greeted by Mohammed who was very nice and friendly , we were given a free upgrade in a room on the 37th Floor fantastic views over the city and the Empire State Building.the only problem with this is that your ears pop after about floor 32 and it takes a few hours to get used to the altitude.Location is great just 1 block from Macys, times square 10 - 15 minutes walk, central park 25 mins walk.My friend and I walked for miles and miles but there is so much to see en route you dont even notice.This city is fantastic if you are doing all of the touristy things invest in a new york city pass before you go , we paid £110 dollars each , collected them from Planet Hollywood in Times Square ,and you get free entry into over 50 attractions and miss out on some of the queues as it works like a fast pass, empire state, rockerfeller centre, statue of liberty, madame tussauds definately worth the money.We used the tick tock diner every morning for breakfast and although I am a bit of a tea and toast girl first thing the cooked breakfast looked really nice.We also came back here a couple of nights and the food was very nice and staff very friendly.Highlights for us were Statue of Liberty, empire state building at night, shopping (Tiffanys, Macys, Bloomingdales) and we also booked Sex in the City tour which is highly recommended if you are a fan of the show , you see all the locations, eat cupcakes from the Magnolia Bakery (which were to die for) and 2 or 3 Cosmopolitans in Steves bar in the afternoon, life doesnt get any better.Cant wait to return",CHJD,2009-09-01,122005,2009-10-08,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

We had a wonderful view of the Empire State Building and The Crysler Buidling from our room. The only downfall during my stay at the New Yorker was the dinging of the elevator reaching the floor-our room was right by the elevator. The Tic Toc diner was good and not that expensive. All of the chain resturants in the area jack up their prices so don't be alarmed. Do some research for resturants prior to coming. It was a challenge to find a great resturant in mid town.

"“Never Again” I just spent two nights (of three prepaid nights) at The New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan. Considering the price people probably wonder why leave early. Well, I entered my room after checking in and was a little disappointed with the size but oh well it's Manhattan. What I didn't expect was to share my room with the largest cockroach I've ever seen in my life. I immediately called housekeeping, and after hearing that I had a cockroach in my room, the housekeeping manager herself came upstairs and they of course moved me into another room. While she was very friendly I still cut my stay as short as possible and would never stay there again. Cockroaches don't travel alone - where there is one, there are many. And Hotel management didn't do anything to make this up to me. No apology, no upgrade to a nicer room, which makes me wonder if they are used to it ...",Anusch,2009-10-01,122005,2009-10-06,False,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Pleasantly Surprised” My mum booked this hotel as part of a package trip and when I checked reviews on tripadvisor I was not expecting much, but it was excellent. The location is great for getting around, there is a subway station (Penn Station 34th Street) right next door which runs on the C & E line right down to the World Trade Centre Site and all up the west side of Central Park (you can also get the A train but this is the express and doesn't do all the stops on the way - as I found out too late when we carried on past 72nd Street where I wanted to stop!) The Empire State Building is a couple of blocks away, Times Square is within a 10 minute walk, Macy's and major clothes stores are within a few minutes walk on 7th Avenue and it's easy to walk downtown to Chelsea, Union Square etc. 
Our room was fantastic - I had managed to blag an upgrade for my mums birthday - and was spacious, modern and clean with a good sized bathroom with bath and shower, a huge TV with sattelite channels, a desk and armchairs. One small gripe was that I tried to have a shower in the evening and the water was cold, it was about 9.30pm though and other evening swhen I was a little earlier were no problem. We were lucky to have a room looking directly onto the Empire State Building, quite impressive to wake up and fall asleep looking at! The check-in girl that served me was immensely helpful, polite and friendly and all the other staff and belboys we encountered were the same (3 of them even passing around a bottle of wine we couldn't uncork until someone managed too do it) and we were pleasantly surprised that they weren't expecting tips - with the belboys we had the money in our hand but the just got on with their job and didn't hang around expectantly.
There are no tea/coffee facilities in the room but there is a diner next door, McDonalds across the road, Starbucks around the corner and lots of other fast food places and convenience stores, with most offering hot food and drinks to have in or take away. The only letdown of the location for me was the availability of good food: if you love fast food you'll be spoilt for choice but if you prefer fresher, less greasy, healthier options you will have to go a little further afield, especially for breakfast and dinner. The hotel restaurant, Coopers, is ok but does have quite a limited menu. For lunch and light breakfasts (croissants/pastries/French toast) and good coffee there is a Dean & Deluca five minutes walk away, heading towards 7th, on the ground floor of the New York Times Building which has fantastic sandwiches, snacks, cakes, cappucinos and hot chocolate!
To sum up, I would definitely recommend the New Yorker to anyone that wanted to have easy access to the main sightseeing musts of NYC but I would recommend that you asked for a room above the 20th floor - we were on the 32nd and had no problem with noise but I had seen reviews where people had complained about street noise. Now that I've seen the sights though I would choose to stay in Greenwich Village which is less busy and has a less crazy vibe. The New Yorker is great for seeing the sights and being central but it isn't in the best area and the surrounding area is very busy, but I always felt safe and found it easy to get back to and there were always cabs around too if you don't fancy the subway, although it is easy to use.",SamThailand,2009-10-01,122005,2009-10-06,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great hotel in a great location” I stayed in the new yorker for 3 nights at the end of september with my partner.

We went up to our room and the corridors are a bit drab but our room was perfect for our trip, it was clean, colourful and comfortable and had a large bed.

"“Fantastic Hotel. Great views” I took my partner to New York as a surprise for her 30th birthday. I obviously wanted everything to be perfect, and it was.
I took a lot of time reading reviews of the many hotels in New York and finally decided on the New Yorker. All of the hotels seem to have mixed reviews, I suppose it's everyone's personal experiences.
My experience of the New Yorker was extremely good. I booked the holiday and then emailed the hotel directly to upgrade to a city view room. The hotel were very helpful and responded to all my requests prompty.
We arrived at the hotel at around 1pm. The room check in was from 3pm, however there was no issue with this and we were checked in immediately. We were also upgraded further to a tower room for just the cost of the city view upgrade that I had already requested. The room was on the 39th floor and the views were fantastic, down to the financial district and the statue of liberty (which you could just about see :o).
The room was a good size, presumably as we had been given a tower room, not sure what the standard rooms were like. The room was probably what you would usually get at other vacation spots but was probably bigger than usual for New York judging by other reviews. The room was clean and comfortable.
We had a fridge in the room which had some cans of pop and water when we arrived. These didn't get replaced, but I couldn't really complain as we'd been upgraded at no extra charge anyway. I then realised, with all of the excitement that I had forgotten to tip the cleaner so left a tip, surprise, surprise the fridge then magically was re-stocked :o).
The location was pretty good although I think staying closer to Central Park or Times Square would have been a bit easier on the feet :o)
Overall I was very pleased with the hotel. The location was good the staff were very helpful and friendly and I would be more than happy to stay there again.
General New York tips:
Don't forget to tip, 15 - 20% is usual.
Plan what you want to do as there is soooooooo much to do, you won't fit it all in.
Do the tourist stuff - you won't regret it.
Don't go to ""21 Club"" resturant, I've never been to such a pretentious boys club in my life. As soon as we got there we both just wanted to leave. It's dark, dingy, the food is over priced and average at best. Most of the staff seem to walk round with their head up their own rear ends.
I took my partner on the World Yacht Dinner cruise for her birthday. I was a bit worried that it may be a bit cheesy and overpriced, but it was one of the best nights of my life. Great food. Great atmosphere, fantastic sights - A must do in my opinion, worth every penny.

"“There is nothing to fault with this hotel...” ... at least in the context of where it is. A mid-town Manhattan hotel, across the road from Madison Square Garden and one block away from Macy's is about as good a location as you can get for a New York city break. The down-side to that is you are occupying some very expensive real estate, so don't expect 'big'. With that expectation in check, our room was a very pleasant surprise. A 'queen' room on the 33 floor at the back of the property, yes it was small, but perfectly functional. The hotel revels in its Art Deco history, and the decor of the room continues this very well. But for the flat screen tv and free WiFi, one could imagine yourself back in the 1930s - though I stress that the furnishings are new, clean and very comfortable.
This is a constantly busy property with a lot of comings and goings, and is in the centre of THE major metropolitan area. However, we found our entire five night stay to be reasonably peaceful, with only the occasional siren penetrating our sleep. Oh, and the murder one block away on Sunday evening was surely just an aberration and not something to hold against the hotel!

"“Brilliant Location - I Love NY” As we drove from Newark airport to the hotel you couldn't miss it. A very large building with a massive sign saying ""NEW YORKER"". 
My friend and I were very excited about visiting New York and couldn't wait to get to our room as we had been up graded thanks to our brilliant Travel Counsellor Saranna, we were going to get a city view with double double beds and thats exactly what we got. We were on the 34th floor with amazing views of the city and a clear view of the Empire State building which changed colour at night. Housekeeping was great, they even do an eco-friendly scheme where they encourage you to re-use your towels to save on washing.
Unfortunately the only downfall was when we went to check-in...our room was not ready on time and we had to wait half an hour. I went over to ask if it was ready and she had forgotten about us and we werent the only ones forgotten about. Guests behind me had been waiting for an hour so im lucky that I went over to find out. When our room was finally ready the moody receptionist asked for my credit card ( i don't own one) I told her this and then I can give her my debit card but she wouldnt allow it. Then she demanded cash as a pre-auth. As a student I only had enough cash for the entire holiday. My friend and I were really disheartened as we were so excited to be there then this receptionist put us on a downer! I gave her $300 and eventually got it back at the end of my holiday.
The location was brilliant. You could not ask for a better location. On the groud floor there is a Tick Tock diner which serves chocolate pancakes, yummy milkshakes and burgers. We visited the diner most days. The other restaurant we did not visit as it was a bit more expensive. The Empire State Building is a 10 minute walk, Macy's is 6 minute walk, Times Square is a 15 minute walk. Taxi's are really cheap compared to London. A taxi from the hotel to Staten Island Ferry was only $14. The hotel toilets were clean unlike the ones at Newark Aiport. We did not use the gym or the business centre but both looked fine. There is a gift shop also. Across the road from the hotel is everything you need. There is a McDonalds which is open 24hours, clothes shop, train station, TGI's, electronic store, bank etc.
We went on a bike from the Rockerfeller Centre to the hotel which was only $20 and was well worth it, was a right laugh. I definately recommend going to the top of the Rockerfeller Centre, it was $20 but there is a guy walking around the bottom giving out coupons for $2 off each ticket. When you get to the top there is a 360' view of the city and you can see for miles. The views were amazing and is definately a must see! 
My friend and I went to see Mary Poppins in theatre which was fantastic and was $60 for the cheapest ticket which we bought from the information centre in Times Square, if you want even cheaper tickets in the middle of Times Square there is a stand called ""TKTS"" where on the day you can get half price tickets but its a long wait. 
Abercrombie and Fitch store in 5th Avenue has the hottest staff and you can get your picture taken by a very good looking male model! 5th Avenue has expensive shops but if you prefer somewhere with a bit of both go to Soho.
If your looking to go clubbing I recommend going to the Meat Packing District but try and get on the guest list as we waited an hour on a Saturday night to get in a club and we still could not get in! We went to a comedy club one evening which was absolutely hilarious and would encourage anyone to go, only $10 and they sell these tickets in Times Square. $40 dollars for a horse and cart ride round Central Park which was relaxing.
Definately go and see the Statue of Liberty but go on the Staten Island Ferry which goes every half hour and takes 25minutes and its free! Walk over Brooklynn bridge just before the sunsets which has spectacular views.

"“You must stay here !!!!” My daughter and I have just returned from New York and had the pleasure of staying in the New Yorker Hotel on 8th Avenue. It was the first time either of us had been to New York and on arrival at the hotel we were very impressed to say the least. It is billed as Art Deco and that's just what it is. It's nice to see that not every hotel has to look ""super modern"". The lobby is amazing and if you get chance just grab a seat and people watch. We were on 25th floor and were very pleased with the room. We had 2 large beds which were extremely comfortable and plenty of pillows ( something most european hotels could do with providing ! ) and clean crisp white sheets. The bathroom was large and had a bath as well as a shower and was spotless. Everything about the room was so clean and welcoming. Our room was on the front of the building but in an alcove so we had a view but were shielded from trafffic noise. Having said that I have to say it was one of the quietest hotels I have ever stayed in. The cleaning staff were unobtrusive and very friendly as were all the staff at the hotel. The Tick Tock diner which is joined onto the hotel is really great. I'd read it was expensive but I have to say I've paid more in England and I didn't get the quantity or quality of food we had here. (Try the deserts !!) There is also a restaurant attached called Coopers but we didn't try that as we were working our way down the Diner menu!!! 
Location is superb. Macy's, The Empire State Building, Times Square and the Rockefeller Centre all withing easy walking distance and 2 subway stations really close to the hotel will take you all over Manhattan. We booked our holiday through Let'sgoto.com and I would recommend this company as they sorted everything brilliantly. If you're looking for a great hotel that won't break the bank this is the place for you. My daughter is already making plans to return to New York and this hotel is definitely where she wants to stay. Thanks to all at the New Yorker for making it such a great holiday.",artisanSheffield,2009-08-01,122005,2009-09-30,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Rooms very clean, we were on 29th floor so no problems with traffic noise. Bed very comfortable and clean linen. Maid service excellent. We visited the Tick Tock diner, which is just next door, every morning - great food, large portions and we thought excellent value for money... set us up for the day before we visited all the different sights! Empire State Building only 15mins walk from the hotel, similar time to Times Square and Broadway. Macys only 5 mins walk! Staff were very friendly.

"“Nice Hotel at an OK Price” Great location near Madison Sq. Garden / Penn Station made it easy to get around the City. Hotel was bustling and check-in line moved quickly. Room was a OK-sized for NYC, but bed was short to save space. If you're over 6' tall, your feet will be hanging off the end. Furniture and amenities were very nice. Bathroom did not have enough shelf space, just a 4"" strip below the mirror and above the pedestal sink. OK for the single traveler, but it'll be a challenge for a couple (or family).
Lobby area was nice, comfortable and good for people-watching. Clerk named Mohammed was especially helpful.",Ephman85,2009-08-01,122005,2009-09-25,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent Hotel” Check in at this Hotel went very smooth and the reception staff were very polite and the maids. Although our room was very small it was clean and the decor was nice. The view from my room was the Empire State Building and we could see the top of the Chrysler Building. The beds were very comfortable. The aircon in the room was great as it was very humid whilst we were there. 
The Hotel has a free gym but to be honest it wasn't good with old tired machines. The treadmill was very noisy but was the only thing that really worked. The weight machine were stuck at a particular weight so i couldn't lift them. I think the Hotel need to spend as little money and upgrade the gym.
The Hotel has free Wi-fi so this is excellent if you want to bring your laptop.
We didn't have breakfast at the Hotel so i wouldn't know what it was like, however we did go to the Tick Tock diner located downstairs in the Hotel. The food was ok with very very big portions, the salad we had was enough for four people!!
The location of this Hotel is fantastic because it it next to madison Square Gardens, Macy's, The Empire State Building. It's also a 5 minute walk to Times Square. Port Authority Bus Station is also 5 minutes away so it handy for when you want to take the bus to Woodbury Common Shopping Oulet or even the transfer bus to Newark airport.
I really liked this Hotel and i would definately stay here again due to the location.",brownsuga,2009-08-01,122005,2009-09-25,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Fabulous stay at The New Yorker Hotel” Stayed in the hotel in Sept 09. Rooms were absolutely great and LARGE by NYC standards. Loved the art deco feel of the hotel, and the new renovations and refurbishment keeps the theme. The hallways and rooms were spotlessly clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The elevators were great - no wait time at all! That can sometimes be a real problem in other hotels we've stayed in in NYC. Beds were very comfortable and linens were new and fresh. Bathroom had a hairdryer. Closet size was small but certainly adequate for two people's week's worth of clothes. My advice is don't overpack - amazed at the size of suitcases some people drag along with them! There are stores within two minutes' walking distance where you can buy anything you may need - be it toiletries or clothing. (Example, if you just want some cheap threads, right around the corner is a Conway store where you can get an entire outfit for about $10.) The location of hotel is very convenient to two subway lines as well as the train and bus station. Quite a few restaurants in the area, including fast food if you want a quick bite. If your stomach can handle it, suggest you go two blocks down to the Gray's Papaya for ""The Recession Special"" - two hot dogs and a drink for $4! The business center in the hotel has a few computers and one or two printers. Workout room was nothing spectacular but who needs it after walking around all day. Would highly recommend a stay at The New Yorker and hope to be a guest there again myself someday.",2Travelers2go,2009-09-01,122005,2009-09-21,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location, small but good rooms” Location is spot on - directly opposite Penn Station and about 10-15mins walk to Times Square. Getting to the hotel from the airport was easy, using the airtrain between JFK and Jamaica and then the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) from Jamaica to Penn Station - cost about $18, took about 45 mins. Our room was fairly small, but perfectly adequate for a trip where we spent most of our time out seeing the city. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Glad for the air con in the room as there was a heat wave during our visit! Pretty good value considering the hotel location, but the room was pretty small for the price. The Tick Tock diner in the hotel is a must, serving great breakfasts by very friendly staff.",Marty1181,2009-08-01,122005,2009-09-13,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Stay” We stayed here and didn't really have any problems. The lady at check-in wasn't very friendly but the security guy's made up for that, and were always more than helpful when we asked them questions about the area and where to go at night-they couldn't have been any friendlier to us. As 3 twenty-something girls we always felt safe in the area-and we couldn't complain about the loaction...only a 10 min walk to times square! It was very central and had metro stops just outside. 
The room was modern and very clean. In fact, the maid was fantastic...our room was horribley messy and she even tidied up mess that had been dumped everywhere-never had a better maid!
We couldn't really comment on the food in the diner as we didnt eat there...we were in NY, and was out of the hotel the majority of the time. 
One thing...don't buy a hotel phone card if you are planning to call the UK...it didnt work and took all the money off.

"“Best Hotel so far for the price!” This was our third trip to NYC and our third different hotel and each time the hotel has topped the previous one.
We arrived in New York at JFK airport and took a yellow taxi directly to the New Yorker. Air train does come into Penn Station close to this hotel but as there were 4 of us in total and l didnt want my parents to lug their cases about, taxi was the easiest and cheapest option-$45 plus tip and toll so $55 total.
Check in was quick and easy and the lady gave us a few directions and told us about the diner and restaurant.
Our rooms were located next to each other as requested and were on the 19th floor. No view which a little disappointing as you can see the Empire State building from some rooms but it wasnt the end of the world for us. The room was newly decorated and very clean. Having read reviews on the site regarding bugs l checked the room thoroughly just for peace of mind! I didnt find anything. Yes the room was small but it had everything we needed including flat screen tv, hairdryer, storage space and even a bath which we have never had in a NYC city hotel before!
We ate breakfast in the Tick Tock diner every morning as it was very convienient and my parents needed breakfast. It was more expensive than other places but the food was good, portions large, staff friendly and VERY hard working and so much easier than leaving the hotel. Whilst the hotel is centrally located it is not close to any one land mark, whilst this was ok for us it did mean a bit of a walk but subway stations and taxis and close to hand. We had previously stayed at Hotel Pennsivania and Milford Plaza, the New Yorker is the best for quality of hotel but the location of Milford Plaza was more central to Times Square. 
I have read the reviews on here placed by people who stayed there at the same time as us and there are some very different stories!
Overall l would say, you get what you pay for and never expect a cheap New York hotel room to be much bigger than room to walk around the bed! If you are going to New York to shop and sightsee then these hotels are great, if you are going to spend a lot of time in your room you need to pay more. We personally only use our rooms as a base and spend our time out and about.

"“Great location, sophisticated and great breakfast diner” I thought this hotel was great. 
Its a big art deco style hotel with impressive reception hall and express lifts to floors 20 and beyond. We were on the 20th floor and while we didn't have much of a view it was a very good price for New York and we had 2 rooms (single rooms) I went with my Mother.
These rooms had a fairly large queen size bed I would say and nice touches like the art deco lights, furniture and bathroom fixtures. Also had nice HD plasma tv's and alarm clocks and nice sheets and duvet.
Location was great - I could see the 34th St Penn Station subway from my room, directly under us and this station served the A, C and E line train (all of which take you right out to near the airport and the airtrain for JFK airport)
A block away is another Penn St station subway which serves the 1,2 and 3 lines - taking you to the Staten Island Ferry, Times Square and West side of Central Park.
But you don't need a subway to walk to Times Square from here... its only a 10 minute walk and the Empire State building is only a 10 minute walk also. If you were going to Madison Square gardens for an event this would probably be the best hotel for you as it is just across the road. 
New York is quite noisy with sirens and hooting but the air con was great and the windows were closed and by later in the evening the traffic had died down and I didn't get disturbed by the noise while sleeping.
The hotel has a diner attached called the Tick Tock diner which is 24 hours and serve the greatest breakfasts! massive portions and although I have seen people complaining that they were expensive I didn't really think that was the case - compared to other places in New York.. New York is just expensive to eat I think. 
Hotel staff were okay - nothing special, they checked us in and checked us out with minmal effort but they were busy and the security staff by the lifts were friendly. 
All in all for the price I paid for 2 rooms I wouldn't have got the price of 1 room in some hotels so I was satisfied with what I paid and the standard of this hotel and location. 
I plan on going back to NY with my husband and would have no hesitation in going back to the New Yorker Hotel.",clarems,2009-09-01,122005,2009-09-09,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Very Rude Staff and a mouse” The begining of our stay was actually nice, then we came ba0ck to our room to find a bag of pretzels and chocolate nibbled to pieces. Called the manager was put to voice mail, called the operater and was disconnected! After my third call I got the security manager who called the manager for us. Very strange young man ( I didn't get a name!!!!) asked me a number of questions regarding the condition of the bag, moved our room. Upgraded, thats a joke the room was 2x2 with a bathroom thats shelf is maybe 2 inches wide and some crappy breakfast ( I don't even think the mouse would eat it and thats why it ate our chocolates and pretzels ) We probably would have been okay with it had it been handled diffrently, it was almost as if we were bothering the managers by bringing this to their attention. I am no way a seasoned travler but have stayed in a fair share of moderate to high end places and this was just a bad bad experience.

"“poor service” We didn't expect that the room booked with Priceline will have only one queen bed. We wanted to check if this matter could be somehow solved with the manager. But the manager at the hotel, Mr.Rowan Bechford, was arrogant, unfriendly and impolite. When I tried to explain him the situation he didn't want to listen to me, interrupted me for several times, not letting me complete my phrase and his facial expression showed total disdain and uppity. Another guy at the reception desk out of the blue started to make fun out of my sun glasses, making unpleasant jokes and comments. I don't allow such familiriaties with people whom I meet for the first time. I am not the US citizen and my English isn't flawless.

"“Great if you're travelling via Penn Station” My husband and I were travelling down the East Coast of the US by train - we arrived in Penn Station from Boston. Three days later we left by train from Penn Station to Atlantic City. I chose the New Yorker mainly because it is very close to Penn Station, therefore not far to carry our bags. I was right to do so - it was very conveniently located for the station, so I was pleased with my choice.
This was my second time sightseeing in New York, last time we stayed further uptown. Staying midtown was OK, if you don't mind a bit of a walk (say 15/20 minutes walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center etc). The subway was very convenient for getting downtown e.g. to the Status of Liberty. If we hadn't been travelling by train, I think I would have preferred to stay further uptown.
Breakfast in the diner was OK, but very busy. One morning there were some unpleasant people arguing at the table next to us. The bar was very good for drinks - very friendly. We didn't eat in the bar but they did serve food.
The service in the hotel wasn't good (pretty rude staff at check-in). Our room, on the 34th floor, was very small and the bathroom was a bit nasty.

For getting around a Metro pass purchased from the subway station was a great buy $27 for a 7 day unlimited pass, can be used on the subway and the buses we went to so many more places because of this pass.

After a days sightseeing we like to unwind with a couple of glasses of wine in the bar and take a glass to our room to finish off the day, no problem in other hotels, but here were told no glasses were allowed in the rooms and were offered Macdonald style paper cups for our wine, not exactly classy, on top of which the tips are put on the bill by the barstaff that run at 18%, its not worth it for that service, unlike other hotels, we were charged for leaving baggage with the porter on checkout.

Bad: 
Noisy, very noisy. Rooms are small (given for NY I know but I was told this place was recently rennovated? The paint jobs were botchy). When i turned on the hot water in the shower I never had to put on the cold water because the hot tap was sending me luke warm water! also the nozzle was spraying all over the bathroom (Why didn't they update the bathrooms?)

"“Location, location, location” Finding decent, reasonably priced accommodation in New York City is a challenge. It's a case of pot luck or recommendations from friends.
Thankfully The New Yorker was the latter and we were not disappointed.
Situated on 7th Ave and 35th St, just seven blocks south of Times Square and three blocks west of the Empire State Building, the New Yorker is a fantastic hotel base for your city adventure.
It's an Art Deco classic both inside and out, offers over 900 rooms and all the amenities you would expect as part of the Ramada chain.
We had a twin room and although it was a little tight to get two double beds into the room, we were comfortable and more importantly the room was clean and modern. Nice flat screen TV and incredibly deep bath, too.
The Tick Tock diner (attached) is a little pricey although certainly worth trying a tleast once for breakfast. It cost $1 per item to leave our luggage at the hotel once we'd checked out which I thought was pretty reasonable for NYC.
Getting to the hotel from JFK/La Guardia is pretty straight forward . We took the Port Authority run Airport transfer shuttle to Penn Station - the hotel is one block north of here. Shuttle was $12.
We got a cab from the hotel to JFK and it was $50 which were advised is the standard airport rate.",cakeybees,2009-08-01,122005,2009-08-24,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location - super value!!” The room was very small, but my husband and I were super pleased with the location, the cleanliness of the hotel, and the demeanor of the staff. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an inexpensive, no frills, clean place to stay. The location was awesome. There were always cabs in front of the hotel, the subway was not hard at all to navigate and Penn station was just across the street.",Laura4288,2009-07-01,122005,2009-08-23,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Charming Art Deco Style Hotel” What a nice little jewel we discovered in the New Yorker Hotel! Located conveniently across from Penn Station and around the corner from the Manhattan Center, Empire State Building and other attractions within walking distance. Our room was small but not oppressively so. Our one window had a magnificient view of the Empire State Building. The decor was charming art deco with a 1920's feel. The room was very clean, the beds comfortable, the large flat screen tv was great and the added bonus was a full sized mirror outside the bathroom. We felt secure and safe in this hotel and we were 2 women vacationing alone in NYC. A plus: no one can get past security to get to the elevators for the rooms without showing your room key to the guards. 
Now for some criticisms: 
*The 24 hour diner associated with the hotel was awful. The service was awful, the food mediocre and over priced too. Unless you have no where else to go, I don't advise bothering.Walk a few feet away towards Penn Station and go to another diner on the corner and you'll have a far better experience and better food at a reasonable price. 
*The bathroom had no vanity or shelving to put any toiletries which was a pain with 2 women in the room. But they did provide a blow dryer which was a nice ammenity. The bathroom is as big as a closet too. 
*the tv is placed on the side of the room on a desk which is awkward if you want to watch it either from bed or seated. 
Other than that, it is a well priced hotel in the heart of NYC and we totally recommend it! We will definitely stay there again.

"“Great location” The New Yorker offered us a clean, quiet stay in the centre of Manhatten. Compared with other New York hotels it was reasonably priced - though staying anywhere else in the world for the same price I would expect a lot more luxury. 
The rooms are small but functional with clean bathrooms. The staff were not overly friendly but helped when asked to. The tick tock diner downstairs was excellent (especially the Oreo milkshakes which are a taste of heaven) . The main thing is the location - two blocks from the Empire State it allowed us to explore Manhatten without worrying about returning late at night.

"“Small but clean room for a great price for Manhattan""” I stayed there yesterday along with a colleague for just one night. We each had the lowest price rooms, queen rooms. These rooms are indeed very small. The door does not hit the bed when you open it, but it is quite close! However, in my experience, very small rooms are common in NY hotels. Most important, this one was quite clean and the staff were friendly. The free wi-fi was very helpful. The $160 room rate for a small, very clean room in a convenient area was well worth it. Both my colleague and I agreed we would stay there again if business brings us back to the same area soon--which it likely will. Theatre district is in walking distance--about 10 blocks..
Having read reviews here before booking our room, we chose to have breakfast at the adjacent Tick Tock Diner, which we found also to have reasonable prices for basic diner fare. The hotel I would say would be a fairly average three star in terms of amenities, but the room rates, cleanliness, and convenience make it a very good value. This accounts for my overall rating of 4.",occasionaltraveler34,2009-08-01,122005,2009-08-14,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Rooms were small compared to european hotels, but they were very clean and well designed with lots of storage space for your clothes. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

We had 1 small insect problem, but when reported it to the staff they imediately offered to send someone up to pack up our bags for us and move us to another room.

"“Value for money” I stayed in this hotel for 1 week with my friend. On arrival they upgarded the room for us. However we did not like the lighting in our room, as it was very dark near the mirror. This would have been a problem for us, as being two girls we needed a decent mirror space to get ready every day. We went straight back down, and they showed us another room which we liked and they transferred us over. The decoration of the rooms is pretty old fashioned, and could be done with a make over. However for the price we paid the rooms were reasonable. They were clean, which was an important factor to us. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. This was a highlight for us staying in this hotel. The location was GREAT!! Right next to Penn Station which was extremely convienient, and about a 10minute walk to Time Sq. There were also a lot of clothes shops near by for anyone who has come to shop in New York, with Macys being less then a 5 min walk away!! Brilliant!! All in all would recommend this hotel to anyone coming for a lesuire break, that wants to do a lot of shopping as well as sight seeing (and wont be spending too much time in the room).",FequentTraveller100,2009-07-01,122005,2009-08-03,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Totally hyped about the New Yorker!” For all you skeptics out there who have read anything negative about this property please disregard them all. I am a seasoned traveller and have stayed in the best of the best and the worst of the worst through the years. This property is CLEAN, ideally located to all the attractions of NYC. The staff were friendly especially Susie at the concierge desk! Check with them on your first day for a great map on NYC. The Tick Tock diner is handy for meals and they give you very large portions. The maid service was good and the front desk sent up a coffee maker upon request no charge for our stay. The beds were extremely comfortable. We were 3 adults in room 2401 and received a nice sized room with two double beds and 2 - 4 piece bathrooms (Yes I did say two bathrooms). That was certainly handy for three women getting ready in the mornings. So please don't hesitate to stay at The New Yorker Hotel as it is conveniently located kiddie-corner to Penn Station and just down the street from the Empire State Building and Macy's Department store.
Also, when in NYC you should try and take in some of the street vendor fare as you will not be disappointed. Try the Falafa for an evening meal or grab some fresh fruit for a light lunch or breakfast. It's all great and I can't say enough about it! Also look for a NYC bagel place. There is a good one on 50th near Rockefeller Centre between 6th and 7th Ave. called Au Bon Pain. There is nothing like New York bagels! I loved the cheddar jalapeno variety!
We discovered a tour operator called On Board tours. They charge $59 per person for a 5 1/2 hour tour for up to 14 people. It was great because with a smaller group you can hear everything and ask many questions. We got to all the highlights, including Ground Zero, Staten Island Ferry, Statue of Liberty, Central Park, Wall Street etc., etc. I'd like to give a shout out to our guide Edwin who is a survivor of 9-11.
The carriage rides at Central Park are very affordable. The are based on time and not on the number of riders. So for 3 of us for 25 minutes it was around $35 USD. Also try the little rickshaw rides, again very reasonable and highly recommend doing this at night through Times Square!

"“Big Hotel, Big Room, Great Location” We traveled to New York for the first time in July 09, and like many of the other reviewers, we had no idea where to stay, but we can recommend this hotel for those who may be unsure. On arrival, we were able to check-in earlier than expected (which was most welcome after a tiring day traveling!) As we were staying at the hotel for 10 nights, the receptionist advised us that we had been allocated a ""larger"" room with a view of the Hudson River. We were very satisfied with the room which was well presented and clean - complete with a walk in wardrobe, as well as an additional wardrobe. As noted in an earlier review, the shower was a bit savage and the hot water took a while to come through in the morning. Apart from that everything was fine - the large LCD TV was great, as was the free WIFI connection. We had breakfast in the Tick Tock Diner each morning, and found the menu to be varied and the food excellent. Totally agree about the location - you could walk to most of the main attractions, or get the subway which was close by. We took a taxi from the airport to come in (again a learning curve!), but got the train from Penn Station on our way back - a much cheaper and ""safer"" option!!

"“I Just Got Here,No Warmth...Welcome Or Water” find it urgent that I write this review as a form of venting. I have just received the worst service I have every experience at a hotel. I stood in line for 5 mintues and there were two men at the desk, one with a guest and the other just stood their and neither one greeted me. Then when one was finally ready to assist me he summons me with a waive. I was like wow this is interesting especially since his name tag read Delworth Assing, Assistant Front Office Manager. Thourghout the check-in I attempted to engage him with questions, but he was just rude. Then before handing me the keys he tells me ""oh by the way you may have a problem with your room,"" I then inquire what kind of problem? He then said we had a leak this morning, I then asked him if he could move me to another side of the building. He responded with no and said that my room is effected by the leak because they had to turn off the hot water. When I asked him how long will it be off and he said he didn't know. To me this is unacceptable, as I arrived as a red eye I will be unable to take a hot shower. I have written this review and only been here for 20 mintues. WHEW..I guess it only can get better. Oh yea there was only one person to greet me and that was a security office with no name tag, that ensure I got on the correct elevator to my room.

"“Art Deco brilliance in a brilliant location” We received a complimentary room upgrade to a room with a magnificent view of the city including the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden. The room though small, was romantic, warm and charming. The location was within easy walking distance of most major attractions in Manhattan. Check-in and check-out was smooth and staff were helpful and friendly. The Tick-Tock Diner downstairs was handy for breakfast, lunch or dinner and not too expensive. McDonalds and Burger King are close by as are all transport options. The only complaint we had was with the shower. The showerhead was not adjustable and fixed on one spray option that was very hard and felt as if you were being sandblasted. Not only that, the water temperature was lukewarm at best and we found that we were running the shower for at least 10 minutes before it was warm enough to use. The hotel has a lot of history and the lobby and reception areas are fine examples of art deco. All up, it is a great place to stay ...

"“Big hotel, small room, but great location” Travelled to NY in winter, earlier this year. As it was our first time in New York, we had no idea where or which area to stay in. Looking through all the tripadvisor reviews didn't help us make a choice as there were far too many hotels! In the end we decided to go with New Yorker as it was located close to the train station where we would get off from the train from Liberty airport, NJ. 
It couldn't be any more convenient! We got off at Penn station, and the hotel was just a few minutes' walk. 
The hotel is really big (can't remember how many floors!) but i did like the architectural style of it. It's very typical of a building you'd expect to see in NYC. Checking in took some time as there were many holiday makers. Our room was kinda small, but we weren't fussed about it as long as we had a clean room, clean sheets and a clean bathroom.
Apparently the rooms we had were the ones which have been refurbished, so they were rather modern and new. 
I can't agree more with other reviews, the location is just excellent. We could walk virtually anywhere from the hotel!

"“poorly appointed rooms not worth the hefty price” This may be a legendary hotel, but I do not think that it has kept up with the times. Its main assets are its ideal location right outside a subway station and a very good diner that is attached to the hotel. 
Unfortunately Ramada Group's ""recently renovated"" rooms do no service the claim the hotel is ready for the modern era. While the rooms were clean, there was no tea service, no kettle (you can very slowly get a pitifully small coffeemaker on request), no fridge or minibar. Essentially you were paying hefty amounts for an extremely basic room, without breakfast, in a central location. I would recommend this hotel on the basis of location-location-location for people who need to get to Broadway shows on foot (a 15 min walk) or to the Port Authority Bus Terminal (10min walk).
In addition I would suggest to hotel management to streamline their check-in and check-out system, which seems to have front desk staff tapping at their keyboards for an inordinate amount of time for each guest, resulting in an unpleasant glut of tired travellers waiting in queue during the main check-in and check-out times.

The room was renovated, very small, but clean and the bed was very good. The staff was very helpful and we could leave our bags for a small fee in the baggage room near the reception.

"“Great location with city history” If you remember all hotel rooms in NY are small then the New Yorker is of average size. Location is great; right near Macys, 2 subway station, a load of bus stops and only $10-15 dollars cab to Time Square.
The lobby is fantastically decorated and the updae rooms are tasteful.
The Diner doesn;t serve great food considering the costs but is good for a late night snack if you're tired and staying close to home.
The price is reasonable for the quality of hotel and location - you owuld have to downgrade to get much closer in.

Further, hotel staff moved us to a slightly larger room to accomodate a roller bed for a friend staying over night.

Parking: We parked in a garage on 35th street, between 8th and 9th Ave, and received a discount rate because we were staying at the New Yorker.
Rooms: Compared to other hotels outside of NYC, the rooms are tiny, but for the amount of time one stays in the room, the room size is n/a. The rooms and the rest of the hotel has been renovated, so the rooms house new beds and furniture. The bathrooms were always fine. Get a room with a window; ours looked uptown and had a nice breeze.

"“Great start to a great holiday” We stayed in the New Yorker from the 29th june - 3rd July 2009.
It was roughly 30 minutes from JFK airport and situated in the heart of all the main attractions (pratically walking distance to everything - depending if you prefer to walk than get taxi's everywhere)
When we got out of the taxi a bell boy carried our cases to the reception desk, where we were greeted by extremely helpful and polite staff.
We even got an upgarde to a city view room, as it was my husbands birthday. We were on the 24th floor and had an amazing view from both windows (madison square garden from one and the empire state building from the other)
The rooms were not particualry huge but lets be fair, who goes to NY to spend all day in the room. It had all the amenities you need in a hotel room: comfortable bed, bathroom, hair dryer in the bathroom, tv, ironing board + iron. It also had free wifi, which came in very handy as we could send and receive emails keeping those huge roaming mobile phone bills down.
Each night we came back to our room after spending very long days in NYC, the cleaning staff had come in and re-made the bed and provided clean fresh towels. We ate in the ticktock diner for breakfast, all i can say is YUMMY and very good value for money.
Checking out was a breeze too, and the bell boy whistled us a taxi to take us back to the airport.

“Loved the New Yorker Hotel” We have just returned from a week in NY staying at The New Yorker hotel. Our room was superb and very large for the 3 of us. It was cleaned daily and we found it a very nice room to return to after a busy and tiring day. The beds were very comfortable too. The staff were always nice to us anytime we spoke to them. The loaction is great. Its very central for all the shops and attractions as well as public transport ie. subways and buses.

"“Fantastic location, great onsite facilities, very comfortable” I booked this hotel online despite some negative reviews and was very pleased that I did. The entire booking process was very quick and efficient. I arrived late at night and was greeted very well and was made to fee comfortable by the staff. My room was shockingly tiny and had no view except of other sections of the hotel. This being said the bed was extremely comfortable and the room had all necessary amenities. The bathroom showed its age despite efforts to upgrade it and the in room amenities were very limited.
The location of this property is FANTASTIC you have everything you could possibly need within walking distance of the hotel - Macy's, Cinema's, Restaurants, Shops etc. The onsite Diner was excellent value and offered a wide menu choice.
I would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants to see New York.",sajiGuyana,2009-06-01,122005,2009-07-03,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Does what it says on the tin...” Stayed in room 2516 and arrived by SuperShuttle @ 3pm (check-out 12pm, check-in 3pm). Swift check-in by Mohammed on the front desk if a little too brisque. A package had been sent by a friend but he wasn't as helpful as he could have been in guiding me as to where I should go/who I should talk to about getting the package just kept pointing and saying 'stand there' which as a solo traveller first time in the USA? Somewhat aggravating. Perhaps it was due to the busy period of check-in however. 
Considering I was a solo traveller the room was plenty large enough, air conditioning was turned on for my return each day by housekeeping, ice bucket (and ice machine on landing between lifts and my room) available, towels (enviro-policy adopted of they'll change them if you leave on floor, if you hang up they won't), linen changed every third day unless otherwise indicated, flat screen television fitted to wall (movies/recent television episodes available for purchase), iron & ironing board in the closet (along with hangers for shirts/trousers and a luggage stand), plenty of drawer space, alarm clock, usual toiletries in bathroom and soft/main lighting.
I think the rooms only start on the 20th floor going up from there. I never personally had a problem with sound - my room was on the 34th street side (as opposed to 8th avenue side which has McDonalds on it across the road from the hotel open 24/7).
Staff were always very pleasant from housekeeping to reception/concierge. Everyone said hello to you even if you were yo-yo-ing backwards and forwards in and out of the hotel. 
Checked out at 12pm and was able to use the restroom downstairs (grab a card from concierge as you need this to access it) and stayed in the Foyer waiting for SuperShuttle back to JFK.
Also tried the Tick Tock Diner on last day - nothing spectacular but fast service, quick hot food and attentive staff.",drawdoow,2009-06-01,122005,2009-07-01,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“cockroaches, poor staff service, tiny rooms = not returning” I was impressed by the lobby, but thats about all I was impressed with. Our room was quite small, hardly any room for luggage and my sister who stayed the whole week had an even smaller room! It just about fit the bed and a desk and thats it! literally no room what-so-ever to walk in or to hold luggage! the bathroom doors wouldnt lock properly in either rooms. And TWO cockroaches were found in our room, which is definitly not a good sign for cleanliness! The diner was alright, the food was average, the coffee tasted of water and the staff were quite intimidating and abrupt! The check out time was at about 11am, which was fine, but someone opened our door at about 6am in the morning, good thing i put the dead bolt on!
Staff behind the front desk were standing in small groups talking to eachother while i, along with other guests waited!

"“Good base to explore NYC” Stayed at the New Yorker Hotel for 5 nights at the beginning of June. I was travelling with my mum for a joint birthday celebration and we specifically wanted a twin room in a midtown hotel. I booked us a refurbished double double room with flights via Expedia and got a good deal. I did a lot of internet searching and looking at reviews before making our booking. I have previously visited New York and stayed at the Roger Williams Hotel and knew this would not be quite to that standard but didn't want to be disappointed when we arrived! 
We were not disappointed by the New Yorker. The rooms are fairly small as other reviewers have commented but this is a factor of New York Hotels. Our double double room was exactly as pictured on the website and was clean and modernly decorated and was nice to relax in after being out and about. The bathroom could have done with updating but was adequate and a decent size. The beds were comfortable and our room had a view of the Hudson River which was nice. The rooms do not have their own safes so we used the safety deposit boxes for our valuables which worked out ok. We had breakfast at the Tick Tock diner a couple of times and it was nice to have this in the hotel as we could eat there and then get off on our sight seeing etc. 
I thought the hotel was a good base for getting around. We got a 3 day Grayline bus ticket - hop on and off to see the sights with tour guides (cost $98 but includes Ellis Island & Statue of Liberty and either Empire State Building or Top of the Rock - we did Empire State Building at night which was fab, it also inc $50 off Chicago tickets that we used) and it was about a ten min walk to the nearest pick up point. Macys and the shops on 34th Street are really nearby as is Madison Square Garden. We went to see a couple of shows on Broadway and walked back from Time Square to the hotel which was about 15-20mins. For a nice lunch I would recommend Tavern on the Green in Central Park, it was $39 for the set three course lunch but the food and atmosphere was definitely worth the money. I would definitely stay at the New Yorker again when visiting New York.",Exclusive,2009-06-01,122005,2009-06-23,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Great location” Returned to NYC and decided to stay in the New Yorker again after reading it had been refurbished. Rooms are VERY small but space is at a premium here! They haven't totally refurbished the rooms, just updated them. The Tick Tock diner underneath the hotel is 24 hours and great!
Ideally located next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, a few blocks from Times Square, Empire State and Macy's.
Highlights this time were:
1) Walked across the Brooklyn bridge (great people watching!)
2) Eat at Lombardi's pizza in Little Italy... arrive hungry!
3) Wandered round Greenwich Village and eat at Magnolia bakery
4) Walked round most of Central Park in the sun

"“Great location & room with a view!” I stayed at the new yorker hotel last year and I would highly recommend it. When checking in we were given a room upgrade, to a newly refurbished room. It was one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in, very clean and modern! At the end of the room was a large window that looked straight out over the empire state building. . .wev got some great pictures at sunset! In a city like new york most people won't be spending much time in their hotel room but after the chaos of the city it was a great place to come back and relax. Having been to New York before i realise that most rooms tend to be fairly small but it was a good size and for such a central location we couldn't here that many taxi beeps from the roads down below.

"“Couldn't be better!” Just got back from my first New York trip with a friend. We stayed at the New Yorker Hotel and had a nice room in the 26 th floor. The room was small but newly refurbished, very clean and comfortably decorated - and fulfilled its purpose for providing a good sleep after spending days with 12 hours walking all over Manhattan. The staff was friendly, an extra bonus is definitely the security check at the elevators (you are required to show a key card before entering to the elevators area). Best location within walking distance from many attractions, metro stations in front of the hotel doors, extra bonus is the nearness to the Penn Station which is a crossing point for almost all metro lines. A block away to the south along the 8th avenue is a nice restaurant Stage Doors for great and comfy breakfast to a reasonable price (hotel restaurant Tick Tock is much more expensive for breakfast!). 
The New York Pass is highly recommendable as it includes free entrance without queuing to the most attractions and entitles to a 11 % reduction at Macy's and Bloomingdales! 
Another thing I would like to recommend is the AirLink airport service. They bring from the airport and pick you up to the airport directly in front of the hotel door. In addition to this, they also kind of provide an extra sightseeing while the transportation to the JFK through Queensboro Bridge across Queens (works at daylight better, of course). Don't make it hard by taking the metro from the JFK to Manhattan with luggage; the AirLink service is worth every dollar.",Susanna69,2009-06-01,122005,2009-06-08,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

We asked for a city view room, and were told that this should cost $40 dollars per night more, but were eventually given a room on the 23rd floor, looking our towards the Empire State Building, a few blocks up.

“Excellent hotel close to all the action” Back in 2007 when we went to the New Yorker the renovation was still occuring. We managed to score a room that had its renovation completed already and it was a real treat. The room itself was clean and was high up enough to have a nice view of the city (no real landmarks from our window besides the NY Times building). The bathroom and main room were a little small but when in NY I'd only expect to be in the room to wash up and sleep so it didn't really matter. The TV was an excellent size. The service overall was okay. The first person we talked to was a little rude but thankfully after that it was fine. The hotel is close to everything you would want as a visitor to the city.

"“Absolutely brilliant hotel, amazing location.” Well, I stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights on the 19th May 2009, we got an upgraded room as I work for a travel agency, and was on the 37th floor. The view was amazing, we have 3 big windows, the two at the front you could clearly see the Empire State building, Madison Square Gardens and the window on our right, was facing towards the Statue of Liberty and you could also see the Hudson river.
The service from everyone was brilliant, right from the bell boys to the check in desk and customer services. 
The Tick Tock Diner was excellent and very clean, which is connected to the hotel and open to the public, the food was amazing and at a reasonable price too. 
The location of the hotel was excellent, ten minutes walk up 34th street you passed lots and lots of different shops and you reached Times Square. One block away was Macy's and Penn Station was just across the road. Empire State was 3 blocks away.
We got the hop on - hop off bus and I would recommend it as it's a great way to see all the sights in New York. 
I will definatly be returning to this hotel and would recommend it to everyone. It is great for singles, couples, families, groups.
I loved it!",louise-jade,2009-05-01,122005,2009-05-27,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Perfect location” This is the perfect location to stay in New York for a sightseeing trip with Times Square, Macey and the Empire State Building in one direction and Madison Square Garden the other. Close to Penn Station and the subway for a short ride the other parts of town for Central Park, Wall Stree and ferry for Statue of Liberty.
The rooms have recently been re-furbished. We had a standard twin room, lovely big beds with quality mattresses and lovely soft pillows, very good nights sleep .The room was not very big it was adeqate for the 4 day stay. It was clean and well decorated. Really impressed that within 10 minutes of arriving in our room reception rang to ask if everything was okay. We were then offerred complimentary tea and coffee in the room. this really made a difference and we just had to ask for re-fills each day. There is a diner attached to the hotel on one side and a restauraunt on the other which is handy if you are too tired to look around for somewhere to eat. My friend and I felt very safe in this hotel, the staff were friendly and security was discreet but stringent at all times. I would thoroughly recommend this Hotel and will definately choose it again if I have the opporuntity to return to New York.",Lanidoo,2009-05-01,122005,2009-05-23,False,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“If you want to be close to the sights ? This is good place to stay!” I stayed here for 7 nights late April early May 2009 with partner and 4 friends. It was a big trip to tick off one of the places to visit before you die (good book) ! We were not let down. It's everything past visitors remarks say. Yes it's big and loud and busy and it's in your face but that's New York If you don't like that stuff I would suggest don't go.
The hotel was built in the 1930's I think the upgrade is as good as you might get with the structure of the building with all the factilities you need. However it still has a past time feel which I enjoyed with a grand open lobby. I feel nearly all the new plush very similar modern hotels are featureless. (personal view) Rooms are small but ok for sleeping and planning you next venture across the city. Do the sites I would recomend the downtown night tour it ticks a big one off that 1000 things ! Take a travel ketle if you need a cuppa to get you going in the morning.

"“Amazing new yorker, Amazing new york!” We arrived at The New Yorker Hotel and checked in straight away, we'd upgraded our room prior to arrival, the room on hold was not going to be ready till 3pm and as it was only 1pm they offered us an alternate room which was ready now and was of the same standard.
The room was very neat and tidy and was cleaned to a high standard daily, As we had upgraded our room from a Run Of The House to a City View room we had alot of room space (other reviews say how small the rooms are, however it came at a price of $240 for the week) Only problem we had was that their was no currancy exchange in the hotel, but wasn't too much of a problem as Macys was only a short stroll away (be warned exchange doesn't open on sundays) The hotel's location was great, across the road was Madison Sq Garden, 5 minutes walk to The Emire State Building, Times Square and a nice walk away from Central Park, FAO Schwartz, Bloomingdales and Saxs! As for New York it's self....it was amazing, the people are really friendly and helpfull and will do anything to help you! The food was always nice but be warned they add tax, plus tip! (roughly £70 for 2 main meals + drink each!) Same with shopping, the price you see on the label is not the price you pay after they add the tax at the till!

"“Expected a bit more” This hotel is certainly not bad, but I would be careful what you pay for it as I think there are better options. I booked this on Hotwire as a 3.5-star hotel. While it may well be in terms of amenities, I feel that the facilities were a bit outdated. The bathroom, for instance, had tiles coming up, had an old claw-type tub with knobs that you turn, and the shower was difficult to operate and made a mess everywhere. If I recall correctly, there was a small radiator in the bathroom. Are any of these things bad? No; I would just like to think it's worth staying somewhere a bit more modern.
The rooms are, of course, small. No big deal; the bed and bedding was nice. The window had an a/c unit in it, but the view was OK. Elevator speed is moderate, and the lobby is nothing to write home about.
Service at this hotel is lacking. I will say their security was at least in good order, as they are very strict about not letting up non-guests at all hours, especially night. I wouldn't say the location is fantastic, although there certainly is a good deal to do around the area, there's a drug store across the street, and if you're taking Amtrak/LIRR/NJ Path/subway to/from the hotel, you can easily walk from Penn Station. I'd prefer to stay closer to the park, since in my opinion there's not much to do west of 8th Ave.
Overall, I'd make sure you get a good deal. I paid close to $200/night and feel like I could have done better, seeing that I booked through Hotwire, yet the Marriott Marquis had a deal running for barely $300/nt, which to me would have been worth it.",Andrew H,2008-06-01,122005,2009-05-17,False,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great hotel” Hotel is in a great location. Staff are really friendly, the housekeeping staff are great.
Until we arrived to check in no body had advised of a $300 security deposit, luckily we had a credit card.
Tick Tock diner is not great, prices are high and the service is very very slow.
Try the Stage Door diner one block up, much better.

"“Nice hotel, good location” Only stayed for one night. The welcome was good and the staff very helpful. The room was clean and very well presented. The location is great right next to Penn station so great for the LIRR straight from JFK and or accessing the subway system. The hotel has lots of history from when it was the largest hotel in New York in the 1920's, 1930's and famous for the people that stayed there. It was closed in the 60's but refurbished in the 1990's.Don't bother with the adjoining dinner to the hotel, food was not great and expensive for what it was. there are plenty of other places near by with better food.",mt14,2009-05-01,122005,2009-05-15,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC” This is our second trip to the new yorker and had the most fantastic stay. We had a lovely clean and spacious room on the 26th Floor.

"“Great location to explore New York” We stayed 3 nights at the New Yorker and thoroughly enjoyed it. Checked in fairly easily after a long journey and headed up to the 30-something floor to our room; the lifts on the right bypass the first 20 or so floors, so it isn't a long trip. I think the lower floors are dorm-type, as there were a lot of school trips/ students etc around in the lobby, but it is plenty big enough for many kinds of traveller. The only one I objected to (late at night) was the idiot in a Guinness hat jumping up and down in the lift on one of the journies up, but we did go over Spring Break/ St Patrick's Day weekend!
Room was on the small side, but we expected this and were happy with what we had. The whole hotel is in Art Deco style and this works well. Not much of a view (city was requested) due to the angle of other buildings, just a sheer drop down to the street, which was fun though. Due to the location on 8th Ave/ W 34th St (I think), there is some street noise even this high up, but nothing apart from the fire engines actually woke us.
Bathroom is fine, nothing special but functional enough. The walk-in wardrobe was a plus for cases etc, although you need to keep everything in there or hidden away - we left a carrier bag with souvenir photos of the Empire State just near the chest of drawers one day and the cleaner took it, presuming it was rubbish so that was a shame (and it didn't get handed in). Staff were friendly and helpful though, always saying good morning and smiling.
Location is great; we got the NJ train from Newark right into Penn Station opposite so this saved us taxi fares (we also caught back to the airport for our flight on to Toronto), so a $15 per person fare - good value. We walked most days up to the sights; Empire State very close and other mid-town attractions are very convenient. Subway stops for a wide range of lines either right outside or at Penn Station.
Also worth mentioning that Madison Square Garden is right across the road, and there were hockey fans in the hotel and diner, so it's very handy. There is also a small shop and fitness suite in the basement (down the escalators) - we didn't use the gym but saw plenty of people doing so, and the shop was brilliant for last minute bits and bobs (and very friendly lady). And there was wi-fi in the room, so my husband was pleased - although it seemed to stop working 5 minutes after our check-out in the lobby (either there are 2 systems or they are very efficient!)
We didn't eat at the hotel, but the bar seemed popular (especially due to St Patrick's Day). Did eat at Tick Tock Diner for breakfast on our first morning, which was great. Also got a muffin/ pastry from the stand in the lobby when we were checking out.
An ideal base for New York, and good value I think (especially as we booked together with flight on Expedia and only paid about £50 extra). Definitely recommended.",hscomps,2009-03-01,122005,2009-05-06,False,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“good hotel, excellent location!!” My husband and I stayed at the New Yorker at the beginning of May for 4 nights. 
We booked the metro rooms, we read they were small and it was but served its purpose as we were only there to sleep at night. the room was very clean and comfortable. It has a flat screen TV, desk, small closet and small bathroom.
The service was good with fast and efficient check in and check out system. The staff at the information desk was very friendly and helpful. Although i didnt find conceierge so helpful as I was making an enquiry by phone and got transferred to them, the lady was very rude and put phone down on me, no bye no nothing. 
As we were booked on a later flight back to UK, we left our luggage at the hotel. Be mindful that they charge you $1 to leave it there and $1 to collect it again, we only had 2 suitcases and 'm not sure if they charge more if oyu have more bags. I was not advised of this charge nor was there a sign but hey, that's the man's tip gone. 
The hotel is very convenient, across the road from Madison Square Gardens (we had a room facing it), 2 blocks from Empire State Building, 1 block from Macy's and there is a metro station downstairs - Penn Station on 34th Street. There are 2 Penn stations so becarful when looking at the tube map. I'm normally very good with directions and map reading but this underground system really threw me as the station platforms aren't very well signed posted. Just remember whether you want to travel uptown (towards Central Park / Harlem) or downtown (Financial district / Brooklyn) You can easily get to main tourist atttractions one these lines including Statue of Liberty, Central Park, America's Natural History Museum, Brookyln Bridge etc
We walked to most places as the hotel location was excellent. Times Sq is only 10 minutes walk away as it 5th avenue if you want to do some serious shopping. 
The only downfall is the hotel does not offer breakfast as a package. However there is a 24hr tick tock diner at the hotel which most people went to. The service is friendly, good food but I found it rather expensive. There are some other cafes nearby. 
Overall it was an excellent choice and I would deifnately recommend this hotel.",mini1978,2009-05-01,122005,2009-05-05,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“great location” well we had a great stay at the new yorker. There were 6 of us and we wanted a central location and the New Yorker was just right for us. We used the subway quite a bit and it definately puts London tubes in the shade, $2 to go anywhere! so much cheaper and easier to use.
The hotel was near everything which was just what we wanted. Near quite a few diners for breakfast, which if you are british the portions are massive, but great! Uncle Jacks steak restaraunt just round corner was fantastic food, not cheap but great steaks.
The staff were rude on occasions, but alot of New Yorkers seemed that way! Not all though don't get me wrong. If you want a hotel that is in a good location and clean then this is ideal.

"“What a Fantastic Hotel, nothing could have made our stay better!” ...Out of Penn Station you come, and straight in front of you is the towering New Yorker Hotel. 
We were greeted by a friendly face at the reception, checked in (early might I add, with no prior notice given), and directed up to our room. We had possibly one of the best placed rooms in the entire hotel, on the 36th floor, facing directly onto the Empire State Building and looking down onto Madison Square Gardens. The view of the New York City skyline was simply breathe taking. The rooms were small, but coming from London where we're very much used to this, it really didn't feel unfamiliar. The bathroom was clean and bright, and had a fantastic, deep Victorian (well it was old) bath to relax in, as well as a well functioning over-head shower. The room was cleaned and tidied every day, with fresh, clean towels giving on each day - something not quite expected from a 3 star hotel.
We never actually ate at the Tick Tock Diner (we chose to sample the food further out in the city streets), however it was always very full, and looked like it had a pretty cool atmosphere. We did try the stagedoor for breakfast just down the road which was great, and was apparently a little cheaper than the Tick Tock.
NYC is a phenomenal city, and if you're looking for a good, clean, friendly base to stay while you get exploring, The New Yorker Hotel is certainly it. I would have no problem recommending this hotel to any of my family or friends, and would certainly consider returning on our next visit to NYC.

"“Fantastic hotel, thats value for money!” My friend and I stayed at the New Yorker from the 17th April for five fantastic days for double birthday celebrations and we were not disappointed! I understand that the hotel has undergone a recent refurbishment and therefore the rooms are clean and beautiful. Check in was hassle free and we found all the staff to be extremely helpful, even letting us use the internet free of charge to do a online check for our return flight. We had breakfast every morning from the tick tock restaurant, but being two lazy tired girls we ordered it to our room every morning and this came promptly and avoided the hassle of waiting in a busy restaurant. The location is amazing! 5 minutes from Maceys and Herald Square which is home to a whole host of other shops and about 10 walk from Times Square which as 2 girls we felt quite safe walking back from at late hours in the night. My friend and I between us have worked in the travel industry for 20 years and think considering this hotel is only rated in english brochures a 3 star rating it is excellent value for money. The few minor negative comments that I read on tripadvisor I didnt seem to witness on my stay, however being english i do realise that we are less critical than the americans and let more things go over our heads.

It is on the metro line from JFK right outside the 34th Street station so there is no wandering about with heavy luggage.

"“LOOKING FORWARD TO MY NEXT VISIT” Would recommend that travellers use New Yorker Rides. Book your transport to/from the airport to the hotel. Better than using a yellow cab.

Great location. Close to Macy's, Broadway, Times Square and the Empire State building, etc. (Don't miss the trip to the 86th Floor!!) There are numerous places to eat but we enjoyed the Tick Tock Diner. Open 24 hours a day. The staff were also friendly and enjoyed the Scottish banter.

"“Location” My husband booked a 4day trip to New York in February. We stayed at the New Yorker hotel. The lobby is grand with massive chandaliers, with a very strong Art Deco influence. I was pleasantly surprised by the art deco feel of the bathroom and bedroom. Particularly the bathroom, as it had a very rustic vintage feel to it!
The concierge staff were very helpful, particularly with directions and recommendations of restaurants and places to visit =) The check-in and check-out staff were not as pleasant though!
Im not sure how much it cost for our visit as it was part of a package deal with the flights - plus we had a good exchange rate in 2006! I'd recommend this hotel and would probably stay here again.
The best thing about staying at The New Yorker was its location. Everything that we needed was within comfortable walking distance.
Empire State Building was 2 blocks away (if you go to the top of empire state building, you can clearly see the hotel because of its massive sign!).
Maceys the shopping department store was 4 blocks away.
Madison Square Garden was practically across the road.
Korea town for authentic korean bbq was about 10minutes walk away.
Subway was round the corner - so travel was not an issue. Access to lots of high street retailers and fast food chains (Wendys, TGI, Starbucks etc). Internet cafes are also acceessible as (at the time) wireless internet access in our hotel room was not available.
Advice:
Please be warned if you visit New York in February - it was quite cold! Make sure you take your winter woolies - coat, gloves, scarf!

"“Excellent location and value” Stayed at this hotel over the Easter weekend for 3 nights. Despite the hotel being very large we were able to check-in early (about 1 hour early) without waiting. The hotel is very clean and modern looking, despite being one of the oldest hotels in NYC. The hotel is entirely smoke free so there was no issue with odour. The room was small but what do you expect for NYC. There was enough space to keep luggage and walk around the bed. You shouldn't be spending much time in the room except for sleep. The bed was very comfortable and clean as was the rest of the room and bathroom. Unfortunately we had some noisy people down the hall for 1 night but nothing that you can hold against the hotel. Ear plugs are a good travel tip when staying at any hotel. The room had a flat panel TV with stations like the discovery channel and food network and a pretty big closet. There was an iron and board as well. The bathroom was a good size. The shower does change temperatures frequently, but it is a large hotel and is old. It is also not as bad as people say here. It does not go ice cold or so hot you can't stand under it. It is tolerable. I don't think this should make or break you stay anyways. The only gripe about the room was that there was a draft from the windows seeing how they are hung windows. There was also a slight whistle noise from the window because some caulking was missing.
The location is worth every penny. You are steps to the blue line (ACE), as well as walking distance to the red (1,2,3) line (walk east on 34th to 7th ave) and if need be walk to Times Square (15 mins) to catch any train you want. I highly recommend talking the subway to get places after walking the street once. It is really easy to use and a 1 day pass is 7.50 USD (you have to buy this from the machine). Find a good map of the city and a subway map and you are set.
We used New York Airport Service to get to this hotel (21 dollars + tips round trip per person from LGA), but be aware that they do expect tips. On the return they will pick you up from your hotel and take you directly to the airport. The service was actually early and we had no issues getting to the airport.

"“Excellent choice, central to everything” We stayed at the New Yorker in late March for 5 nights, the booking through Airmiles. We arrived around 5.30pm and were told that our room was not ready and waiting inspection by senior cleaning staff. We asked if we could have another room as we had been travelling all day and should have been able to check in from 3pm, another room was available and so we were given the keys to this one. Rooms are very small but what I would expect in a large city.
The hotel is in an excellent location for everything. Would recommend The Bread Factory cafe nearby for breakfast. Pasties and hot drinks are available at reasonable price, you can also get salad's, pizza, cheesecake, baguette's, crisps, cold drinks and more there. 
The only annoying thing's about the New Yorker were that you could hear everything from the people in the room next door through the air vent in our bathroom, their alarm clock, conversations, the TV etc and that the water temperature was either boiling hot or freezing cold in the shower no matter what time of day you used it, this we found partically frustrating.

"“Great location and value” Just stayed at the New Yorker for 2 nights with my teenage son. We were in town for his Spring break to see some sights and a show.
 The location across from Penn Station and Madison Sq Garden is excellent- convenient to the blue and red subway lines. Just a few blocks from Times Square, Theater district, Midtown, etc. 
Our room at $169- was typical NY small with a double bed. Nicely furnished. Flat screen TV. Free wireless that worked well. I saw no need to upgrade to the ""faster"" wireless at $9.95 a day.
We arrived early on Monday and they were able to put us in a room at 12:30 instead of waiting until 3:00. I found no issues with unfriendly service, though we did not have a lot of interaction.
All in all, a very good value and location for NY.",IndigoSurfer,2009-04-01,122005,2009-04-10,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Superb, fantastic, highly recommended” In a nutshell this is an amazing hotel, and as most other reviews have said its location is perfect. Our flight was cancelled when we were leaving from the UK so we arrived a day later, the hotel didnt charge us for the night that we missed and gave us the extra night at the end of our stay. No hassel whatsover. The rooms were great, yeah bathrooms are a bit small but do you go to New York to sit in the bathroom? Its an iconic hotel and you get a real feel for New York gone by when you stay here, probably has a lot to do with the Art Deco design. The rooms were beautifully designed, we paid an extra $113 to upgrade to a New Yorker room which was well worth it. We had a fantastic view and also two double beds in our room (we only needed one so we had plenty room).

"“Excellent” My mum & I arrived at hotel just after 1pm, were checked into our room on 22nd Floor by 1.20pm by a lovely receptionist. We had no problem getting an early check-in as thankfully it was not that busy & our room was ready. I had phoned a few days earlier to ask if this could be arranged.
We couldnt fault the room at all - plenty of space & even gave my mother extra duvets as she was feeling cold at night.
We ate in the Tick Tock diner the next morning & it didn't knock the socks off me -- preferred to have breakfast either at the Port Authority or Macys which was better value & better selection.
When we left on the Friday the hotel was getting much busier as they had a conference on & left our luggage in the storage room - yes you have to pay but its only 50c per case so well worth plus you do not have to vacate your room till 12.
Cleaning staff do knock around 9am to see if ok to clean your room but I suppose they have to start somewhere so wasnt too much of a nuisance.
The Hotel is brilliantly located to all the shops especially Macys,American Eagle & Forever 21 & the Port Authority if you wish to go shopping in Jersey Gardens.
We enjoyed our stay in the New Yorker & would highly recommend the hotel to all age groups & found all staff exceptional.",FlynnerDublin,2009-03-01,122005,2009-04-03,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Fresh Face - Cold Bones” I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel in March '09. The hotel had obviously just been remodeled. The lobby, the bar and especially my room were very nice, clean and attractive. Unfortunately the bathroom left a lot to be desired. It's an old hotel so the crusted bathroom window and layers of paint I could live with. The fixtures were new so that was a plus too. The BIG negative was the water. In the shower the water switched from scalding to freezing multiple times. I would have thought there was a law against that kind of old school plumbing. I don't remember an experience like that since I was a kid yelling from the shower ""Who's using the water! I'm in the shower"". Needless to say I will avoid the New Yorker until I hear the plumbing has been upgraded.

"“amazing location - great trip” My husband and I had never been to New York City. We flew into JFK, took the train located right at the airport through Jamaica Station, all of the way to Penn Station. So cheap and took less than 40 minutes. At Penn station we climbed the escalator, arrived on the street and one block up was the hotel. Right in the middle of everything! Empire state short walk! The best part was being literally right across from Penn station because for less than 2.00 round trip we went everywhere FAST! We stayed three days, and not once did we take a taxi! Transfers back to the airport were just as easy. The hotel diner (tick-tock) was cheap, fast and good. The room was clean, the bed very comfy. Our views were spectacular. Only complaint was my husband got warm showers at different times everyday, but every time I got in (at different times each day) the water was scalding hot and only dripped out of the faucet (literally, I had to use the sink to finish once) and the other times when pressure was good, it was cool. I think the best time was actually in the morning rather than at night. (Also, I can't leave out that the rooms are small compared to other trips in other cities, but we knew that most rooms in NY are like this so we were prepared. We had everything we needed in the room, and it was still cozy. It really was not even an inconvienece) Even with the water problem, I would stay there again in a heart beat for the location and the price. P.S The city is a must to see and experience!",heart_travel,2008-10-01,122005,2009-03-27,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Everything we were promised and more.” Travelled with my wife and teenage daughter from the UK to NYC on March 20th. Read the reviews on T/A and got a bit of a mixed bag of opinions which is good. Was attracted by the location and the fact that there was a 24 hr diner witthin the hotel. Booked with letsgo2.com who were very efficient. Flew with Continental from Manchester, who were every bit as good.
We took the train from Newark airport to Penn Station, which is a 5 min walk to the hotel. On our arrival we were met at the front desk by the very helpful Muhammed. We asked to extend room use until 18:00 on check out day to co-incide with our flight home. Not only did we get a free upgrade to a suite, but he sorted this for us for $75+tax. The hotel was probably built in the 1950's and has recently had a full refit. Our room was nothing short of perfect. On the 23rd floor, overlooking 8th Ave, The Empire State building and Madison Square Garden, complete with TWO large flat screen tv's.
With about 7 elevators, getting to our room from the lobby never took more than 5 mins. Times Square was a ten min walk up 8th Ave. Rooms were serviced daily, and cleaning staff were great. We did all the usual visits, but the best was the helicopter trip around Manhatten and up the river. It's not cheap but at $160 inc tax and fuel supp it was worth every penny. Suprizingy, we used the 24 hr MacDonalds outside the hotel for breakfast every day. Without question it represented great value for money, with a very varied menu too. The hotel diner we found to be a little pricey altho the food was good. Do take your laptop as the hotel provides free WiFi which was very useful. Shopping for clothes, shoes, electronics is great if you look around. The stores near the hotel are very competative. The nearer you get to Times Square however, the dearer it gets. Avoid those trendy eateries in Greenwich and Soho, we paid $100 for diner for 3 of us, which wasn't much tastier than MacDonalds!!
For the return journey to the airport, we opted to use the hotel's transportation service. They confirm your flight, and provided us with a limo for $85. This is considerably more money than the train ($15 each) but is much quicker. All in all we will use the hotel again, and look forward to going back soon. You wont be disappoined, there are some less than pretty hotels in the city. We are glad we chose this one (thanx to TripAdvisor xx",RickyLeeds,2009-03-01,122005,2009-03-24,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“1929-2009, Well Done” This hotel has lots of history and has a definite art deco feel to it. The New Yorker is in the perfect location. Madison Square Garden is across the street and down the street is Penn Station. We walked everywhere, we went to Times square, Rockefeller Center, St Patrick's Cathedral, the Barking Dog Cafe and we had a ball. Restaurant Row is only several blocks away the New Yorker where we found a terrific little Italian Trattoria. The lobby has lots of seating and the staff was super friendly, respectful and helpful. I wanted extra pillows and I got them very quickly.
 Some reviewers complained that the rooms are small, maybe, but what our room lacked in size it made up for with chic retro vibes, cleanliness and quiet, no kidding, it's very quiet. There's free HBO for later. Who's staying in anyway? There's more than enough room to be comfortable. There's a gym downstairs and after check out, you can leave your bags with security for the rest of the day, for a buck!.. Very nice, very convenient. And, the New Yorker is pet friendly...I was very pleased and would recommend the New Yorker to anyone.",elombard,2009-03-01,122005,2009-03-24,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Hotel - Excellent Location” We spent 3 nights at the New Yorker and have just returned. I was really pleased with our choice. 
The location was excellent. Close to both 5th Avenue and Times Square.
The rooms were small, but adequate. My only complaint was that there were no drawer space for items of clothers that you cannot hang in the wardrobe. We ended up keeping them in our case. The bed was lovely and comfy and trust me after the long days we were grateful. We found all the staff to be very friendly and professional.
We ate at the Tic Tock Diner the 1st morning and I had Eggs Benedict which was about $8.95. We also ate at the Stage Door Deli just down the street and we did find that to be better value. $8.95 also got you coffee, juice and toast. 
Lunch we just usually grabbed a hot dog from one of the many stands around the city.
We had dinner at the Hard Rock cafe, which was excellent and on our last night we splashed out and went to The Tavern on the Green. It was really beautiful. I paid the equivelent to £30 for my entree, which was prime rib. It was the size of a joint of beef enough to feed a family of 4. I only managed 4 mouthfuls so it was a lot of expense for what I ate. It was still a lovely end to our trip.
We flew into Newark and took the train. It was $15 each way. It was really easy and took about 20mins.. The only thing is don't bother if you have a lot of luggage. Penn station is all stairs. I still struggled with my small case on wheels. As a result the handle broke. Our hotel was right opposite the station.
We did the Grayline 48hour all loop sightseeing bus. it was excellent. You can hop on and off. Some of the guides were really great and very entertaining. Others were not so great. We took the Staten Island ferry which is free. This gives you great views of Manhatten. We also got a free water taxi included in our tour ticket. This got you closer to the Statue of Liberty and the guide and staff were great. We did the Statue of Liberty on the Sunday morning. We pre-paid for our tickets and got go straight up. I had heard horror stories of having to qeue for hours. Guess we were lucky. 
We loved our trip to New York. We were really lucky with the weather too. Earlier in the week they had snow storms and on arrival we saw the remnants of this. By the Saturday we were walking around Central Park minus our jackets.

"“Worth returning: Comfortable and great location” We had booked our reservations online. We had gotten a pretty good rate, but when we arrived there, we were told the rate we had was a computer error and instead of $139, they had to charge us $199.
We weren't happy paying more for the same room, so management offered us a better room: newly renovated, on the top floor with a fabulous view. We were surprised to see we had a living room separate from the bedroom. The furnishings were really nice and all in Art Deco style. 
The bed was really comfortable and to me, having a white duvet on the bed just reassures me that it IS clean. There were too many pillows on the bed to sleep in, but really useful for reading in bed.

"“Appropriate with inadequate management response” I have stayed at this Hotel in February 2009 for six days. The room although not big was satisfactory.
 The benefits of the Hotel are: good location , free broadband internet , business center and generally the rooms are clean. The staff,generally was courteous and nice.
 The problems with the hotel: the quality of the Staff is not uniform, some lack basic good manners . Lack of room service is a ""down"" and lack of restaurant (the only one adjacent is not part of the hotel) whose food goes from the atrocious to the banal (unless you like only fast food).
Thre was also an incident that marked my stay at the hotel. Once I was coming back to my room and I was stooped by a security guard of the Hotel, a lady which asked for my room key. Out of dozens of customers at the time, I was the only one asked for the key.
 I lodged a complaint at the frontdesk and the reply was nully. Nobody bothered to even consider the possibility of wrongdoing or apologies. A management system which is clearly inappropriate. Do they even know what ISO 9000 norms say about quality?
The hotel may be adequate good for a quick stay, nevertheless for the price I paid , I strongly recommend other hotels , far superior in terms of answering customers queries and delivering a better service

"“Great Hotel – Excellent Location & Recommended!!” Just back from 4 days in NY and stayed at the New Yorker Hotel... Great hotel with a fantastic central location, right across the road from Penn Station (madison sq gardens) and Macy’s a stone throw away. It is a mere 10 min walk to Times Square too. We had a nice small cosy room on the 26th floor and it was spotless, modern and perfect for our trip. Bed was nice and cosy so no complaints at all. As I like clean comfortable rooms, I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel. We also had a view of the Empire State Building which is nice at night. Our package, which was quite reasonable for a hotel as central as this one in NY, included continental breakfast vouchers for the Tick Tock Diner which is attached to the Hotel. Although you only get tea/coffee and a croissant/bagel or Danish with the voucher, you could have breakfast and pay for the extra items which we did each morning. Although this diner is expensive it’s handy to get your breakfast before starting your big day sightseeing or shopping and you could not ask for a better location as everything is in a short walking distance from the hotel. We watched the premiership football and dined at Tir Na Nog’s Irish Bar just up beside the hotel, same side next block up which was great, had lunch there and food was lovely. We stumbled upon a fabulous restaurant called 'Ruby Tuesdays' just off top of Times Sq and from start to finish, the food, ambience and service was absolutly excellent ... I can not recommend enough as it was just lovely and also reasonably priced. We also took the Grey Line Bus Tour, which included a free trip on the yellow water taxi to Statue of Liberty which was absolutely brilliant... Our host Julie was great craic so would definitely recommend this tour. There is so much to see and do in NY and too much to mention here but we had a fabulous time and would definitely recommend the New Yorker Hotel.

Was very impressed by the cleanliness and size. Rooms look exactly like they do on the website.

Was at the hotel for Valentine's weekend and brought my son's girlfriend along because she had never stayed at this hotel. Because I wanted to give her the WOW factor I requested a room with a great view. The view was not great it was UNBELIEVABLE!!! Right outside of our suite was the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Who could have asked for better!
Anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel that is really, really clean check out the New Yorker. Everything is at your doorstep - Subway, Penn Station, shopping, food, etc. It is located at the corner of 8th Ave and 34th Street.

I took two steps from the door and there was my bed. When I complained they stated that it was because I used Expedia. Finally they offered me another room at an extra cost. They gave me 2 options and let me see them first. They were all the same size!!!! The only difference is that one room had two beds but it didn't feel any bigger. The hotel could be great.

"“Fantastic location” The hotel is art deco in appearance, but so very iconic. The lobby is looking a little tired but you feel as though you are back in time, very atmospheric. You have probably seen pictures of the famous red sign illuminated against the New York skyline.
The rooms are spacious and clean. The beds are comfortable. Wifi is available throughout the hotel. There is a diner attached to the hotel for great value breakfasts, eggs over easy, BLTs etc, typical New York fayre. More substantial meals are also available.
However, the best part about staying here is the location. Just a five minute walk to The Empire State Building in one direction, five minutes to Times Square in another and five minutes to the Hudson River and boat trips around Manhatten.

"“Great Value!” The hotel is very centrally located - close to everything, including subway entrances, Penn Station, garment district, theater district, and even the Empire State building. Got a great room rate! Our room was tucked away in a corner on the 20th floor, and while a bit small, it was perfect for us. The bathroom sparkling, the beds super comforbable, and it even had great pillows. Best of all, it was quiet! Hotel amenities included a work out room and business center. The TickTock diner next door was good for 24-hour food, but don't expect attentive service or food above average to good. 9Try the Stagedoor diner just down the block - MUCH better food and service). 
The only drawbacks to the place were a) they don't offer conditioner with the shampoo for the bathrooms, 2) the front desk people - they're either rude or just very unhappy , didn't make eye contact or smile once, and 3) the concierage was useless. We asked about a sports bar to watch a playoff game, and when we turned down her one and only suggestion (ESPN Zone, which we detest), she just shrugged. Come one! NO other options in all of NYC? She didn't even go online or check with anyone else.

"“Good Quality in NY City” My mate and I (both in our early 20's) stayed here in December of '08 on our fourth stop on a round the world trip. We were happy with our stay at the New Yorker.
We stayed in a Metro Room with two double beds. The room was small and a little cramped, but it was very comfortable and nice and warm, considering the temperature outside dipped to -10°C (or 12°F) during our stay. The room included two double beds, a widescreen plasma TV, a work desk, a chest of draws, Wi Fi internet service, a heater and a bathroom. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was adequate. With this being said, the shower was very weak in water pressure and was slightly difficult to control in terms of water temperature.
The location of the hotel was fabulous, with it being extremely close to Penn Station, which means easy access to JFK and Newark airports. The main Bus terminal was also just up the road. The hotel has restaurants on the ground floor that you can choose from (I can recommend the Tic Toc restaurant, though it can be a little pricey), or you can walk across the road and satisfy your inner child with some McDonalds. Then there are also a couple of cafes nearby where you can pick up relatively cheap breakfasts if you wish. The hotel is within 10-15mins walking distance to Times Square and about 30mins walking distance to Central Park. If you don’t want to walk, just catch the subway up or down the island. If you want to shop, then Macy’s is a couple of blocks away. If you want to go to an event, Madison Square Garden is one block away, with the Post Office directly opposite it. And if you want to get a view of the city, the Empire State Building is just a couple of blocks away as well. What more could you ask for?
The staff and service at this hotel were also very good. Our trip to NY included two stays as we were going to Niagara Falls for a day which meant we would get back into NY at about 9am one morning after not sleeping there for that night. So what we did is book a room for three nights, then check out early one morning, then book a room for the nights after we returned. Thus not having a room for the night we weren’t going to be in New York City. The only thing is that this meant possibly having to wait around for about 6 hours until we were allowed into our room. But no, the lady that originally checked us in helped us out and put a block on the room we stayed in initially so no one could use it for the night we weren’t there. Then all we had to do was bring down our bags and leave them in the luggage room ($1 per bag per day) and then come back the next day at 9am and our bags and room were ready for us. This meant showers and rest after a long bus trip which we were very grateful for.
The only complaint we would have is that on one of the days, the house maid seemed to have missed our room and consequently, we didn’t have made beds nor new towels. It really didn’t bother us too much, but it was just a little blemish on what was a very good stay.
For students or for those who are trying to keep their expenses down and don’t mind being cramped slightly, but want a good night’s sleep, a Metro Room would be for you. For older people or for those who get slightly claustrophobic, I would suggest getting a bigger room. Really, for me in New York City, you don’t spend too much time in your hotel anyway, so really, cramped or not, as long as you’ve got comfortable beds and a decent bathroom, then you’re set.
I’ve attached a couple of pictures to help perspective guests to this hotel in deciding whether a Metro Room is for them or not.
So, in all, comfortable rooms, you could get a little better with the bathroom, great location, great front counter service, means a great stay in New York City. I’ll definitely be trying to stay at the New Yorker on my next trip to New York City.",GT05,2008-12-01,122005,2009-02-06,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“An Okay Place!” We stayed at The New Yorker for 5 nights in Jaunuary 09 and on the whole we enjoyed our stay. The room was not large but was spacious enough for the 3 of us ( 2 x double beds ) and provided most comforts well enough. It was decorated just as shown in the photos on the web site to a good standard. It didn't have any tea/coffee making facilities, but i had brought our own mini jug which was well worth the hassle to have warm drinks in our room. Coffee was provided downstairs, but that was downstairs so meant going down to get a drink. I would well recommend taking your own kettle for lifes' little treats!
Staff were friendly enough and helpful, especially the door man who was most pleasant.
The Tick Tock Diner was great for breakfast and we ate here every morning.
The subway entrance was almost right outside the door so very convenient and the sights including Times Square, Empire State Building & Madison Square Gardens were very close.
On the whole our stay was a pleasant one and would go back if we find ourselves travelling to N.Y again.",TeenBathUK,2009-01-01,122005,2009-01-31,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great location, small rooms, good value in the off-season” Stayed here recently, and a great pick with regards to location. Just opposite Penn Station which has a link to the airport via Jamaica station.
The hotel was refurbished recently and it's a lovely art-deco environment and looks great. We stayed in 2 rooms (had one night with friends) and both were very small, but clean and comfortable.
A lot of NY attractions are within walking distance - Empire State Building, Times Square, theatre district, Rockefeller Center etc. Short train rides to Central Park and Chinatown. Staff were excellent. There's a good diner in the hotel open 24 hrs if you get hungry.
Would recommend it in the off-season because it's great value, too expensive (for us) in peak season.",enzoweb,2009-01-01,122005,2009-01-27,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“Good Location” The New Yorker was a hotel with a great Location. The staff was friendly and could be reached when need.

"“Best Value Hotel!” We loved this hotel! My mother and I visited New York for the first time last December. We knew nothing about the city and finally decided on this hotel mainly because of the price.
The best part was the subway's blue line (A,C,E) entrance was directly under the hotel. It was so easy to hop ona dn off the subway that we never did take a cab. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and accomodating, even updating us to a higher floor upon request so that we would have a better view. The room was small (we joked and said that they put us in the broom closet) but it was always immaculatly cleaned and well-maintained.
The Tic Tock diner in the hotel lobby was amazing --- great for breakfast and late night dinners. So convenient and not too expensive.
The hotel was within walking distance to Times Square, 5th Ave, Macy's etc. The only thing I would advise is to always take 7th Ave to and from Times Square as opposed to 8th Ave. At night 7th seemed to be much better lit and more crowded -- we felt safer.
Definetely a great value hotel for NYC!",BrittB1011,2008-12-01,122005,2009-01-16,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Okay Hotel for the Price” We just got back from 2 nights at the New Yorker (Jan 1st to 3rd). The hotel was extremely crowded for the holidays (to be expected) and there were long lines to check-in and out. Since we were checking in on New Year's our room, we were told that our room would not be ready until late in the afternoon. After asking for the manager, he promised to do his best to get us checked-in as early as possible (ended up being about 2:30pm- check-in time is supposed to be 1:00pm). We appreciated that the manager was willing to help us, but we found the other front desk staff to be rude. 
The room itself was pretty standard- clean, but tiny and with no view. The heat wasn't working very well, it would either blow really hot or cold air and we found the same happened with the shower. 
Overall, I think we got what we paid for. We paid a little less than $150 a night. In the future, I'd probably spend a little more and stay someplace nicer.",ParisGirly22,2009-01-01,122005,2009-01-07,False,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Hotel, Great Rooms, Great Location!” We stayed for Christmas and New Years, it was awesome. It was small but that's to be expected in New York City. We arrived about 5:30pm, hardly any line to check-in. It was a little pricey but we're still really happy with our stay here. We had originally booked our stay at Hotel Pennsylvania on 7th Ave but after reading all of the horrible reviews online about it we changed to the New Yorker at the last minute and boy am I glad and lucky that we did. We had a twin room with two double beds, we were facing the front of the hotel and we had a great view of the Empire State Building, it looked magical all lit up at night.
Fantastic location, 2 minute walk from the Manhattan Center, 5 minutes from Madison Square Garden, 10-15 minutes from all of the action of Times Square. It was so handy to walk from Times Square back to our hotel on New Years Eve, we went to events at the Manhattan Center and MSG while we were there too, I can't talk enough about the great location... it was perfect for us. It was a 7 minute walk from the Port Authority Bus Station too, which we used to get to an NFL game in New Jersey, $10each roundtrip, can't beat that!
Plenty of places to eat too, Grand Papaya's is a 5 minute walk down 8th Ave, they have the best Hot Dogs in NYC, good prices too. There's a 24hr bakery 3 minutes from the hotel too, great cheese pizza and even better donuts. 2 donuts of your choice for $1.25, beat that Dunkin Donuts! Not to mention, White Castle, McDonalds and Taco Bell are all minutes away, you really are spoilt for choice. There's a great Chinese place called Fo Ling you should check out too, so cheap and so good! Avoid the Tick-Tock Diner downstairs, it's a tourist trap. Overpriced and below average food, cafe34 across the road is cheaper but the burgers aren't that much better. Wendy's is across the road too, go there for burgers... yeah, like I said, lots of food options. If you want pizza, John's Pizzeria off times square is the best place to go. You'll go back to Gray's Papaya more than once though, trust me... mmmmm, 2 dogs, mustard and a large Papaya drink... awesome. Try all of their fruit drinks.
I'd absolutely stay here again, if you want to attend a few sporting events, concerts, broadway musicals or just be near Times Square, this hotel is for you. The concierge downstairs was very helpful too, helped us with broadway times, prices, movie times, different shop locations, different phone numbers. They were great.",ADRTraveller3000,2008-12-01,122005,2009-01-07,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good Hotel - Well worth staying in...” We just returned from a 5 night stay in the hotel ""The New Yorker"". I have been told a lot of horror stories about New York hotels, but this hotel is really neat and clean. Room is not a great size but will do for a city break. Rooms are nicely decorated and all have a nice size LCD tv. Beds are comfy and shower facilities are good also. Down stairs it also has its own 24hr diner, food is good but slight pricey. For best value breakfast i would recommend ""Rock Cafe"". Full English with tea/coffee $16 per person. Pancake in the hotel will cost almost $10. 
I recommend this hotel to any one traveling to New York. It’s very close to Time Square, only about 5-10 min walk. Also has Penn Station right out side the hotel so you can easily travel down to the finical district, this enables you to see the Statue of Liberty.
i would rate this hotel more than a 3 Star. You will enjoy!!",mitch747,2008-12-01,122005,2009-01-05,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Location, Good Hotel” We booked last minute for NYC and chose this hotel as it was on offer through Expedia.
We were very pleased with the location (right by the subway) the room was not huge but we didn't go to New York to sit in a room. The tv was fine with cable and the bathrooms were clean. Check in was fast. 
The hotel is great for people staying in NYC for shopping, sights etc. If you did need taxis and not the subway there are always a few outside waiting.
The only downside is waiting for a lift/elevator in the morning it gets very busy.",joncurtis19,2008-12-01,122005,2009-01-02,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Hotel” My wife and I stayed at the NewYorker Hotel from the 22/12/08 to the 28/12/08, and would recommend the Hotel to everyone. 
The reception staff were very good and the maid service was equally as good. Although the room was small it was clean and comfortable and had recently been refurbished. Our room number was 2927. 
The Hotel location was fantastic and proved to one of the highlights of our stay, everywhere is accessible, Times square, Macys, Empire State building etc, and we walked to China town from the Hotel on Christmas day.
If you were not into walking the Penn Street Station is minutes from the hotel and for $4 return, you could travel to the World trade centre.
The only dissapointment we had was at the Tick Tock Diner which is attached to the hotel, beware it's very expensive, an example for you is that I had an English Breakfast and my wife had 3 pancakes ,we both had one cup of tea. The cost $43. Extortionate. 
Another tip is if you see a Police Officer eating in a local fast food place, it means that the quality of food is good and the cost is reasonable.
We found a great chinease restaurant called the Golden City it's just around the corner from the hotel opposite the Camera shop. Although from the outside it didn't look great the food was exceptional and the staff were very helpful.
Please also make sure you know the cost of an item at a shop before you go to pay as you may find the asking price depends on your accent.
We also found to our cost at Macys that several full price items are mixed in with items which are on a display at 30% and 50% off. It could not have just been a mistake by someone placing the odd full priced item beside the others, as there were perhaps ten or more of the full priced items in the same area.

"“Great Christmas experience” We have just returned from a 6 day holiday in New York and WOW what a time we had.
The hotel is great, perfectly positioned and fantastic views. We stayed in room 3724 and we had a view of the Empire State Building and out the corner window we could see Hudson River.
I know you only sleep there but how great it was to end the day looking out over the city and looking at the lights and when waking in the morning to see the sunrise. We had no problem checking in, it was quick, pleasant and easy. Staff were friendly both at the desk, doorman and info. We never waited long for a lift even though the hotel was very full. Every morning we started the day with me fetching Starbucks coffee from across the road for the 3 of us. Then we would venture off into the heart of it all, which took max 15min slow walk to Times Square or 20min to Central Park or even better when wanting to go a bit further we would take the subway, the entrance being next to the hotel on the corner for lines A,B & C or next block up for lines 1,2 &3. Macy's is also 1 block away, Madison Square Garden on the next block to right of hotel, movie house around the corner and of course if you have a child or hubby like mine that enjoy Mac Donalds then it is easy as there is a 24 hour one right across the road next to Starbucks. For odd tit bits or medicine, there is a 24hour Chemist on the corner. So as you can see everything is situated around or near the hotel if not on the doorstep. I strongly recommend ""The Stage Door"" 1 block down on the right, opposite Madison Square Gardens for the best sandwiches, wraps etc. Hardrock Cafe is great for buffet breakfast at $16 each and would also recommend Ellens Stardust Diner with singing waiters, this is 10min away on corner 50th or 51st ave and Broadway (confirm address with hotel) We took a train to New Jersey for a shopping spree at one of their many malls. When arriving at JFK we decided we would try the subway instead of paying $45 for a taxi it cost us $2 each, we took a Air Train to Jamaica Station and from there we took line A to Penn Station which comes out at the back door of the hotel, this took aprox 40 min which apparently is the same time a taxi would take. At any time we were unsure or needed to be shown in the right direction we were helped by very friendly Americans, what lovely people, always willing to help. Finanlly a great thank you to Kristina and Patricia for answering all my emails and allocating the fantastic room.

"“New Yorker Hotel” The New Yorker Hotel is conveniently located between Penn Station and Times Square. The location is great for first time tourists, with rates that are more reasonable during the weekdays. I don’t live far so, I took the train into Penn Station. It’s a short easy walk from there. The rooms offer the basics: a bed, TV, bathroom, and closet space. I stayed in a room with two double beds. It was tight, but enough space…especially since all you need it for is sleep. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. The room was clean, the water pressure was good, and thankfully there was an iron for my wrinkled clothes. Check-in and check-out were easy. For the most part, the staff was helpful. I was only really disappointed by one thing…the concierge. She was horrible. I stood in line with several people for a while…and all I wanted was a phone number to make reservations to a restaurant I heard about. She was very inefficient with the people in front of me, and didn’t actually give them good advice about a Broadway play, but I kept my mouth shut. I was frustrated, but talked to people in line to pass time. She looked over from time to time and asked me more than once if I was with the group I was talking with, and I continued to say no. After waiting for about 20 frustrating minutes, she got to me and googled the number. I suggested a way to search for it, and she cut me off saying ""why don’t you do it yourself?"" I was shocked. I merely made a suggestion. If she was frustrated by her clearly inefficient methods, why should she take it out on a guest? Do not use the concierge here for advice…it’s not worth it.",chrisco447,2008-12-01,122005,2008-12-30,False,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Pleasantly Surprised” My mother in law and I traveled to NYC for the first time to see a concert that I dragged her to. I read the reviews once we booked the trip and was a little worried. The night before we were due to leave, my mother in law called the hotel to find out what kind of restaurants were in the immediate area. She was very helpful, and also told my mil that our room was quite small. My mil said as long as it had two beds and a bathroom and the room was clean, we would be just fine.
When we checked in the hotel, the desk attendant was very helpful. We were comforted when we found out that you have to show your key before you get to the elevators. We were told our room was on the 40th floor. Lo and behold, it was on the top floor! We walked in and were extremely satisfied...until we only saw one bed!! But then we realized that the couch was a pullout. Crisis diverted. The room was very clean, the t.v.'s were great, and the view was SPECTACULAR!! I could see out of one window and see madison square garden, the sole reason why we were there. (to see NKOTB which was amazing, by the way) Oh, I was a little worried about the pull-out, but it was pretty comfortable. Also, the pillows are WONDERFUL!!
We left to get dinner and walk around a bit, and when we got back, water had gotten in through one of the windows from a heavy rainstorm while we were out. We called the front desk and they came up pretty quickly. I was worried we would have to change rooms, but we didn't.
The Tick Tock Diner was great for breakfast, but not so much for dinner. The night we went service was a bit slow and it was a little difficult to find something that was appealing.
All of the staff were very helpful. We booked one of the double-decker tours and arranged for transportation back to the airport. Everything went very smoothly.
I am trying to go back to NYC for my 30th birthday next year. Regardless of when I come back, I hope to stay at the New Yorker again and get the same kind of room.

We had a room on the 37th floor. As said before by other guests the rooms can b small but you dont go to stay in hotel room. Bathroom was ok but not a modern as room and rest of the hotel we had seen.
Had a very full few days which ment we needed a good breakfast. Tick tock diner was very good for this and reasonably priced. We ate once in coopers that was good aswell.
Hotel is in a very good location, a few blocks from most of the main attractions and in walking distance of others. We found a briitish pub in greenwich and was chatting to an ex brit which was good as we found out a few more things about new york. If you are thinking of using the yellow cabs make sure you know the street and avenue as some taxi drivers have no idea where places are.

"“Cramped and tasteless” Booked by expedia, the hotel on the website seemed great and I was very much looking forward to it. Hoever, upon arrival at the hotel, we were waiting at reception for 15 minutes before the man behind the desk decided to get off the phone. we were then shown to our room ( if you could call it a room and not a broom cupboard) which was supposedly for 2 people, with a single bulb in the ceiling, a bed barely big enough for one and a view of a brick wall, and mould in the bathroom. When we phoned down to reception to tell them we were unhappy with the acomodation, we were told by the staff that this was 'our problem' and that we could not be moved from the room. The rudeness of the staff and their unwillingness to help us further angered me, and we moved hotels imediately to the Paramount after a heated discussion with expedia. The paramount was only a 5 minute walk way, much more spacious and in general a much better hotel.

"“Great location” Stayed there in Oct 07 for 8 nights. The honeymoon trip to New York was great overall, but the hotel was not very impressive at that time. The furniture was outdated as we stayed in one of the old rooms, the corridors were dirty and some of the staff not very helpful. The hotel was in the middle of the renovation period and works were in place every day. On the other hand, the location is great, opposite Madissson Square Garden and very close to Macys, the metro stop is just under the hotel, and the view from our room (19th floor) to the Empire State building was magnificent. I guess that today, after the renovation is over and the rooms are all new, it is a very good choice to stay in New York.

"“What a wow” Chose the New Yorker for a Mother/Daughters girlie week, seeing the sites and shopping. The Hotel was wonderful, the staff were great most of them had a good sense of humour. Our thanks and admiration to the transportation desk who were prepared to help and give advice at any hour (including 5.30am after our bemused brains woke us up at 3.30 and got us on the move on day 1). 
The room was excellent, the beds very comfortable, AND a bathroom that provided plenty of steaming hot water.
Despite the queue and influx of people, the reception desk staff were quick, efficient and also had a sense of humour.
Disappointed at not having drink making facilities in the room a quick call to housekeeping remedied the problem and we were provided with a coffee maker and kept with a plentiful supply of coffee and creamer.
No need to comment on the location, it had it all, everyone staying there has said you could not do better.
We are all waiting to see if we can get back there again as quickly as possible
Big disappointment, beware of some Newark taxi drivers, we were taken for a ride.

"“Great Location, Solid Hotel” I stayed at the New Yorker in mid July, primarily due to its vacinity to Penn Station (I took the Amtrak Maple Leaf from TO) and for its reasonable price quotes on-line. Overall I was very impressed with this hotel.
First off, due to weather issues, I was unable to check-in until about 1130pm...no worries, the hotel staff was great and I was checked-in within minutes. The location to Penn Station is unreal, it's a block north of the Northwest entrance. 
Now for those who are expecting a huge room, well for a single bed, it's not big at all, but since you will likely spend about 80-85% of your time in the city, it's fine. The room was really clean and the cleaning staff addressed all of my questions/problems I had (btw I only had on problem with a tap that was leaking the first night and that was addressed the next morning).
Since this hotel is on top of the A,C and E subway and down the street from the 1,2 and 3 lines you can get anywhere at anytime. I was able to get to all the sites and attractions I wanted to in relatively quick times. 
My primary reason for the trip was to see Yankee and Shea stadiums and both aren't too bad to get to from the hotel via the subway. 
To be honest I really just slept at the hotel and was all over the city the rest of the time (MSG, Yankee and Shea Stadium, St Patrick's Cathedral, WTC site, etc.). 
Here are the main pros and cons from the stay:
Pros:
Location- see above
Security- you have to show you pass to get to the elevators all the time
Cleanliness- very clean and comfortable room
Access to the subway- See above, it's right below
Access to attractions- down the street from MSG and the Empire State Building. Also for those shoppers, Macy's is about 2 blocks west
Value- For what I paid+location, it was excellent
Cons:
Room size- again this is a minor con, but I'm sure some people need a large room....this place might not do that for you
Air conditioner- It was a bit noisy and it was really, really cold (even on a low fan)
Bathroom- although it was clean and a fair size, it was outdated (green tiles and what looked like a sink from the 40's)
Cable TV- Hardly an channels, but again NYC is the city that never sleeps, so who needs TV,
Overall the cons were very minimal and the pros far outweigh them. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and already have to my parents.",tigersfan23,2008-07-01,122005,2008-12-21,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

all staff members pleasant and smiley. happy to help at any time of day or night. 
it cost around $50-$60 from JFK airport to hotel but that is including tips. you have to tip for everything in NY.

"“Great Location” Just returned from a short break to New York. The New Yorker 
Hotel has just been refurbished so was looking very good.
My friend and I stayed in a two double bedded metro room,which to be honest was quite small but after all we only slept there!
The room was spotlessly clean and the beds were lovely and comfortable.It would have been nice to have tea and coffee making facilities though.
Attached to the hotel was the Tick Tock diner from which you could get a delicious breakfast which would set you up for the day of sightseeing and shopping.
The location of the New Yorker is fantastic with Macys and The Empire State Building just around the corner and most other attractions within walking distance.
The Christmas lights were stunning and to top it all it snowed,all in all a fantastic time.",Liz-e08,2008-12-01,122005,2008-12-19,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

We were very late getting in due to weather delayed flights, checked in around 11.30pm, no problems, staff all smiling and helpful. We were the first ones to use a renovated room on the 21st floor, was roomy enough, the bed was heaven, everything worked like it was supposed to! Hey, we were in NYC!! We werent living all day and night in the room! We could walk everywhere that end of town, Broadway, Times Square, Central Park, and plenty of shopping and food close by ( try the pizza slices 2 blocks down - delicious), and was just a bus ride down to the financial district, China Town, Statten Island Ferry, Ground Zero and the Statue of Liberty etc. And when it was time to leave, a quick walk to Penn Station for a train! The free wireless internet was a bonus as well, very high speed.

"“New Yorker Rocks but Brigid is scary!” Just back from a business trip to NY staying at the New Yorker. Know the New Yorker well as this is one of the regular hotels we use in the city. I was in a newly refurbished room which was goregous in terms of decor with flat screen tv etc mounted on wall but the room was TINY! I basically has 1-2ft around the bed! The bathroom was also redone but again tiny.... and we were paying close to $300 a night!
Apart from the size of the room the hotel is in an amazing location in midtown with the A C and E train running straight from the corner of the hotel. From this subway station you can connect to all other lines. 
The hotel is also on 34th Street which came in very handy during black Friday meaning I could shop till I dropped and was only 2 or 3 blocks from the hotel to drop off and start again.
The only thing that annoyed me about the hotel was the front desk manager Brigid. Not a very nice lady at all and i'm sorry if you have had to deal with her in the past or if you have to deal with her in the future. She is scandanavian and very short and rude! I had problems with the payment of my room i.e. they didn't take payment from our corporate amex at the time of booking and I never brought it with me as I had the hotel voucher - she made a big stramash about how the room wasnt paid and that I wouldn't be staying there unless I paid £1600 US upfront! Was so angry as i was just off a transatlantic flight and the fact that our office in the UK was now closed was irelevant to her. I eventually paid, which was refunded in the morning - but she did try and hold my money until I checked out - total chancer. Felt to sorry for her staff on the front desk as they seemed to be doing all they could without having to ask for her assistance - and you should see the face of thunder if she had to come out front!
Ok rant over! Vile Woman lol!

"“loved the new yorker hotel for thanksgiving” concerned about reviews, I asked for a high floor. I was given a rooom in the 28th floor. Small but ok for the price I had paid....I thought.The pipes in the next room where a little bit noisy so we asked for a change. Staff more than helpful, moved us in less tah 1 hour to floor 29th to a bigger room even with an excellent view....without paying a single pence extra.
tips: if you are arriving to JFK, take the airtrain, change in Jamaica and take the LLRail to Penn station.it will take you no more 30' the
whole journey.Penn station is in front of the hotel.
The diner next to the hotel is overpriced and crowed.The coffee shop 31, in the corner of the maddison sq garden is great and only 2 metres from the hotel.

"“Excellent Place To Stay.” Spent the weekend here (Friday - Monday) and thought it was an excellent place to stay. Thoroughly recommended.
The room (albeit a bit small, Queen's Metro) was wonderful, very Art-Deco, though the bathroom in places looked a bit tired and being quite tall, the bath was a bit small! But as the we only really used to room as a place to stay it was more than adequate with an excellent heater.
The rooms above the 25th floor have recently been refurbished (ours had) and the hotel in general was extremely clean and well presented. I loved the Art-Deco style.
Check in was efficient if, a little impersonnal though they gave plenty of information. They also look after your bags once you've checked out for $2 allowing you to do some last minute sightseeing/shopping.
The information desk was more than helpful in giving directions and finding out things for you to do.
The Tic-Toc diner was alright for food (Breakfast), clean and well presented even if it got a little busy at times.
There was some work going on at the time in the main foyer though this didn't really intrude on the overall atmosphere.",b2dan,2008-11-01,122005,2008-12-04,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good Value, Great Location” For those that have never visited NYC - or perhaps just haven't visited in a very long time, it is easy to be blown away by pricing for accommodations. Most of the time you end up spending what you would for a high-end hotel in Anywhere, USA and find out that it's just a matchbox hotel room that might have clean sheets if you're lucky and in a questionably convenient location. 
Well the great thing about this recently renovated hotel is that it's a great location, the rooms are actually decently sized (by NYC standards), and the upgraded amenities help it stand out from just an average hotel - and to seal the deal the rates really are not bad. So if you're looking for a good value in the city that will afford you the comforts of home with a great location without breaking the bank, then the New Yorker is a good choice.",Kaefer78,2008-08-01,122005,2008-12-03,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“New York - New Yorker - Fantastic” Am going to say what most of the other reviewers have said!
The hotel was in a great location, just a few blocks from Macy's, Times Square, opposite Madison Squres gardens and Pensylvania Station. The Port Authority Bus Station was also only a few minutes away to get you to Woodbury Common, Shopping Outlet.
Overall could not fault the hotel - Clean & Modern Rooms, room enough for 2/3 girls and lots of shopping!!
We has rooms 2039/2041 and had great views of the city.
The reception staff were helpful when needed, good security (you have to show your key card to get to lifts).
Handy Diner on site served usual American style meals, or for a cheaper option there is a Starbucks close by or a 24hr McDonalds opposite!!
Would definatley use this hotel again and reccommend to friends.",stoneywatko,2008-11-01,122005,2008-12-02,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Cant fault this hotel” After reading some of the reviews on here i, like alot of others was a little apprehensive about staying at the New Yorker. I should not have worried, we had a suite on the 25th floor and it was AMAZING. The views were stunning, decor impeccable, service pleasent. The location was fabulous both from a sightseeing perpective and a shopping one. The only minor changes i would have made, there is no room service, i would have expected it in such a hotel especially when there are no tea facilities in the room. Also we paid for b+b and the breakfast spread was a little disappointing.. however the view from the 39th floor dining room made up for it!. overall a fab hotel x",beckbee33,2008-11-01,122005,2008-11-24,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent Location and good value for money” Hi All,
Slightly jeg lagged still from our superb trip to New York, so bear with me as I blog on!!
We booked a Queen Room through expedia in this hotel and after searching for a couple of weeks this looked the best in terms of location and price. 
I emailed the hotel before to ask to be put as high as possible in the hotel, we were on the 35th floor with superb view of the Hudson River. They did this at no extra cost. The rooms are clean and newly refurbished. They are small, but hey this is NYC and you won't spend much time there. Ladies- I sent my other half down to the bar to get him out of my hair while I got ready to go out as there isnt a great deal of room.
The staff are very friendly and helped to recommend a good mexican restaurant to us. I felt very safe and they will check your room card before letting you upstairs.
The Tick Tock diner below the hotel is great for breakfast and lunch. It's quite pricey due to it's location but food was always excellent. I ordered a room service breakfast one day and it arrived on time and hot food etc.
The hotel bar Coopers is nice but it's quite pricey at $7 a beer so beware we nearly passed out when we bought a drink there!!
Right next to a main line subway station which is handy, you will get tired walking loads in New York, it's a bit complex to navigate but saves money in taxi fares at $2 for a single ride.
To get to the airport there is a transportation desk at reception, if you order a cab from there beware as it's $20 more expensive than getting a yellow cab however it means you don't have to hail one yourself (in the cold wind if winter), you can gurantee it turns up and the transportation staff will be able to factor in enough time for traffic as we travelled to airport in rush hour. It was also a nice black car with leather seats, it kind of finished the trip of for us in style. For the extra $20 as well they will check you in and print your boarding card so much easier than running round trying to find a internet cafe.
All round great hotel, would go back again.",happydudders1,2008-11-01,122005,2008-11-23,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Basic but comfortable” My husband and I have just returned from our stay in the New Yorker.I read lots of reviews before we went and thought I would just add a few thoughts of my own.
Firstly, as it was our first trip to NYC I booked the Super Shuttle minibus to colllect us from JFK and take us to our hotel. I thought it would save a bit of hassle on arrival but we would have been just as well off by arranging it when we got there as we ended up hanging around and travelling with people who hadn't booked at all. The minibus held 11 people and it was full and cramped. It was also a very bumpy ride! Admittedly it was cheaper than a taxi ( about $17 each on the bus compared with $45 for a taxi) but less convenient and definitely less comfortable!!
On arrival at the hotel we decided to upgrade from our Expedia metro queen room. it cost us an extra £25 a night but it was an updated room on the 24th floor with views towards the Hudson river.As has been said many times the room was small but did have a 5 foot comfortable bed.
I had read that there were no tea making facilities and as a pair that can't function without our morning cuppa we took a small travel kettle with us ( it cost £10 in Argos). We were very glad of it - not just in the morning but on our return to the hotel when we had spent the day sightseeing.
The location of the hotel really is second to none. I thought people were exaggerating when they said it was ""round the corner from"" Macey's, Empire State building etc but it is and was very central for many other attractions.
Like many others we would highly recommend taking the bus tours around the city. We went with the blue buses ( City sights) but there are also red buses ( run by Greyline). We found a disadvantage with the blue bus when we sat upstairs at the front as there was a bar across the window which cut down visibility and made it difficult to take photos. We noticed (afterwards) that the red buses had bigger, clear front windows. On the other hand the blue buses ran an excellent nght tour which took us across the Manhatten bridge into Brooklyn where we saw the magnificent Manhatten skyline. Well worth going - even in the rain.We don't think the red buses actually went across the river.
It is much cheaper to sign up with one or the other company for all the tours so you pay your money and make your choice.
All in all we had a wonderful holiday. We felt safe walking in the city, found the people polite and the streets clean and we would definitely stay in the New Yorker again.",Seeaitch_8,2008-11-01,122005,2008-11-21,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great Location!!!!!!” After reading various negative reviews of The New Yorker, I was very tempted to cancel the hotel, and search for another one, I was pleased that I didn't. The taxi fare to the hotel from JFK is a fixed rate of $45 plus approx $5 for the toll. Check in was quick and straight forward...staff weren't very smiley, but I wasn't planning to hang around for a chat. Security at the hotel is great, guests need to show their room key to get past. I was allocated a room on the 22nd floor, there are plenty of lifts. The room was a double/double, side view, a double/double room does make the room appear a bit smaller, but it's not too bad. The room was very clean, bathroom was clean, and more than enough towels are supplied. The hairdrier is quite powerful, there is only one negative thing I can think of, and that is that the shower isn't powerful, but again it's bearable. Shampoo and Body Gel bottles are supplied and replaced if necessary.
Location: the location of the hotel is fantastic...minutes walk to Macys, and The Empire State Building, come out of the hotel, turn right and than left at the traffic lights...walk for a couple of mins and you're at Macy's. 
Tick Tock Dinner is to the right of the hotel as you're walking out, nice place, we had a $5 tip added on at the end of the bill. Another great restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner is The Stage Door, again to the right of the hotel, cross the road. Great menu and reasonable prices, good service.
I would also recommend a cafe on 672 Eighth Avenue, cheap, and the food is very fresh and prepared in front of you. Come out of the hotel, cross the road, turn left and walk for about 7/8 mins.
The hotel does not charge to the room. 
The hotel bar is pricey!!!!!!!! But does play good 80's music.
Check out - it might be worth checking with the company you've booked the hotel with to see if the price you're paying includes local taxes. Our final bill had a total of 13% added per night on top of our bill. If you have time to kill before your flight, you can leave your luggage with the hotel for a charge of 50c per case/bag, and the same charge when collecting your case/bag. The hotel taxi to the airport is around $70, would recommend pulling a taxi off the street for the flat rate of $45.
Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",Nicky38,2008-11-01,122005,2008-11-19,False,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Fab Location, Great Place to stay ******” I went with my boyfriend and parents for my 21st birthday and we could not have picked a better spot! This was our first visit to New York City and one i will never forget!
When we arrived at JFK we had booked a car through the hotels link for a company called New Yorker Rides (they are based in the actual hotel) such nice guys! The car was just what we had asked for as we had 8 bags (2 each) and didnt think that a yellow cab would be big enough! It cost $135 but well worth the money we were at the hotel in about 30mins and the driver was letting us know of all the shopping, sites etc.
We arrived at the hotel around 12.30pm, although check in time is 3pm we thought we would just see if the rooms were ready and they were - perfect start to the holiday! 
The rooms were ample sizes for what we needed them for - yes probably not the biggest rooms we had seen but to be honest you only really sleep in them! we were on the 26th floor and as we were around the back we hardly heard any traffic noice (apart from the odd police car) and the honking of the horns (quite funny actually as there are signs all around the city saying no honking - fine of $350!!) 
Tick tock diner is a must! pancakes are to die for and the service was fantastic (apart from one grumpy blonde waitress who didnt no how to smile let alone be polite!)
Like i said location i great! 2 blocks up the street is empire state building - if you can find a guy who is selling the multi tickets they are outside e.s.b. the tickets are for sky ride and observation tower $48 but well worth it - normal queue 2hrs we queued 1hr and done both! if the weather permits it go up at night such a stunning view! 
Times Square was just a few blocks away and so was macy's - if you go macys go to the visitors centre and get your 11% discount card valid for the month - great savings! 
On our first day we bought a 2 day bus pass for the grey line buses (red in colour) best thing we did and it saved our legs as it takes you to all the places you want to see - there is another company that does run blue buses they are also good - reason we went for grey line was because we got free boat ride (1hr cruse) arond statue of liberty and also went up the hudson river.
Ice skating is on at the moment we first went to rockafella centre but found that it was way too expencive $30 each all together and really packed - the tree lights go on 3rd dec i think.
So we decided to go central park and have a look (it on the south side of the park)- much better a bigger rink and come to about $40 for both of us (boots n locker hire inc) and to our surprise a film was being recorded there so we could be famous lol 
The one thing i was looking forward to the whole holiday was a horse and carrage ride around central park and i was not dissapointed $40 for about 15 mins but a great experience! i was also happy to see that the horses were not skinny and were able to stop and have a drink at the designated fountains around the park - we didnt feel that the ride was rushed at all!
For those of you who want Tiffanys its not got a huge sign outside it so look out! it on 5th Ave east 57th street and the sterling Silver Tiffany bits are on 3rd floor (braclets range from $210 up, Earings $175 and necklaces range from $300 - so get your guys to start saving!)
We again got car from new yorker rides back to JFK cost $75 but these prices do inc taxes and tolls - again great car nice driver and very prompt! Yellow cabs do have a sign on them saying $45 flat fair but we met quite a few people who had done that from the airport and got charged $80 not inc tolls and of course you have to tip aswel so this seemed more sensible!

"“Very enjoyable and friendly” Stayed at this hotel from November 03 to 06, 2008. Great hotel in NYC, close to everything. All staff at hotel,staff at New Yorker Rides (John Sr. and Jr.) and the staff at Tick Tock Diner were all very friendly and helpful. Yes the room and washroom was small but that is to be expected in NYC for a double/double room, it was the size I expected after researching many hotels in Manhatten. Washroom could have used a more updated tub surround and toilet but the sink and ammendities within it were usual hotel standard. We were happy to have our room on the 19th floor but it was inside the indent of the building so we never had a view. I did not ask to change rooms or upgrade because we were going to get our views from our excursions around the city, did not plan to spend much time in the room. Beds were very comfortable which is the most important to me and my back, especially after galivanting around NYC all day and night. Great food and service at the Tick Tock Diner, but of course it cannot be compared to the ""Maze By Gordon Ramsay At The London"". Great breakfast to get your day started and excellent variety of choices to end your day. I highly recomend using the ""New Yorker Rides"" transportation services from the airports to hotels, only $25 more than a cabby and much more comfortable and enjoyable, thank you Hazeus. I am kind of glad you hurt your knee playing ball in the majors, otherwise you would never have realized your true calling in life. The security at ""The New Yorker"" was superb, the friendly faces were always inviting. I have stayed in many hotels and resorts, and although this was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in, the friendly service beats out the size of the room. This hotel and staff completed our trip and I would recomend it to others who adventure to the big apple.",adventurer03,2008-11-01,122005,2008-11-16,False,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Worst Customer Service Ever” I am dumbfounded by the lack of customer service. My wife stayed at this hotel recently and one night developed a pounding headache. She could barely speak she was in so much pain and asked me to call the front desk to have them send up aspirin (I was back home). I called the front desk and was informed they could not send up aspirin or any other head ache medicine, but could call 911. After much pleading, they still refused to send any medicine to her room ""she should walk across the street and buy it herself"". I kid you not. Even though she was in too much pain to make a call herself, their solution was to call 911 or have her leave the hotel to buy her own medicine. 
It gets worse. After trying to find any person at the New Yorker hotel who cared enough about customer service to take my wife aspirin, I finally gave up and called the drug store across the street from the hotel and begged them to deliver aspirin to her room. They gladly did this. I then called the front desk of the New Yorker hotel and asked them to pay the delivery person in cash and charge that to my wife's room They refused to do this too! - ""it's against policy"". So, not only would they not deliver aspirin to a sick guest, they would not pay the delivery person and charge it to my wife's room. 
I will go out of my way from here on out to never, ever, ever stay in the New Yorker Hotel.",David_HChicago,2008-11-01,122005,2008-11-16,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.1,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Fantastic Locationwould definately book again” We have been in New York several times and had always stayed in reasonably good hotels! After reading some reports on this website about the hotel, we were a little apprehensive. We chose the hotel because we were going to a fight in MSG and the location was excellent!!Any worries went out the window as soon as we walked in..foyer is very impressive even though there is still some renovations going on. Check in was pleasant, we had asked for a corner room in advance and were given one on the 26th Floor..the rooms are smaller than those at home but i think its worth remembering that when most people from Ireland/UK go to New York its usually a tourist/shopping holiday...the only time we were in our room was to shower and sleep!!We found the staff very pleasant especially Samira who was a gem!!so helpul and friendly,,,she was a great help to my boyfriend when he was arranging my engagement ring (a FANTASTIC surprise for me!!) Tick Tock diner provided a lovely breakfast selection as we chose to eat a big meal at the start of the day to keep us going...there are plenty of other options around the hotel though if this doesn't suit!!Fantastic location, right beside MSG and ten minutes to Times Square, ESB, etc!The whole experience was very positive from the doormen, bell check, guest information, security to the front of house staff...i found that if you treat people how you want to be treated, the experience is usually positive!!Im saying this because i was witness to some unnecessarily rude guest behaviour!!relax, you're on holiday!!

"“Room with a great view” We stayed 6 nights in one of the upper floors' renovated rooms (starting at floor 25). Request was to get Empire States Building view, but of course initially it was the Hudson side. Next day we moved, but it did require quite some persistance in dealing with the front desk staff. After the move the room on the 35th floor was worth the money, even if I still find $350 per night expensive (incl tax).
The room and hotel were clean, great bed and good location. Renovation was done while retaining original features, even though sometimes it wasn't clear whether it had just been done to lower renovation costs.

"“Location Fantastic!” It was a few years ago that I was at this hotel but the location is fantastic. So close to everything in midtown. The price isn't too bad either (at least when I booked). 
Yes the rooms are small but they're functional - though probably not for a family. Mostly we had nowhere to put all our purchases!! :) 
The bathrooms are small too but completely updated. We had a corner room with views out both sides. The radiators clanked a bit. 
Getting to the room was a bit of a maze. It is an old hotel where I think rooms have been sliced in half (thirds maybe!!) to make more rooms. Our was at the end of a number of turns and long hallways. But like I said - location is fantastic and I don't go to NYC to stay in the hotel. 
I've also stayed at the Embassy Suites near Wall Street and the Waldorf Astoria and while the Ramada is nowhere near as nice looking a hotel, the staff were great and the rooms were cozy and served their purpose.",JupiterZowie,2003-10-01,122005,2008-11-13,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Disappointing” Just returned from 3 nights at the new Yorker hotel.
After styaing in some ""Boutique "" hotels in New York, where the rooms are very small I was expecting a larger sized room, however the rooms are very small as are the bathrorooms. They have been refurbished, so the decoration is quite good, but the bathrooms are still very old. They have painted over the tiles to give them a facelift!! the showers were very poor.
Staff not very efficient on the front desk. Didn't get a fax until, the folowing day, even though I questioned the flashing message button on my phone!!
The location is good if you want to be near to Macy's for shopping or madisson square gardens.
It's a shame they didn't make more of the 1920's bulding it could have been very stylish.",coolblue-7,2008-11-01,122005,2008-11-10,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Refurbished bathroom, if you call painting over the old tiles refurbishment. Paid extra for larger room but same bathroom so I guess there all the same.
Please note the hotel has few facilities for guest use ie Tick Tock Diner is off the street as is bar and you cannot charge to your room. Returning to hotel just before departure to find ladies toilet in basement locked shut as was facility on third floor and que for toilet in Tick Tock Diner my wife was not pleased.

"“Great stay at the New Yorker” I would recommend the New Yorker to anyone who is having a short stay in New York. It is well placed for all sight seeing and Macys is a five minute walk.
Our room was cleaned extremely well each day, but we did make a point of leaving a 2 dollar tip each time (cheap at the price).
We found the ladies in the information, very helpful and booked most of our trips with her. The reception staff were a bit stuffy, but it might have just been the New York attitude. We asked for a room with a view and were given one on the 36th floor overlooking the Empire State building. We were very impressed by the hotel security, as one evening we had not closed our door properly. Security came up to point this out to us after checking we were the correct occupants. 
I would recommend the open topped bus tours if you want to see a lot in a short time. Booking through the hotel we also got a boat trip around the Statue of Liberty thrown in.

"“Location is everything” I have just stayed at the New Yorker for 4 nights – 19 to 23 October. This was booked before I read some of the varying reviews here, and I have to say that your opinion will be dependant on your expectations.
If your preference is for the hotel to BE the holiday, then you may be disappointed. However, if the hotel is just a base for the holiday, then I don’t think you will be disappointed.
Firstly, the hotel is currently undergoing renovation, so expect some daytime construction noise – however if you’re in the hotel during the day, then maybe you aren’t doing it right? We had a double/double room on the 19th floor (myself, my wife and son). This was a refurbished room, and had clearly been two separate rooms at one point, as it had two bathrooms and two closets. It was very spacious and comfortable with two queen size beds and a large flat screen TV. Free wireless internet is available. Note that the rooms do not have tea/coffee making facilities, although I believe you can request it. Our room was on the north (35th Street) side and was so quiet that it was almost impossible to believe where we were – very little traffic noise was evident. The room position (see photo of floor plan) did mean that we had very little in the way of view though – again, we weren’t planning on spending much time in the room so it wasn’t an issue. If you want a view, request an upper floor room or one on a corner – I was told this costs an extra $30 per night. Two restaurants in the hotel – Coopers (which we didn’t try) and the Tick Tock Diner, which we used every morning – good food. Note, there are a lot of cheaper places for breakfast around (easy to spend $40-$50 for 3 people here), but it was convenient and the waffles were delicious!
The best thing about the New Yorker though, is its location. One block from Madison Square Garden and Macy’s. Two blocks from the Empire State Building. Times Square, Broadway, Grand Central, NY Public library, Rockefeller Plaza, Fifth Avenue, the Flatiron – all in easy walking distance. About 1 mile to Central Park. There’s a subway stop right at the hotel if you need to go further. Using Google Earth, I worked out that we walked 22 miles in four days there, although it didn’t feel as much as that. Walking around also felt very safe, even at night (more so than central London).
Some people have commented about rude and unhelpful staff at the hotel. I wouldn’t go that far, but some (especially front of house) could be described as being indifferent. Room cleaners and diner staff were better. I get the feeling that this is a general NYC attitude, as we came across it in several places. Get though their personal ”walls”, though and it gets better.
A couple of local eateries to try-
Andrews Diner (just west on opposite side of 34th) – Good basic food – apparently good for breakfast, but didn’t get a chance to try it.
Shutters Café (1 ½ blocks west on 34th) – excellent food, but don’t look too closely at the décor. Looks the sort of place the locals use.
Stagedoor (1 block south on 8th) – good food, large portions.
W Café (corner of 5th and 36th, so further afield but on a good route to places listed above) – the best sandwiches, etc, we found anywhere.
One general tip (as a first time visitor). Empire State is obviously a must, but the one thing you can't see of course is the ESB itself. Do it in the daytime, but then do the Rockefeller (Top of the Rock) at night. That way you get to see the ESB all lit up, and the overall view is arguably better.",BigAl42,2008-10-01,122005,2008-10-28,False,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.1,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Horrible experience” We stayed at the New Yorker because it was walking distance from Jacob Javits. I won't make that mistake again. I had to wait in line for at least fifteen minutes just to be brusquely checked in. The place is drab and dreary, overall. When I got to my tiny room, with a bathroom that had no place to even put a toothbrush and black hairs in the tub (not kidding!), I realized that the temp was freezing and that the heater was broken. It took three telephone calls just to get someone to show up! On my first day in NYC, I found myself waiting in a freezing room for two hours for the heater to be fixed. Fed up with waiting, I was shown two dark, grim rooms as possible replacements and decided to stay put (at least the room had three windows). I thought the heater was fixed, but to my surprise, the next night, it was still broken. At midnight, after another unsuccessful ordeal with their ""engineers"" in the room with ladders and drills, my companion and I found ourselves traipsing through the hotel in our pajamas while they finally relocated us to an acceptable room. I understand that hotels have maintenance issues. But I didn't expect the poor attitude and slow response to fixing the heater. When I called to let the customer service manager know of my disappointment, she adopted a nasty attitude. Overall, the place is just the pits. Grungy. When we left, the bellman insisted on ""escorting"" us over to a taxi, who was sitting in plain sight. He demanded a tip from the taxi driver, presumably for getting him a fare. And then he did not even help us get our bags into the taxi. Overall, the place is just smarmy.",thatishowitwas,2008-10-01,122005,2008-10-27,False,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.9,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Rats also stay at the New Yorker” BEWARE! I really enjoyed my short break to New York and was already thinking of returning to the New Yorker Hotel. However, on the last night of our stay, we discovered we had been sharing our room with a RAT! It was an awful experience and my daughter almost became hysterical. I know these things can happen, but it was the laid back attitude of staff that really annoyed me. In fairness, they did give us another room close by and upon MY request, they let us keep the room until we were leaving at 5.30pm instead of vacating at mid-day. However, at no time did anyone come and apologise, check if we were okay, or attempt to give any explanation as to how it had happened. I don't think I could ever stay in that hotel again and I shudder to think exactly where the rat had roamed. I am just so relieved we discovered the source of the unexplained noises at the end of our four night stay, otherwise, our entire holiday would have been ruined. As staff seemed so indifferent to our experience, we have been left wondering - just how common is the rat problem?",Sybella008,2008-10-01,122005,2008-10-26,False,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Very nice!” Just got back from a 5 night stay at The New Yorker from the UK. The hotel is very nice and we would stay there again without hesitation. The location of the hotel is very good but has drawbacks. It is very handy for daytime sightseeing with Macy's, Times Square, Empire State and 5th Ave just a five to ten minute walk away. The neighbourhood is nice and Madison Square Garden is literally just across the street. I would really recommend this hotel for people wanting to go to MSG. We struggled at night time to find any particularly nice places to eat. We usually like a nice Italian somewhere near the hotel after a tiring day but this trip we just couldn't find one. Inexperienced New Yorker travellers that we were, we didn't think to book at any of the nicer places in Greenwich Village etc so were unlucky there too. However, the Stage Door Restaurant, just a short walk down the street in the direction of MSG served us well for a number of nights and was very reasonable. The eating issue was slightly disappointing but after such hectic days we didn't really mind as long as the food was good. The hotel lobby is very nice and seems to be nearing the end of construction work, this was very welcoming. The style of the hotel is inkeeping and traditional to the Art Deco era which was nice. The room was newly renovated and wonderfully decorated. Two comfy double beds and plenty of room for 3 of us to walk around. I was surprised at this after reading reviews on here about the smallness of rooms. They are good sized rooms for New York most definitely and have great views. Ours was the Chrysler Building which is one of my favourite buildings of all. The bathroom wasn't newly decorated and in comparison looked a little dated but everything worked fine. The staff in the hotel itself were wonderful and always curtious and helpful. The Tick Tock Diner is a brilliant little place for breakfast and on some nights it served us well for a quick evening meal too. The staff on the whole were ploite bar this one rude, ignorant man who entered into an argument with one of my party in the middle of the diner. After his rude behaviour throughout the meal, we decided not to pay the tip suggested in the bottom of the bill. He was horrid and resorted to calling my party names as we left the restaurant. We complained to the manager who was sorry but didn't seem surprised. We encountered him doing the same to another party a few days later. This excluded, the Tick Tock was a lovely and typical American diner which served good food. The New Yorker is perfect for sightseeing and is newly decorated to make it superior to other cheaper hotels in the area.

"“Bad experience - never again!!” We have stayed at this hotel on the night of Oct. 9th - 2 rooms 2 couples.
The staff at the front-desk was very rude and impolite to us. Especially Tony (eve. shift at 4:00 pm) and one of the girls who sent me to do my laundry on the 9th Ave. while there is a coin laundry in the hotel (which I have found out only the next morning while checking out).
Tony spoke in a tone which made us feel we are not welcome at all, he said it was our fault when upon check in he asked us whether we wish the rooms to be together and we answered - yes. Then he said the rooms were not ready and made us wait without telling us that they do have rooms ready but not together. After one of us made a scene, he refused to talk to the men at all.
Whenever we turned our back - we felt that the staff are talking behind our back. There was no smile of welcome from the moment we have approached the front desk.
I have worked in the hotel industry for many years and have traveled quite a bit but I can't remember a worse experience anywhere that will compare to this.
We will never stay at this hotel again!

"“Good hotel in an excellent location” We stayed at the New Yorker for 4 nights in February.
My Mum and I booked our stay at the New Yorker using Airmiles, so we did not contact the hotel directly. However, when we arrived, they had booked us into a double room rather than a twin room, as we had requested. They weren't overly sorry or helpful - we were told that the only room available was a double on a smoking floor. We had a look but it was very smoky. Eventually they found us a non-smoking double room, which was very nice. We had a bathroom each, the room was very large and it was all very clean. It was very cold in New York, so we had the heating on at night, however it did make very loud noises, so I would recommend bringing ear plugs!
The location of this hotel is great - within easy walking distance of the Empire State building and very close to a number of subway stations.
The hotel doesn't have its own restaurant but is above a diner - the Tick Tock diner, where we ate our breakfast each morning. This was a very convenient and fun place for breakfast with a huge menu and friendly staff.

There were good quality beds, both were more than large enough for one person (≈ 1,50 m), although my parents, only had one bed of the same type for the both of them, which is of course a bit cramped.

"“New Yoker Hotel - recent review” We were not sure what to expect having read many mixed reviews on the New Yorker Hotel but we were delighted with our room on the 19th floot. Spacious with two double beds and an en suite at either end of the room. The TV was excellant and easy to use. The room was clean with a daily maid service.
The elevators were plentifull with 5 serving the first 20 floors. They were speedy and reliable - just 19 seconds from the lobby to the 19th.
Location is fantastic. Just a short to walk to Macy's and Daffy's. Madison Square garden is very close with the Empire state buliding only another 5 min stroll.Times square is also wthin easy walking distance.
The Tick Tock diner annexed to the hotel is busy especially in the mornings and we had to queue once to get in but the service is quick but not always polite.Food quality was ok but more expensive than expected.The Coopers Tavern annexed on the other side is more up market with very good food but again not that cheap. The beer was expensive at 8 dollars a glass.
Hotel staff were all polite and professional and willing to help in any way.

"“Great time at the New Yorker” We stayed at the New Yorker for two nights this past weekend. The location of this hotel can't be beat. It is a 5 minute walk to Macy's, 15 minute walk to Broadway/Times Square and the Penn Station/34th street subway stop is right around the corner.
The room was a little small, but that should be expected in NYC. There were 3 women in our room and though it was a little snug, it was nicely decorated, the beds were comfy and the location, as said before, was excellent. The information/transportation desk was great, showing us how to navigate the subways and even booked a car for us to travel back to the airport. They also printed our boarding passes for our flight which saves time at the airport. The Tick Tock Diner, which can be accessed from the lobby is a great stop for a cheaper breakfast before a full day of sightseeing.
Enjoy NYC, but expect to walk a lot or take the subway to farther destinations. Chinatown is interesting and is great for some bargain shopping, especially knock-off purses!

"“Good base for exploring NYC” I stayed at this hotel from 25th Sep - 1st October with a friend. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews but was pleasently suprised when we arrived. We checked in at 12.30pm with no problems, the room on the 26th floor was clean (although a little small, two women and our clothes AND make up fitted in comfortably!). The bathroom was a decent size and the shower was really powerful with plenty of hot water. Not much of a view out of our window but hey, why stay in the hotel and look out the window?!
Security was very good, guards check you have a room key before letting you through to the elevators, the reception staff and information desk where very helpful when we asked them about dinner reservations, theatre etc etc. Make sure to use the safety deposit boxes - no charge (unless you lose the key then its $200) and be aware they will want some form of ID and a credit card upon check in for incidental charges. We had no problems with any of this and overall the stay was very pleasant. 
Excellent location, 10 minutes walk to Macys, 10 minutes walk to ESB, 15 minute walk to times square, Madison Square Gardens right across the street and excellent transport links with the subway right next door - which is a bargain $2 for any journey - we used it to get down to the WTC site and it only took about 10 minutes!
My partner joined me and my friend for 3 nights of the trip and his room was even better than ours - bigger, better views out of two windows although he was greeted by a rather large cockroach - housekeeping got rid of it and we didnt see any others.
There is ongoing construction in the lobby but honestly, this had no impact on our stay whatsoever and the location and other features of the hotel more than made up for it. 
I have a friend who is staying at this hotel next week for 5 nights and I would definitely stay here again as it is an excellent base for exploring NYC.",x_emma_x_s_x,2008-09-01,122005,2008-10-06,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Don't go with high expectations” I stayed two weeks in the hotel for a business trip. The check in was fairly easy, the lobby is now under construction but still went rather smoothly. This was my second stay in the hotel, this time the room was a bit larger than the last one.
Problems with the hotel: Problematic wireless internet during stay, hot water is almost nonexistant - watch it when taking a shower. Hot one minute, followed by ice water, followed by just right - repeat. Coin Laundry downstairs from the lobby according to the signs, and the first security guard that let me in when my card wouldn't work. Tried to do another load a few nights later to find that the laundry is for students only - the hotel is part of the Educations Housing Services it turns out, and the laundry that is publicly listed is not for hotel guest. Very frustrating to find out that the laundromat is around the corner on 9th ave and 35th street at 8:15pm (last load time there). Thankfully the Chinese people that run it were very friendly and allowed me to do my laundry. Almost non-existent amenities at this location are frustrating during an extended stay. The bathroom was very small, with the toilet literally 5"" from the wall, and the door would open to where you would stand at the sink. Television was problematic as well, as it would make static noises and pixelate randomly.
Great things about the hotel: The room I was in (2655) was very spacious, except for the bathroom. Very good size for one or two people for the extended stay. Penn station is nearby, as well as subway lines. Easy walk to the Empire State Building and shopping areas.
I would not recommend this hotel if you have to pay for it. Company paid trips make it bearable though. Definitely would not suggest this hotel to friends, due to the price and lack of amenities.",EWilly,2008-09-01,122005,2008-10-02,False,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Central Location Yet Can't Hear the Noise” I stayed in this hotel earlier this week for 3 nights and I was pleasantly surprised. I travelled solo so as a young female one of my concerns is always safety and for starters, this was not something that was ever an issue here. As other reviews have mentioned, there is always someone before you get to the elevator to check your room key. No key, no room access. 
Yes there was construction still going on (visible in the lobby) but the hotel was always full of people coming or going (many young people) and I felt a great welcoming atmosphere from the moment I checked in. Speaking of checking in, I was ecstatic when I got to the hotel at 9:30am and they had a room already available for me. 
My room was on the 31st floor and I could not hear any street noise (as was the case when I stayed in NYC during my last visit) although the noise of a constant fan in the room did get a bit annoying when trying to fall asleep.
The size of the room was small but it worked for me. Maybe if there were 2+ people sharing it, I could see it getting a bit tight. The bathroom was average size and as other read reviews state, there was an issue with the water - not a lot of pressure and either hot or cold - no in between. Again, I didn't mind this - I was only there for 3 nights and as long as I could shower, I was happy. 
There was a good selection of movies, music to choose from if someone wanted to stay in and watch some television. I chose to listen to the clock radio every morning when I was getting ready to leave. There was a desk, a dresser and of course a closet equipped with the standard iron & ironing board. 
I would definately stay here again, mainly b/c of the location. Right on the subway lines and within walking distance to many of the major shops and attractions. I loved that there was a Starbucks right across the street and the adjoining 24hr diner was very convenient when I didn't want to travel far to get a filling yet cheap breakfast.",ladymarielle,2008-09-01,122005,2008-10-02,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Wonderful Honeymoon!!! Great central location!” The staff at check-in gave us an upgraded room since it was our honeymoon. They gave us a corner room on the 25th floor. The room was beautiful and the bed was extremely comfortable. We did so much sightseeing that our legs and feet hurt badly at the end of the day, but it was well worth it. We packed a lot into our 5 days there. The location of the hotel was perfect - right across from a subway station. We finally figured out the subway the last couple of days we were there so next time it will be much easier. Also, don't believe what you hear about New Yorkers or see on TV - they were extremely nice and helpful to tourists. The Big Apple gets a definite A+!!!

"“Great Location!” I stayed at this hotel for 4 days with my husband. Our room was on the 24th floor and we were lucky to see a small view of the empire state building.
The room was great no problems, was kept clean daily. Though on our last day we were visited by a huge cockroach, we were happy as we were on our way out of the door so it didn't bother us too much. The hotel staff were friendly and we had no problems with them until on the day to check out. The guy at the reception desk took our keys and said thats it you all done. We knew we had a bill to settle etc so we returned again to reception and was told we haven't checked out, so it turned out the guy didn't check us out properly, he only took our keys. Anyway another reception staff checked us out properly.
The tick tock dinner next door is no good my husband got food poison from there, go to the dinner next to lowes cinema just across the road from tick tock dinner by the subway entrance, there food is much better.
The location of the hotel is great, we walked everywhere so no point getting a taxi, bus or using the subway.

"“Enjoyed my stay at the New Yorker” I stayed at the New Yorker for four days and ti be honest didn't know what to expect but I was pleasently suprised with the New Yorker
The hotel staff on arrival were more than pleasant and my room up on the 20th floor (2065 to be exact) was satisfactory, though the first night I arrived was at the end of a tropical storm and I needed the air con, this was a bit on the noisy side and had to be turned off before I could sleep, the bed was very comfortable, the room and bathroom clean and I felt secure
The view from my room was of a wall, another section of the hotel, and the light didn't exactly pour in, but I didn't go to New York stop in the hotel all day
The location of the New Yorker was better than I thought, it is situated just across from Penn Station, Madison Sq Garden and down the street from Macy's and the Empire State, it is in walking distance (I can walk it) from Time Square
There is no restaurant in the hotel, but this is more than made up for by breakfast and endless cups of free coffee at the 'Tick Tock' diner through the connecting door from reception

I use hotels as a base, somewhere clean, where I can leave luggage safely and feel comfortable in, The New Yorker fitted the bill and I have no complaints",12thDomino,2008-09-01,122005,2008-09-26,False,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Cash stolen from room and no action taken” We stayed in the New Yorker for a week. The hotel was fine, if a bit basic, but the rooms were a good size for new york. 
The rooms however do not have safes and on our last day we discovered that $120 which we had put to one side in the bottom of our suitcase in the closet had been taken along with an empty travellers cheques wallet. We reported it and was sent to three different people - none of whom explained what would be done and what action would be taken. We were told to come back at 3.00pm (we were leaving at 3.30pm) as process would take 30 minutes. We came back and spoke to the security desk and they started to take our details again. Nothing had been done and no details had been logged. We again spoke to three people, the final person being the customer relations manager who was useless and said that he has to deal with this very often and people always suspect the staff. Our issue was that no one could tell us the process for logging this issue or what would be done. The final straw was when the customer relation manager said ""you've signed your statement about the loss haven't you"" - we were not even told to do this - the person who had logged our complaint put it on a scrap of paper. 
The hotel is average however the process for dealing with customer complaints is awful.",Richard2020,2008-09-01,122005,2008-09-14,False,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.7,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Loved The New Yorker” My girlfriend and I stayed at the New Yorker in August and absolutely loved it. I had requested a room on a high floor in advance and was pleased that they had allocated us a room on the 37th floor with amazing views over Manhattan and the Hudson river and all this for the price of a standard room!!!
Like many other reviewers we loved the Art Deco architecture of the New Yorker and the redecorated room was very original and true to the Art Deco style. The room was small but still comfortable and made good use of the space. The redcoration of the lobby was finished during our stay and now looks great especially the big chandellier. We had breakfast twice in the Tic Toc Diner which was very good and at a good price. 
As a frequent traveller who stayes in hotels about 100 nights a year I must say that the New Yorker stands out among many bland chain hotels I have stayed in and would not heistate to recomend the hotel.",Rolfbusk,2008-08-01,122005,2008-09-13,False,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Good location - crap staff” Fabulous location as previously stated and the renovations are coming along nicely, stayed in a renovated room and it was clean, tidy and sufficient for our one night stay. However the Ramada seems to have upgraded its rooms and downgraded its customer service, the receptionist who checked us in was down-right rude and even asked us if we understood english (we're British) and when taking payment for the room managed to make an error and 'maxed out' our card. This fact didnt seem to concern her in the slightest and informed us, as it was there mistake they would sort it out but it would be 7 working days before we saw the funds returned - now with another week's holiday ahead of us this did not go down so well, as it was the majority of the spending money.
Tried to complain to the management but they just weren't interested - they had their payment (and then some) what did they care.
The next day we booked a town car through the travel desk at the New Yorker, who had organised a fleet of cars to take us and other passengers to the Queen Mary 2 for the next part of our holiday, the trip should have taken 30 mins and was a fully inclusive rate of $65 inc tips and toll - 3hrs later the driver managed to get us the dock having taken us to Queens, JFK airport, La Guardia Airport, downtown, and finally to Brooklyn, although we did have to stop 5 times to ask for directions as their driver had no clue as to where he was going and spoke little English, although this didnt stop him asking for another $20 dollars and toll money when we finally reached our destination. Word of advice if booking travel through New Yorker - make sure you ask for a driver who knows English!!
Overall these 2 experiences have put us off staying at the New Yorker ever again and we have been regular customers of theirs for the last 3 years. Now we simply will take our custom elsewhere.",NYCGirlYork,2008-09-01,122005,2008-09-11,False,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.4,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Small but impeccably kept room, great location...” My wife and I stayed in room 3303 ('Metro Room - 1 Queen') for four nights in the middle of our honeymoon. The New Yorker is still undergoing renovation and the reception wasn't finished but our room and everything else on our floor was.
The room was tiny, there was barely enough room to put two suitcases down, but then this is New York. Everything worked. the air con was good, there was a flat screen TV on the wall (which wasn't straight!) and it was as clean as anywhere else I've been.
There is a launderette in the basement but don't rely on it! There were 10 washing machines, 8 worked. There were 5 dryers, 1 worked! There was one laudry powder machine and it didn't work!
The diner downstairs (the tick tock) is excellent, especially for breakfast, and the location of this hotel is spot on: the subway entrance is on the side of the building and Penn Station is the next block along.

For the cost of this holiday I cannot complain at the price I paid and enjoyed a wonderful 3 nights in New York.

"“Artchitecture is important to me” Since I am an artist, I really love the Art Deco style that the hotel has preserved. Architecture is important to me in a hotel stay, too. Not just room size or amenities. 
This hotel has some really ornate art and architectural designs in the rooms as well as common areas. Plus the hotel has a lot of fascinating New York history to go along with it (e.g., Muhammad ali stayed there after his famous fight with Joe Frazier.)
The rooms quaint and cozy; a little on the small side but they're renovating a lot of the rooms to make them larger. 
I'd stay there again.

"“Good hotel” Stayed for a week in August with my husband for our wedding anniversary. 
Hotel - Hotel bedrooms have undergone renovation and are very clean and updated. We stayed on the 29th floor, in a corner room, which compared to reviews of other rooms, seems to have more space as we did not find it small at all. (Maybe worth asking for a corner room when you book - also means you get 2 sides of windows/views). View of river was good. Maid cleaned the room and replaced towels daily - room was always very clean. No coffee/tea facilities in room - however 10 mins after we checked in reception called to ask if we would like a coffee machine delivered to the room free of charge - which we got another 10 mins later! They gave us a couple of packets of coffee/milks which lasted a couple of days. We found the staff fairly friendly and helpful. Hotel does not have that many facilities but then you would not use much when staying in New York!
Eating - Tick Tock diner is next door which is ok, there is another cafe/restaurant when you come out of the hotel and turn right, straight across the road (next to Irish place). Of course, there are tons of cafes/Starbucks etc around anyway. The restaurant next to the hotel did very good food and fairly reasonably priced. The Irish place also does nice food. We did not find many other great restaurants around the area - think you would have to know where to go and probably out of this area to get a really good meal. 
Travel - subway is right next door to hotel. Can walk to a lot of things from hotel - including Grand Central Station which is about 25 mins walk away past Bryant Park. Penn station is across the road also. Would recommend using the subway which is $2 a journey rather than being ripped off by yellow cabs! You can also get discounts on buying lots of tickets on the subway. 
Attractions - as mentioned, a lot is nearby. Would recommend Top of the Rock (Rockefeller building) rather than Empire State as queues much shorter and view just as good. Broadway is up the road - can book tickets on ticketmaster or we just went to the theatre and bought them direct and chose our seats. WE used Gray Line bus company and bught a 3 day bus tour ticket where you can hop on/off the various tours they do. The price included a boat cruise which was good. Would recommend going out of the immediate area to see things e.g. Central Park, South Street Seaport etc etc. 
Overall - a good experience at this hotel and would stay again.",Visitortonewyork87,2008-08-01,122005,2008-09-03,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Excellent Location” We have just got back from a family holiday in NY and can safely say what a great hotel the New Yorker was. The location was ideal - a miniute's walk from the metro, 5 mins to Empire State Building. 
Staff were OK, they didnt seem to be in a rush to do anything or be overly helpful but I suppose you should accept that in NY
We went with our 2 children (4 & 1) and experienced no problems - make sure you request a double room with 2 beds though. The kids loved having a McDonalds opposite.
We had breakfast at the diner next door and what was very good - typical breakfast was 2 eggs, toast and hash browns for around $6.
The room had a desk as well as a plasma tv !

"“Nice hotel, Good location” We booked this trip through expedia, and having been to New York before i know that you dont get much for your money.
This place was on offer and cost just over £100.00 a night for a double room.
The room was small, i mean no more than a foot round the bed of free space. But is was Very Clean and pleasent. The bathroom was tiny but again clean.
Air conditioning was a window rattler unit, but it did drown out the noise of the police sirens...
but my grandma had a disabled acess room, which was fantatsic, lots of room, lovely big bathroom, Sofa and seating area.
And the bonus....A fantastic view of the skyline....
The Lobby seems very open and you walk in to the diner or the bar, but to access the lifts you have to show your room key, so you feel secure.
All the rooms are on the 21st Floor and above. 
If like us you are a group, we booked 3 rooms all on the same booking . We were on the 23rd floor, My parents on the 26th and my grandma on the 31st!!!!. I would of though disabled room would be the lowest floor in case of an emergency, but what do i know about hotel designs.
Location:-
We arrived in New york at penn station which is diagonally opposite this hotel, so we walked over to it took no more than 5 minutes even with all our luggage and the wheelchair.
1 block from here is macy and all the shops.
Opposite the hotel is a 24hr mc donalds , TGI fridays and a 24hr drug store/ supermarket.
Really nice irish bar (exit hotel and turn right) about 1 block down, first one you come too. Great food, pleasent staff, reasonable prices.
Due to the wheelchair we mainly got cabs to the attractions, from the hotel down to battery park in monday morning rush hour only cost us $17 dollars.

No coffee/tea making facilities but coffee available in lobby. Reception staff generally pleasant but not especially smiley or fast. Hotel 5 minutes on foot from Macy's, 10-15 minutes from Empire State Building, 10-15 minutes from Times Square. Very good access to Penn Station (for train to Newark Airport) and subway.

"“Small room, clean, perfect location.” Stayed at the New Yorker on a business trip (booked it because it was just next door to our meeting place). But I must say it also seems like a truly excellent location for any tourist visiting Manhattan, so I figured I'd mention it here. 
The hotel itself is average, but the location is just perfect: very easy access to all major attractions, lots of excellent restaurants, diners, bars. You can just walk everywhere any time of day or night. This is indeed a very safe area - not something that you can take for granted everywhere in New York. 
The room was small, and clearly was not one of the newly remodeled units: all the plumbing looked like it was a hundred years old. But everything would run just fine, no complaints there. It was actually interesting to see this part of history intact. I've seen some vintage plumbing in European hotels before, but never here in the US. The room was clean, AC unit worked just fine, didn't give me any problems. Nice view from the window. 
Not sure how comfortable I'd be in a room of that size if it was the two of us traveling with lots of luggage. But it was definitely comfortable enough for me and my carry-on.
Like I said, it's an average hotel with small rooms (well, this is New York!) and the perfect location.",Traveler0987654321,2008-08-01,122005,2008-08-14,False,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“6.5 out of 10” As a Travel Consultant I have stayed in many New York hotels during visits over the last 10 years. So decided to give the New Yorker ""a go"" for the 4 nights the 4 of us were there.
Keep in mind this is before the refurbishment of rooms so I will not mention the condition of rooms in this review. 
The location was great. We ate at the diner once and the experience & food was fine. The security was fantastic which is a good thing in New York. The rooms are small but as has been mentioned by others you get what you pay for. 99% of the staff were friendly and attentive. The rooms were clean.
Room 1: First night the wind was blowing a gale and there was a terrible noise coming the AC unit. On inspection the whole unit was missing and there was a hole in the wall covered by the Uunits plastic cover. Contacted front desk, no offer to move us and said they could not do anything about it. So for 4 nights we had howling wind coming through the hole in the wall.
Room 2: Apart from the clanging of the flagpole ropes outside the window all night it was OK.
Hot water was good and bathroom sufficient for 2 people.
If the rooms have been refurbished by now the New Yorker would be a good place to stay as a middle of the road Hotel but really it is the location that is the outstanding feature for travellers.
My only suggestion is that the front desk staff be more reactive to problems that are brought to their attention.",ozitraveler,2007-03-01,122005,2008-08-06,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Excellent Stay!!” I was a little hesistant booking this hotel as it was under-going renovations, however upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised at the overall appearance of the hotel as well as our room.
The hotel accommodated us very well. We had a Plaza Suite- which was two double beds and a pull-out sofa with two full bathrooms (this was a huge plus considering there were 5 girls staying in one room)! The room was renovated and decent size for New York. The window unit AC's proved to be very cooling--- as sometimes our rooms were very cold--but no complaints here! Even tho they were window units, noise was not an issue in any way. The elevators were pretty quick and security was great with checking cards. Front desk service was very nice and they even helped us with getting a car service back to the airport.
Location is definitely a huge plus- with great access to Madison Square Garden, Times Square, Empire State Building, as well as subway routes. 
Would definitely stay here again when in New York!!",nikole005,2008-07-01,122005,2008-08-04,False,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“The New Yorker Hotel Experience” After reading many negative reviews of the hotel, my husband and I took the chance and booked for a week stay in this hotel..
I took a lot of pictures of this hotel, our room and of Manhattan.
All the rooms are newly renovated, no more stinky carpets, and dirty paints and curtains as posted in old reviews. All are sparkling new (we were allowed to see other rooms for review). We stayed in the 25th floor. The room was small BUT very nice. The room we had is good for 2 people, very quiet, the AC was not noisy at all unlike one review (due to the renovations). We could not hear any pounding or men at work, or the busy streets down below at all. And I am very sensitive with noise (I wake up easily when I hear footsteps several feet away). 
We had a nice view of the Hudson river, watching the sunset is a treat for me and my camera. The towels and sheets were changed everyday. I had a great time exploring New York City after a good night's sleep in this hotel.
Location-wise, it is very close to Macy's, Duane Reade, McDonalds (open 24 hours), a subway station we did not try, taxis are everywhere (cheap rate we were surprised)...
And a few blocks from the hotel is the Empire State Building.. we love walking! 
The hotel staff and receptionists are very nice and courteous. The security manager even allowed me to take lots of pictures of the hotel. We felt very safe there, and we saw a lot of people checking in on the weeekend. My husband and I were expecting worse, to be honest. But we were very satisfied with our stay there. I loved their bed too. The bathroom is a bit small but hey, it's New York.
As for amenities, we did not try out the gym but my husband did go to the laundry room (we ended up going outside for dry cleaning). My husband did not like the washing machines, only half of the machines worked, he said. 
We used the flat iron and the ironing board, which are tucked away in a small closet. The closet is a bit small if you have lots of clothes and bulky luggages. My husband and I had 2 carry-ons (about 22 x 12 x 13"", the standard size for Delta airline luggage), and two personal items-I had my camera bag, tripods and my husband had his backpack.
There is a vending machine near our room, so we had steady supply of ice for free, and the diet pepsi costed a dollar which isn't much for us.
We did not eat in the in-house restaurant because we wanted to explore other food and dining.
All in all, we would recommend this hotel for people wanting to get a lower price and a great stay.. If you are looking for a bigger space and room, be ready to spend more money. You get what you pay for.",pnr_mbr2006,2008-07-01,122005,2008-08-01,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Great upgrades and location” We booked the New Yorker for a long weekend stay in late July. We were concerned about the rooms, as the hotel was in the process of renovating when we booked, but was complete by the time of our stay. Our room, on the 29th floor with two double beds, was roomy by New York standards, and cheap at $239 a night. The renovations are well done, while preserving some of the historic character of the building. The business center was nice and well-maintained. Staff were friendly and helpful. The location is great at 34th and 8th, one block from Macy's, two blocks from Herald Square and three blocks from the Empire State Building. It is also a 10-minute walk to Times Square and the Subway location at Herald Square is very convenient.",4-the-road,2008-07-01,122005,2008-07-30,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Hotel room was small but we were never there so it didn't bother us at all, main thing was that is was clean and the TV was huge!
Only down side was the cost of calls from our room - rip off, do not pick it up!
Good thing was that if the staff near the lifts didn't recognise you, you had to show your room key to gain access - very comforting security.
Diner was nice, large choice. The restaurant didn't have much on the menu and was a bit pricy.

It was very clean, the people were very nice and I like it that they have you show your key card to get up to the rooms or down to the workout area. I feel better knowing people can't just wander the hallways if they aren't staying there.

Very good security ...show your room card to get an elevator.
The room was just fine and recently remodeled. 
All staff were excellent.
It was a short walk to Macy's and quick cab access to Broadway shows ...about $7 including the tip.
We were short on departure time so we did not try Penn station access to Newark International Airport but it should be a snap (a Towncar is $75 and a cab is about $50).",gonepackin,2008-07-01,122005,2008-07-16,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.9,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Average bathroom, cheap rate” Overall, it's an OK hotel. The room was nice, if a little small, and the television was massive. The problem was the bathroom - it looked as if it had not been updated in 20 years! The shower was not great. 
The foyer was also a bit shabby, and the reception staff were not that helpful. 
We tried to organise a transfer to the airport (early morning flight) and I'm sure the security guard just called one of his relatives, as he came in an unmarked car, instead of a proper taxi service, like we had asked for. He charged the same amount as the taxi service so we weren't too bothered.

It was a terrible experience. There was construction going on all over the hotel and the lobby was worse than a train station with hordes of gawking tourists sitting around at all times. They even had two staffers checking room keys before letting you take the elevator. 
The hotel had musty, faded carpets and the room was small and desperately needed an upgrade.

"“A bit updated since last” We visited the Ramada New Yorker for our 7th time in 3 years and this time we were given a renovated room on the 23rd Floor. Dont be fooled by the size of the room, my disappointment was a Queen room..you'd think Queen bed...when we got there it was a full-size bed...the room is the queen, not the bed. They no longer have smoking rooms which wasnt mentioned when booked so each time we went to smoke it was 23 flights down to the outside. Not bad, just gave us an excuse to walk around some more each time we went for one! Of course, I will always say I like the Ramada New Yorker because of the location to the subways and eateries. Its a great place. No receipt on the way out this time (which could be a problem when they take your card info at check-in), they said we'd get it from Expedia...I know that isnt true because Expedia didnt give me one the last time, the New Yorker did. Ah well. Other than that, not bad. The rooms did get pricier since they remodeled a bit, but I wouldnt say totally renovated. The tile in the bathroom and the doors are all the same. They changed the decor really, rooms are no bigger. Prices doubled from $159 a night to nearly $260 a nite now. Still, a great place to stay solely due to the location and the convenience to everything in the vicinity.

"“Very nice budget hotel, perfect location” I made a spur of the moment trip to NYC and needed a hotel fast...found great rates at the New Yorker Hotel. It's about a block from Madison Square Garden/Penn Station. The first thing I noticed was that it was clean, well kept and well secured by all-night guards...nice when you are traveling alone. I came in very late, and was kindly received at the front desk and upgraded to a renovated room (I didn't see the unrenovated rooms, so I can't comment). It was small but comfortable. Bathroom fixtures were all new, and the bedroom furniture was new. There was a window air conditioning unit which was pretty loud, but I got used to it. It worked fine. The bedding was very comfortable and higher quality. It was extremely quiet in my room except for my A/C unit. I was extremely pleased with the stay. Knowing that New York hotels are unbelievably expensive, this was a great option at under $200 a night. The location was fantastic.

"“ideal location” We have just returned from our second trip to the New Yorker Hotel, and still couldn't fault it. The first time we went they were renovating although this didn't impact on our holiday. The rooms were basic but clean and comfortable. This year the rooms were much nicer and not that much more expensive, the staff were nice although they can be a bit miserable at times. Overall this hotel was in a fantastic location and very good value for money. This hotel is only one block from Macys and the Empire State Building, and 5 minutes from Times Square. The Tick Tock diner is nice for breakfast but can work out expensive if you eat there all the time, and it is terrible for a main meal so avoid at night. We found a nice diner next to Lowes cinema across the street called Andrews diner. The staff here were really friendly and the food was just as nice as the Tick Tock but half the price. We would advise against getting the phone cards from the hotel as you can only use them in your room, and although you have already paid for it the hotel charges you $1 every time you use the phone. I have recommended this hotel to other people and would definatley recommend it to anyone that wants a great hotel on a budget. We would definatley go back.

"“Good place to stay” The New Yorker is well located for mid-town Manhattan, and close to Penn Station and the subway. There is an abundance of local shops and eateries, and a cinema around the corner.
A short walk away are sights such as Macy's, the Empire State Building and 5th Avenue.
I found the hotel clean and well staffed. The hotel security was reassuring and prevents people from entering the lifts without a room card.
The onsite 24 hour diner was very convenient, although I recommend exploring the many other eateries nearby.
I had a rennovated Queen room on the 27th floor. It was small, but clean and functional. I was disappointed with the bathroom refurbishment and the lack of tea/coffee making facilities.
As an overall impression this hotel is very convenient, but in New York you get what you pay for, so don't expect 5 star luxury.

"“Love this hotel!!!” LOVE THIS HOTEL!! We stayed here on business, after I'd stayed here a couple months ago for the first time. The hotel is a GREAT location, and the front desk staff is wonderful. I had requested a particular room because I'd previously stayed in the room w/my husband, and the hotel honored my request. If we had any questions, they were very friendly and happy to help.
The hotel room is extremely clean, and a little small, but that is to be expected in NY City. I had a fantastic view of the Empire State Building, which is well within walking distance from the hotel. Times Square is also within walking distance. If you don't care to do the walking, the subway station is literally right around the corner. 
This hotel is and always will be the first hotel I check when I am visiting NY. I recently stayed in NY, and the hotel was sold out. The other hotel I stayed in significantly paled by comparison.

"“Tower of Filth” The only nice thing about the New Yorker was the hotel lobby. Once you get past the glamorous lobby it pretty much turns into a run down motel. I rented a suite, for about $200 a night, the room was a pretty big size. Unfortunately, the size had no relation to the quality of the room. The sheets were clean, but the comforter was old and had holes in it. The carpet had about 5 to 6 decent sized stains along with a couple iron burns. The room came with 2 couches, both had red stains on them.

"“good location, not too clean” I stayed at the New Yorker for a couple of nights. The overall experience was not too bad but only because of the location of the hotel.

"“Beautifully redone and superbly clean” My school (I'm a teacher) booked this room because it's close to the Convention Center and I just went. I am a former Manhattanite and knew the location was good, but knew absolutely nothing about the hotel except for its recognizable exterior. It dates to the Art Deco era and is presently under renovation. I shared a room with a fellow teacher and it was superbly clean and obviously newly renovated. The carpet still smelled new. The two queen sized beds were more comfortable than any hotel beds I've ever slept in. The attached 24 hour restaurant ( coffee house type) had excellent breakfasts reasonably priced for New York. If you are in a newly refurbished room and away from construction noise, this is a great bargain for New York. The room was a good size and had windows on two sides--something you rarely find in newer hotels in New York. The bathroom was tiny but newly done and clean. The only drawback was the small pedestal sink with very little space (well' practically none!) for toiletries. But since I know the size of apartments people live in in New York, this was not unusual! The room was bigger than many studio apartments in the city, and the bathroom size comparable to the one in my own Manhattan studio apartment. 
I would recommend this for a stay at a reasonable price with a great location in mid-town. Just be sure to ask for a room that's newly done and is away from construction noise.

"“Quite dirty for the price” I needed to stay at this hotel for a conference. It was the kind of place where you didn't want to touch anything because of the filth. The carpet felt greasy. The bed sheets had holes in them. The bathroom surfaces were sticky. I know they are going through some renovation and I can understand if the carpet or drape styles are out of date, but the sheets need to be clean and not full of holes. 
Another pet peeve: when the television is turned on, it always defaults to the hotel channel that set to be extremely loud. I could hear it being turned on in all the rooms around me, all hours of the night. Not very good for sleep.

"“Midwestern Girl Stayed at The New Yorker” Just got back from the New Yorker Hotel. I'm a Midwestern girl who'd never been to the City that Never Sleeps before this trip. I traveled with my friend, who was celebrating her 40th birthday.
Price: $269 for Thursday night and Sunday night / $299 for Friday/Saturday night (10/04/07-10/08/07) for a suite (bedroom and separate living room, one queen sized bed, mini fridge, no coffee maker)
Positives: Excellent location. Convenient to EVERYTHING. Allowed early check-in (our room was ready four hrs early). Our en suite had a gorgeous view of the NY skyline (26th floor), with a lovely stone patio (I called the hotel a few days prior to our arrival and spoke with a very nice man who promised me he'd give us a room with a view) . Clean linens, extra pillows, prompt cleaning personnel. Doormen were attentive and very nice. Attached restaurant (Tick Tock) was delicious, with average NY prices (example: eggs, ham and pancake: about $8). Gift shop downstairs had reasonably priced merchandise, $4 for an ""I ♥ NY"" t-shirt (can get same shirt for $2 from a street vendor or $9.99 at the airport). Good security, I always felt safe. 
Negatives: In the middle of a remodel, so expect worn/stained carpet, scary hallways with bad paint and absolutely no decorating attempts at all, and occasional construction noise. Rooms need updated paint, thorough top-to-bottom cleaning and windows cleaned. Our lovely patio had a glass patio door that was permanently locked for ""security reasons"" so we couldn't step outside (extremely disappointing!). Front desk (female) staff were sloppily dressed with stained shirts, and appeared bored with their jobs. Ignore them. 
Final note: I would definitely stay here again, but not pay the surcharge for an en suite room since the extra space wasn't necessary for us considering the amount of time we spent in the room (not much!). Good value for the money though. Ask for a room with a view, you may just get it. You'll love the location and find yourself walking to everything (weather permitting) because you can.

"“Superb hotel - probably better when it's finished!” We stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon at it is a pretty reasonable hotel in a very good location of new york. Couple of blocks away from the empire states building.
The hotel was getting a complete overall when we were there so it's difficult to say what this will be like when it's finished - or if the price is so reasonable - originally we were given a double room on the 26th floor but the noise from the construction was pretty horendus! There were people staying on this floor too so if you do book make sure you know what floor they're refurbishing at the time - We were transfered though up to a suite which was really nice and far away from the noise. The staff were really really nice about this - and I don't think this was solely to do with our honeymoon either. 
If you're getting the plane into Newark then take the shuttle train to Pennsilvania station from the airport. Works out way cheaper - pennsilvania station is very walkable - about 2 blocks from what I can remember and the $30 odd for two tickets on the train is way cheaper than the cost of a taxi. 
Some of this review sounds a bit negative with the reburbishment and all but as long as you request a floor where it's not happening you wouldn't even know it was on. It;s a great hotel in a great location (and great city!) so would thouroughly recommend it.

"“Nasty” I have stayed in NY many times at various hotels. In my opinion, this is expensive, for what you get, even in New York. They are updating this hotel, so maybe in by 2008 it will be different, but right now expect dirty, two star hotel. It is decently located.

"“Shabby!” The New Yorker was to put it simply, a shabby experience. From the outside signs with paint peeling to the interior old and grubby carpets. The lobby was impressive with beautiful decor, if you ignore the carpets and slightly dated chairs. 
The reception staff were too busy to be friendly, but were helpful...cleaning crew were always polite and friendly, as was the doorman. Rooms were always cleaned to a high standard, but no Tea/coffee facilities was inconvenient at best. Room was tiny with a view of opposite building and very very noisy! Heating system made terrible racket and air con system (at 28 floors up), let in all the street noise.
Luggage storage upon departing should be avoided as it seems to be a chaotic and tedious process.
This cost 1398 euro for 4 nights.
Location was great , quick walk to most places, broadway, macys and circle line tours.
Would I stay again? No. Would like to recommend for someone looking for a good location and not looking for luxury, but really, at those prices it wouldnt be my first choice.

"“disgusting!” I went to New York City for the first time last april. When we first arrived from Boston on the train we arrived and the hotel looked great from the outside, but as we checked in and were taken into the room we were incredibly disappointed. Our room was very unclean, and some broken glass was in the bathroom, there were exposed cracks and chipped paint all over the walls. There were also many stains on the carpet and the room absolutly REEKED of cigarette smoke, the walls were also very thin, you could hear all the cars outside all night, and there wasn't much of a view.

"“was a nice place to stay” My wife and I stayed for 6 nights in July on the 34th floor. Rooms were small but fine for sleeping. Cleaning crew were fine and come around early so be sure to put out the DND sign if you can find one. Extra towels are a must and tips help you get them. Had rusty looking water twice come out of tap in bathroom so let it runall good before brushing teeth. Great Restaurant in hotel, and elevators are fast with not alot of waiting. Security guards are good and look for room keys almost all the time to gain entry on the elevators. Great view of MSG, and two minutes walk from Penn Station, and MSG.

"“Nice location but....” From the minute we arrived things started to go wrong. The doorman was rude and abrupt, the reception staff were barely better. 
I loved the location, couldn't have been in a better spot, but my daughter and I kept getting electric shocks every time we touched metal in our room. The rooms were small, cramped and grotty and in everywhere but the public areas the carpets were torn, threadbare and faded.
Would recommend for the location but that's all I would recommend it for.

"“Hotel Nightmare” From the moment I arrived with my family, the whole thing went badly. First of all, the Towers at the New Yorker is really just the Ramada. Standing on a busy NY City street with our luggage, we were looking for a sign that said ""Towers"" but found none. It is just the New Yorker. Ramada, New Yorker and Towers is the same place with many names. 
The website described the rooms as: ""a superior family suite includes 2 doubles, 1 twin, marble bathroom with hair dryer and phone. All are beautifully decorated for luxurious comfort. You'll enjoy all the amenities a fine hotel can offer including fax machines wet bar refrigerator coffee maker and a selection of coffees and teas irons and ironing board 2 line phones and data ports."" 
We did not receive a suite with two double beds and a twin bed. We had two double beds.
We did not have panoramic views of the city. Instead, we were able to look at the building across 8th Avenue and watch the garment workers at work through the window.
Our room was not beautifully decorated. The carpets showed major signs of wear and had noticeable soil patterns from foot traffic. The sofa was soiled to the point that my wife called housekeeping to get a sheet to put over the top of it.
The air conditioning consisted of a window type air conditoner sticking out of the window. Being that we were there in February during 20 degree New York nights, this was not my idea of luxury. Besides being drafty, it let in all of the street noise.
Around 10:00pm our first night, a uniformed person from housekeeping opened the door unannounced with a non-unformed person and they were very surprised to see us there. They just left quickly, without indicating why they walked in. I reported this to management and they apologized but made no big deal about it. I wonder if we were still out having dinner how much of our personal belongings would have disappeared.
We arrived back late in the evening on our second night and the room was not made up. Not having your room made-up and having to deal with used towels, full waste baskets and unmade beds is not my idea of luxury. 
There was no coffee maker and no assortment of coffees and teas. Instead, there was a breakfast bar 18 floors up from my room. This was the nice spot of the hotel as it is on the 39th floor and has great views of the city.
The website showed rooms at $179 per night for the two doubles and a twin. I booked it online and had the confirmation. Upon departure, to add insult to injury, they charged me $229 per night for the room with just two doubles, which the manager on duty refused to adjust. I had to dispute the issue with my credit card company and finally got it resolved 4 weeks later.
I travel often with work and stay in 7-8 hotels a year in major US cities. My standards are pretty reasonable and I don't expect perfection and am not a complainer. I do have to say this was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I was not given the room I reserved, was overcharged, had visibly dirty furnishings and did not find the staff anything but average or below. Luckily, we only slept there and had a very enjoyable trip otherwise seeing the sights and catching a Broadway show.",,2005-02-01,122005,2005-04-25,False,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.3,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
“せまいが立地よし” ミッドタウンにあり駅も近いですし、主な観光地へのアクセスは最高です。しかし、便利だということは当然夜中まで騒がしいということでもありますね。ただ、夜遅く出歩いてもだいじょうぶそうなエリアです。部屋はせまく、アメニティなどはほぼありません。（シャンプーくらいかな？歯ブラシなどありません）それと冷蔵庫がないため製氷機から氷をとってきて使いました。建物の外観やフロントは老舗ホテルの風情ですが部屋にはいるといきなりビジネスホテル化する気がします。ニューヨークではこんな形が普通なのかもしれません。あ、それとセキュリティーボックスもありませんでした。ないものを想定して備える必要はあるホテルだと思います。,kazoo77,2012-10-01,122005,2012-12-18,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.9,0,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Ideales Hotel für den nächsten New York City Trip!” Ich habe eine Woche gemeinsam mit meinem Bruder und einer Freundin im New Yorker Hotel übernachtet. Das Hotel zeichnet sich durch seine perfekte Lage in Manhattan aus und liegt wenige Minuten zu Fuß vom Empire State Building, dem Madison Square Garden und dem Times Square entfernt. Die nächste Bahnstation (Pennsylvania Station) befand sich beinahe direkt neben dem Hotel. In unmittelbarer Nähe war praktischerweise ein Supermarkt. 
Das Zimmer war für 3 Personen von der Größe her in Ordnung. Schließlich waren wir nur im Hotel zum Auffrischen oder Schlafen. Über Lärm von der Straße oder aus anderen Zimmern konnten wir uns nicht beklagen. 
Das Badezimmer war von der Ausstattung her alt, aber sauber. Die Zimmer wurden renoviert. 
Mit dem Personal an der Rezeption kam es ab und an zu Missverständnissen. Es wirkte distanziert, letztendlich hat aber alles geklappt. Das Reinigungspersonal, das man ab und an auf dem Flur traf, war jedoch sehr freundlich und ein Lächeln wurde sich gegenseitig geschenkt. 
Leider ist das kostenslose W-Lan im 33. Stockwerk nutzlos. Der Empfang reichte nur in der Lobby, um kurze Nachrichten nach Hause zu schicken oder im Internet nach Infos einzelner Restaurants oder Sehenswürdigkeiten in NYC zu suchen. 
Sehr gut war die direkte Anbindung an das Tick Tock Diner, das neben dem Hotel und gleichzeitig durch die Lobby des Hotels erreichbar war. Hier konnte man gut frühstücken und zu Abend essen.

Me desesperei (era domingo à noite e estava chovendo pacas) e não conseguia pensar para falar em inglês, mas a recepcionista foi perfeita, entendeu meu portunhol, pediu alguns minutinhos e me realocou num quarto melhor(que ficam do 20 andar pra cima), pelo mesmo preço da minha reserva. O quarto era enorme, com vista para o Empire, super confortável. Só o banheiro deixou a desejar, era antigo.
Não tive qlqr contato com os funcionários, achei meio impessoal.

"“Bien placé mais...” Nous avons passé 4 nuits dans cet hôtel plutôt bien situé dans Manhattan (10mn de times square). Un des atouts charmes de cet hôtel est son style art déca plutôt sympa. Pour NY, il est parmi les moins chers. 40 étages avec une dizaines d'ascenseur, ne chercher pas içi l'hôtel de charme. Nous n'avons jamais attendu pour monter ou descendre car la moitié des ascenseurs sont pour les étages de 1 à 20 et l'autre pour 21 à 40. Nous avions 2 lits de 140 de large alors autant dire qu'il ne faut pas être gros pour dormir à 2 par lit. Les chambres sont plutôt propres, juste assez grande, mais le gros point noir, c'est le bruit. Nous étions au 21ème étage et on entendait très bien les sirènes dans la rue. Comme la fenêtre était mal insonorisée, elle laissait aussi passer le froid. Nous n'avions pas la vue sur l'Empire State building car plus chère.

Lite kaotiskt på hotellet när vi anlände på grund av stormen men fick god service från personalen som gjorde sitt bästa under förutsättningarna. Vi fick flera drink biljetter till hotellets bar på grund av väntetiden. Hotellet körde oss till JFK på grund av bränslekris och svårigheten att få taxi när vi skulle hem. Hotellet har en service disk i receptionen där du kan få hjälp med allt från restaurang val och bokning till tips på hur du planerar din vistelse. Vi bad om att få ett tyst hotell rum som inte låg mot gatan och även om det var lyhört till grannrummen så hörde vi inget av trafiken på utsidan. Läget är enastående.

"“meglio del previsto” Comincio col dire che le critiche all'hotel che avevo letto su tripadvisor si sono rivelate tutte vere: stanza microscopica (impossibile tenere aperta non due ma anche una sola valigia grande), bagno piccolino e vetusto, moquette dal colore indefinito,mancanza di cassaforte e frigo bar in camera, reception poco disponibile, e personale addetto al controllo nella hall che chiacchiera per i fatti suoi...troppi difetti per il prezzo e per avere un ""Molto Buono Tripadvisor"", titolo di cui l'hotel si fregia mettendolo in bella mostra. Tuttavia, oltre alla posizione davvero eccezionale e alla vista (fatevi dare una camera sopra il 30° piano) , ho scoperto alcune qualita' che meritano di essere segnalate: la climatizzazione era regolabile dalla camera, e funzionava bene, il letto comodissimo grazie a un supermaterasso a molle nuovo (e pulito, controllo sempre), il servizio in camera piu' che accettabile, la stanza silenziosa. Inoltre, i due ristoranti aperti 24 ore e collegati dall'interno sono un vantaggio enorme, sia per quando e' tardi e si e' troppo stanchi per girare, sia se succede di beccare Sandy...a tal proposito, l'hotel ha gestito in maniera eccellente questa emergenza, con avvisi scritti, offrendoci di dormire al 2 piano e verificando comunque che avessimo chiuso le finestre...",grifo58,2012-10-01,122005,2012-11-04,False,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Fuimos de viaje de novios y esperábamos que nos dieran alguna habitación especial, pero la verdad es que era bastante corriente. La habitación que nos dieron era más bien pequeña y la decoración te hacía evocar los años 20. Todo parecía antiguo, pero limpio y funcionando. El aire acondicionado sólo tenía 2 posiciones: frío glacial o apagado. Fuimos en septiembre, por lo que se estaba bien con el aire quitado.
Nos tocó la habitación en la planta 26 y apenas se escuchaban ruidos de la calle. 
El restaurante de al lado, es el típico de las películas con los típicos sofás de piel roja, la camarera sirviendo café, super atenta y todo eso. Lo malo es que nos sacudieron como unos 30 dolares por desayunar, eso sí, 2 desayunos completos (cafe, zumo, tostadas, beicon, huevos, etc).

"“La mia casa per un mese” Il New Yorker Hotel, dall'insegna rossa che è uno dei tanti piccoli landmark di Manhattan, è stato la mia casa nel mese a NY per frequentare un corso con la Kaplan Aspect.
Questa scuola d'inglese, con filiali un pò ovunque nel mondo, ha in gestione 2 piani dello stabile dell'hotel, condividendone tutti i servizi e le strutture... in ogni caso la differenza con gli altri piani è notevole. Le camere (singole e doppie con bagno privato) sono in stile dormitorio per studenti, senza troppi fronzoli ma funzionali.. il loro punto forte, ad essere fortunati, è nella vista e la mia finestra dava sull'incrocio tra w34th street e la 8th avenue. Così, uno dei migliori passatempi prima di dormire e appena sveglio era proprio scrutare dall'alto la vita in queste arterie della Grande Mela. Ad ogni piano della residenza c'è anche una cucina mentre la lavanderia è condivisa con l'hotel e si trova al piano -1.
Altri vantaggi nella scelta di questa struttura (sia che ci si rivolga all'hotel che residence Kaplan) sono per la posizione; si è adiacenti a Penn Station e al Madison Square Garden ma vicinissimi a molti dei luoghi fondamentali della città come Times Square e così via..

"“Centrale ma decadente” E' sicuramente un hotel storico e la posizione è fantastica ma necessita di ristrutturazione! Ho soggiornato in una suite e appena entrata ho notato subito i due letti queen anzichè un bel letto king....ero molto scocciata! Continuando il mio giro di perlustrazione della camera sono arrivata nel bagno e li ho ricevuto il colpo di grazia! Bagno piccolissimo con la vasca e la tenda per la doccia....ma chi usa ancora le tende nelle docce??? Ti si appiccicano addosso mentre ti lavi!!! In più il doccino era davvero fastidioso perchè usciva un solo getto potentissimo che faceva anche male, fortunatamente mio marito riusciva a sistemarlo in qualche modo prima di usarlo...La nota davvero positiva era la vista...la camera era al trentanovesimo piano e davanti a noi si poteva ammirare l'Empire State Building e il Chrysler!

"“Un cumpleanos feliz” Encontre este hotel por Tripadvisor y me parecio bueno, lo compare con otros y por precio, calidad y ubicacion, cumplia todos los requisitos para pasar mi cumpleanos N 40 en New York. Esta en medio del ajetreo de NY, justo donde hay miles de personas transitando, hay de todo cerca, a pasos del Madison Square Garden, bares, buenos restaurantes y a alrededor de 6 cuadras de Times Square. Es barato respecto de otros hoteles que estan en Soho, pero debes pedir pieza sobre la 45 porque creo... son mas grandes y espaciosas, me habian dado una como en el piso 10, sin ventanas y no cabia ni un velador, en el cambio... perfecto, hasta con vista al Hudson. Lo recomiendo para un viaje justo, si quieres lujo... no es el hotel indicado, si quieres cercania y precio, si lo es. Es antiguo pero bien cuidado, no habia ruidos molestos y la atencion muy buena, incluso compre almohadas y no tuvieron ningun problema en venderlas.

Limpieza correcta, y al tener tantas habitaciones y trasiego de huéspedes lógicamente la atención del personal es bastante fría pero correcta. Se habla, con en casi todas partes en NY, español.

"“The New Yorker lebt von seiner Lage..” Das Hotel überzeugt einzig in seiner Lage - diese ist einfach perfekt! 
Wir hatten ein Eckzimmer im 33. Stock mit Sicht auf das Chrysler und Empire State Building.
Durch das Eckzimmer hatten wir vergleichsweise noch etwas Glück, da diese etwas größen sind, als die ""normalen"" Zimmer. Geräusche von der Straße kommen natürlich auch im 33. Stock noch an, aber es ist auszuhalten. Für diejenigen mit schlechten Schlaf lohnen sich sicherlich Ohropax.
Die Zimmer waren weitestgehend sauber. Der Teppich dennoch etwas unappetitlich. 
Das Bad war ebefalls nicht sehr groß, aber ausreichend. 
Wer verbringt in New York auch schon viel Zeit im Zimmer?? 
Kommen wir zurück auf die Lage des Hotels: diese ist einfach toll. Quasi direkt neben dem Eingang ist der Zugang zur Subway. Macy's ist innerhalb von 3-5Minuten zu Fuß zu erreichen und auch der Times Square ist nahezu um die Ecke! 
Auch zu den restlichen Ausflugszielen innerhalb Manhattans kommt man sehr schnell. 
Wir haben im Hotel das Fitneßstudio genutzt, welches gut ausgestattet ist für ein wenig fit zu halten während des Urlaubs. 
Abgesehen vom Check-In, welcher nicht sehr freundlich von statten ging, hatten wir glücklicherweise keine Notwendigkeit uns mit dem Personal auseinander zu setzen.

"“Per uno studente c'è tutto e di più!” Ho soggiornato al New Yorker nel settembre del 2011 ed ero lì per una vacanza-studio. Seguivo le lezioni all'empire state building e chi mi ha organizzato il viaggio ha trovato per me questa sistemazione. Quando mi sono ritrovata di fronte all'hotel pensavo di aver sbagliato perchè era veramente un lusso, poi quando sono entrata ho capito.. parte dell'hotel è occupata da camere un pò più ""scarse"" proprio per studenti o altro.. quindi camere molto minimali con due letti (o di più o singola) bagno, due scrivanie e un armadio: lo stretto indispensabile per uno studente. C'è poi in 2 piani una cucina in comune con tutti gli altri ragazzi e li si trovano 3 piani cottura grandissimi, due lavelli, il forno a microonde, la tv, i divani e i tavoli su cui mangiare. Una delle due è veramente grande (ci si fanno anche le feste), mentre l'altra, nella sua grandezza, è un pò più piccola. L'hotel però non è solo così, ovviamente gran parte invece è dedicata a chi vuole soggiornare in maniera più confort! C'è a disposizione una palestra con attrezzi di ultima generazione marchiati technogym, nella stessa sala 2 televisori, tutto il necessario per esercizi di aerobica o pilates e tanto spazio. Inoltre c'è anche una lavanderia enorme con una decina e passa di lavatrici a gettoni: tutto questo in una stanza grandissima con tv e spazio. Ah dimenticavo che ci sono anche le asciugatrici.

"“non saprei...” Dunque, premetto che eravamo già preparati al fatto che si arrivava a New York e che la città è molto cara... Sapevamo già che le camere non sarebbero state molto grandi... Durante il Check-in abbiamo ottenuto una camera di tipologia Queen, nonostante la prenotazione indicasse una Double. La persona alla reception ci ha accolti molto gentilmente, dicendo che la camera era al 21esimo piano e che la vista sarebbe stata niente male, inoltre ci ha consegnato due cioccolatini, poichè eravamo honeymooners.
Nonostante avessimo enormemente appezzato il gesto,arrivati in camera ci è venuto subito da ridere, perchè è molto piccola ed effettivamente non c'è spazio nemmeno per aprire le valigie. C'è giusto il ripostiglio, che è quasi grande come il bagno, da usare per creare spazio utile. Non era brutta, effettivamente la vista non era male...però... in un due stelle forse avremmo avuto una camera un pelino più grande! Certo è che quando si entra l'elegante hall fa una gran bella impressione, poi però la camera ti delude un po'. Sembra più un piccolo loculo. La struttura è molto datata. Gli ascensori sono però velocissimi e non ricordo di aver aspettato più di 1-2 minuti. La posizione è perfetta, tra l'8th e la 34th vicino a Time Square, all'Empire e alla stazione della Metro Penn Street. Di fronte c'è un ristorante che fa della buona pizza e insalata, di fianco a locali di molte catene del tipo StarBucks o Mc Donald's, ma direi che a New York ad ogni angolo c'è sempre qualcosa... Non abbiamo esperienza diretta del ristorante dell'hotel. Una coppia di italiani incontrati per caso durante il check-in ci ha detto che non è male.

Time Square, Central Park, West Side, East Side etc. sind fußläufig zu erreichen.
Auch die nächste U-Bahn Station und das größte Kaufhaus NY´s (Macy`s) sind schnell erreichbar.

Il est à 5 min à pieds de Penn Station, pour peu que vous arriviez de Newark avec l'Airtrain, c'est appréciable ! Macy's, Empire State Building , Madison Square Garden, tout est à proximité.

Le soir surtout c'est magnifique. Point de vue isolation par contre c'était moins bien, et puis les chambres à côté de la nôtre étaient chambres fumeur et je dois dire que parfois l'odeur arrivait dans notre chambre. 
Pour le petit déj vous avez juste à descendre à la réception à côté des ascenseurs, là ils vendent café, thé , chocolats, croissants, donuts ... bref tout !

Avevo una camera al 37esimo piano e la vista dalla camera era fantastica.
La camera non è grandissima, ma c'è tutto il necessario...il letto è comodo, c'è una tv grande, è pulita e confortevole
Il bagno non è un granchè, un pò vecchio con un lavandino scomodo per lavarsi, ma comunque accettabile...
L'hotel è enorme e si divide in due parti...fino al 20°esimo piano c'è il residence che è utilizzato perlopiù da studenti che vanno a studiare inglese in scuole come la Kaplan che è vicino all'hotel...le camere in questa parte dell'hotel non sono ovviamente un granchè, sono piccole, scomode e senza vista ma ovviamente costa assai meno quindi conviene come alternativa all'appartamento se stati per periodi medio-lunghi (oltre 2 settimane)
Poi ci sono le camere dal 20° al 40° piano che sono le camere del vero hotel e sono tutte ben tenute e confortevoli...ovviamente questa parte dell'hotel costa molto di più.
L'hotel dispone di un servizio di lavanderia utilizzabile da chiunque (anche se formalmente solo dagli studenti che alloggiano nel residence) e il prezzo è di 2$ a lavaggio e altri 2$ per l'asciugatrice (più i 5$ per fare la tessera).
E' presente anche una palestra
C'è anche un ristorante collegato con l'hotel in cui potete mangiare qualcosa...

Grossi difetti non ne abbiamo riscontrati : la camera era piccola , ma c'era tutto , e per due persone per un soggiorno di pochi giorni è sufficiente , bagno un po' datato ma funzionale e con tutto il necessario.
Vista molto bella dalla nostra stanza.
Pulizia impeccabile in tutta la struttura , sia parti comuni che in camera.
Letto comodo.
Un problema a nostro avviso è la rumorosità: senti tutto quello che avviene in strada dal 35° piano, e le camere, come spesso avviene nelle grandi città ,sono poco insonorizzate e se ti capita il vicino ""vivace"" non è il massimo...col fuso sul groppone può diventare fastidioso , considerando anche quanto è movimentata NY!
Connessione wi-fi praticamente inutilizzabile , di una lentezza disarmante.
Fermate metro e Penn station a due passi.
Intorno ci sono una miriade di luoghi in cui mangiare.
Nel complesso siamo rimasti soddisfatti , la valutazione è 3 invece di 4 per il prezzo.",trudy80,2012-06-01,122005,2012-07-06,False,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Bonne situation, bon rapport qualité/prix” En lisant les différents avis, j'avais très peur de la taille des chambres, New York ayant une réputation d'avoir peu d'espace et des chambres d'hôtel très petites. Finalement, j'ai trouvé la taille de la chambre convenable, d'autant plus que vous passerez sans doute la plupart de votre temps dehors. Ne vous attendez pas à un palace. 
Nous y sommes restés en tout 4 nuits. Notre chambre au 17e étage (pas de vue, malheureusement) était propre et contenait un lit confortable, un bureau, une télé. La salle de bain était aussi convenable, bien que légèrement vieillie. L'hôtel a sans doute voulu conserver les équipements d'époque pour conserver l'esprit art/déco. 
Je recommande fortement le restaurant de l'hôtel, qui sert des plats de cuisine locale qui sont délicieux. Il est idéal pour les jours de grande fatigue où vous préférerez sans doute ne pas sortir de l'hôtel. Le personnel du restaurant y est très aimable.
Point négatif : les personnes à l'accueil sont un peu froides.

"“Bien ubicado-sin desayuno” El hotel está muy bien ubicado, a dos bloques del Empire State, muy cerca de Times Square y con el metro ahí nomás para ir a cualquier parte, también al lado de la Penn Station que conecta con practicamente todo.

Las habitaciones son pequeñas pero en buen estado y al menos en nuestro caso con una vista espectacular desde el piso 37 que nos tocó- Justo al lado tiene un ""dinner"" habierto las 20hs con buen menú a precios razonables, como dije, lo bueno es que está abierto siempre.

"“Excellent pied-à-terre newyorkais !” Nous avons séjourné 7 nuits au New Yorker su 7 au 12 avril 2012.

En effet, le Central Park est à 20 minutes, l'Empire State Building est à 5 minutes, Chelsea est tout près et tout Midtown est à portée de main. Même Soho est à une distance faisable à pied. On a juste pris le métro pour Brooklyn et Lower Manhattan. En ce qui concerne l'hôtel, une fois passé rapidement et de façon très professionnelle le check-in, nous avons prise possession de notre chambre Metro Renovated au 28ème étage. La chambre n'est pas énorme, mais en connaissant le standard de ville comme New York et Londres, on s'attendait à plus petit. Le lit double est de taille convenable et surtout la literie est vraiment d'excellente qualité. Une table minuscule avec une chaise, une télé petite sur le mur, avec plein de chaines. La salle de bain, bien que petite, est confortable avec baignoire. Pas de bruit pour nous au 28ème, on avait les boules Quiès car on avait vu quelques commentaires dans ce sens, peut-être c'est plus le cas dans les étages inférieurs.

Das Zimmer war zwar klein aber sauber. Mit allzu viel Gepäck sollte man allerdings nicht unterwegs sein. Es gibt einen kleinen Wandschrank und eine Kommode mit vier Schubladen und eine Schreibtisch mit Stuhl davor. Ein Flachbild TV hängt an der Wand und das war's dann.
Dafür ist das Bad verhältnismäßig groß. Hatte bestimmt die Hälfte der Größe des Zimmers !

Kamers zijn prima, goed te doen voor 2 personen. Voor erg grote/brede mensen is het 2 persoonsbed misschien iets aan de kleine kant met zn 2-en, maar ligt er natuurlijk aan welke kamer je hebt. Badkamer ook prima. Bij lekkage gelijk andere kamer gekregen, daar geen last meer gehad.
Als je aan de voorkant, of nog aan de voor-/zijkant zit, heb je mooi uitzicht op het Empire State Building. Aan de zijkant op Madison Square Garden (ligt er wel aan welke zijkant natuurlijk).
The New Yorker is een super groot hotel, erg grote lobby beneden waar altijd mensen zijn en genoeg ruimte om te zitten. Het hotel heeft een aantal verdiepingen voor studentenkamers, voor bedrijven, voor conventies en de rest is hotel. Gasten van het hotel hebben hier verder allemaal geen last van. Het hotel is zo groot dat je het niet merkt. Af en toe is het door de conventies wel erg druk in de lobby met allerlei bezoekers die van verdieping 1 naar 2 naar 3 gaan met de lift. Opvallend was dat er in de lobby vaak wat mis was; of de draaideur is weer stuk, of de roltrappen naar beneden (naar de fitnessruimte, business center en souvenir winkeltje), die wisselen elkaar zo ongeveer af.
Ontbijt kan beneden in de Tik Tok diner, prima, echt Amerikaans voor degenen die daar van houden. Het gaat snel en het is niet heel erg persoonlijk. Maar het personeel is wel vriendelijk. Je kunt ook iets kleins halen bij het 'kraampje' in de lobby. Maar elders in de stad wat halen is net zo handig. Dineren kan ook in de diner, maar ook in Cooper's Tavern, het restaurant naast het hotel. Heerlijk eten!

"“Superbe situation !” L'un des hôtels les plus anciens de New York, mais récemment rénové. Style années 30. L'un des ""monuments historiques"" de la ville (et l'un des hôtels les plus visibles de Manhattan, même de loin !)
*** Les points positifs :
- Un emplacement absolument parfait pour découvrir la ville ! Stations de métro au pied de l'hôtel, Times Square à 10 minutes à pieds, Macy's à 5 minutes, les grands magasins de Broadway et de la 5ème avenue proches... Difficile de faire mieux !
- Chambre bien propre
- Literie confortable
- Bonne insonorisation
- Wi-fi gratuit et illimité dans toutes les chambres (mais payant pour le très haut débit)
- Restaurant au pied de l'hôtel ouvert 24/24 (prix corrects, service pas terrible mais assiettes copieuses. Pas mal pour le petit déjeuner.)
*** Les points négatifs :
- Accueil assez froid et impersonnel
- Chambre (type ""Metro room"") très petite
- Quasiment aucun rangement (à part un minuscule placard)
- Salle de bain un peu vieillote, mais propre
- Dans la chambre ne se trouve aucun des petits ""bonus"" habituels des hôtels : petits chaussons, peignoirs, couverture supplémentaire... Bref, c'est le strict minimum

- Bon rapport qualité-prix pour l'emplacement. Ce n'est pas l'hôtel du siècle, mais en même temps, à New York, on reste finalement très peu de temps à l'hôtel !

"“Frisch renoviertes Hotel mit hervorragender Lage” Das beste an diesem Hotel ist die angenehme Lage. Direkt bei der Penn Station sowie einigen subway Stationen. Auch der Busterminal ist nicht weit entfernt. In 10-12 min ist man zu Fuß am Times Square. Macys sowie das Empire State Building befinden sich auf derselben Straße und sind ebenfalls innerhalb von 10 min zu Fuß zu erreichen.
Außerdem wurde mittlerweile das gesamte Hotel neu renoviert. Ich war innerhalb der letzten 3 Jahre viermal Gast und werde bei meinem nächsten Besuch wieder dort logieren.
Das Hausinterne Tick Tock Diner ist auch wärmstens zu empfehlen.
Einziges kleines Manko ist das Fehlen von Kühlschränken sowie eines Safes. Einen Kühlschrank hatten wir nur in der Suite im 39. Stock, die jedoch wie auch sehr viele Zimmer einen wunderschönen Ausblick hat.

"“Nel cuore di Manhattan” Ho soggiornato al The New Yorker per una settimana dal 6 al 13 gennaio. L'hotel ha un suo fascino in quanto datato ai primi del novecento. Non ha subito evidenti ristrutturazioni il che gli conferisce un'area retrò molto interessante. Le stanza sono mediamente molto piccole. Ho chiesto i piani alti per poter godere di migliore vista e sono stata accontentata. Purtroppo la stanza era veramente claustrofobica e ho domandato in reception se era possibile cambiarla. 
Sono stata accontentata, senza upgrade, l'indomani (l'hotel era pieno). Ho apprezzato. Non era di certo enorme ma per me assolitamente sufficiente. Il bagno è rimasto come negli anni '20. Rubinetteria originale e mattonelline alle pareti. Nel complesso molto pulito. Non è attivo il servizio breakfast ma si hanno varie alternative fronte hotel (starbucks e vari ed eventuali) o presso il bar/ristorante collegato all'albergo (niente latte) per consumare la colazione. L'hotel è in posizione perfetta. Andavo a Times Square a piedi (a qualsasi ora del giorno e della notte) in 10/13 minuti a piedi. Ad un passo dall'Empire, da Macy, Madison Square Garden.

L'hotel è vecchiotto ma la stanza, una New Yorker Deluxe con due letti situata al 19.mo piano, è risultata accogliente e spaziosa e siamo pure riuscita ad ottenerla con due bagni. I bagni forse sono comunque un po' piccoli e datati. La pulizia è complessivamente buona. Check-in e check-out senza problemi, abbiamo anche potuto prenotare in hotel lo shuttle per andare in aeroporto alla nostra partenza da NYC. Vi sconsiglio di mangiare al diner Tic-Toc per più di una sera e per la colazione è perfetto l'IGK che trovate appena usciti dall'hotel camminando verso sinistra sull'Ottava Avenue.",201006,2012-03-01,122005,2012-03-30,False,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“Sehr gute Lage aber etwas abgewohnt, laut und kein guter Service!” Meine Frau und ich hatten dieses Hotel für einen kurzen New York Aufenthalt gebucht, weil es sehr gut gelegen und gut bewertet war. Ab der Lage gibt es wirklich überhaupt nichts auszusetzen. Das Hotel sieht von außen sehr beeindruckend aus und auch die Halle ist architektonisch sehr ansprechend. Leider verströmt der Raum aber durch die vielen, vielen Personen, die mit Koffern auf den Sofas hocken, eher Bahnhofshallenathmosphäre als Gemütlichkeit. Die Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption arbeiten effizient (um es mal freundlich auszudrücken). Ein Lächeln oder freundliches Wort ist eher nicht zu erwarten. Man bekommt eher vermittelt zu stören, wenn man einen Wunsch äußert. Auf die Nachfrage nach einem Adapter für die Steckdose erhielten wir lediglich den Hinweis, der Drugstore auf der anderen Straßenseite hätte rund um die Uhr geöffnet. Von einem Hotel dieser Kategorie erwarte ich mir da anderes!
Unser Zimmer war - wie in NY üblich - klein. Aber das hatten wir nicht anders erwartet. Problematischer allerdings war, dass die Wasserleitungen einen solchen Druck hatten, dass wir jedes Mal wach wurden, wenn im Nachbarzimmer auch nur der Wasserhahn aufgedreht wurde.

Ben organizzata, nella grande hall, la reception, nonostante l'afflusso continuo di turisti: veloci ed efficienti, anche se non particolarmente cordiali. Noi dovevamo fermarci una settimana ed inizialmente ci avevano assegnato una camera con vista verso l'Empire State Building, ma era piccola tanto da non trovare posto dove aprire il bagaglio. Ci hanno comunque subito sostituito la stanza, con una molto spaziosa, con vista meravigliosa sul retro dell'hotel...sul fiume Hudson. Molto suggestivo specie la sera! Camere dall'arredamento un pò datato ma comunque pulite. Bagni spartani e un pò piccoli.
La comodità di questo hotel è che, tra le altre cose, è situato vicino alla Penn Station, ci si arriva diretti dall'aeroporto o da altri posti (noi siamo arrivati da Washington in treno..). Fermate di autobus e metro tutte vicino. Colazione nel ristorante adiacente ad un prezzo ragionevole, ma in un angolo della hall c'è un piccolo baretto dove puoi prendere un caffè, brioche o succhi di frutta, senza però posto a sedere.",andromedas,2011-08-01,122005,2012-01-15,False,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“New York anni 50” In piena Midtown vicinissimo a molte delle principali attrazioni di NY. Un solo isolato da Macy's e dal Madison Square Garden, tre isolati (verso ovest) dall'Empire State Building, (verso est) dalla Fifth Avenue e (verso nord) da Times Square. E' molto vicino anche alla Penn Station, punto di partenza per eventuali escursioni fuori città. Insomma, il punto forte è decisamente la posizione. L'albergo è un palazzo degli anni 50 molto noto a NY. La hall fa veramente impressione, l'accoglienza non è particolarmente calorosa, ma considerato il numero di ospiti (ci sono 900 camere) il servizio è comunque efficiente. Dall'albergo si possono prenotare taxi, teatri, ristoranti, ecc. Esiste anche un souvenir shop per gli acquisti dell'ultimo minuto a prezzi convenienti. Le camere sono piccole, ma pulite e con una vista spettacolare (eravamo al 36° piano). Diverso il discorso per il bagno: cieco, piccolo e decisamente da rinnovare. Il miscelatore della doccia (nella vasca) deve essere quello originale. La colazione conviene farla fuori hotel. A due passi ci sono Starbucks e Dunkin' Donuts, ma conviene fare 100 metri in più e andare da Guy & Gallard o Dean & De Luca. Riepilogando: per NY ottimo hotel per rapporto posizione-qualità-prezzo.

"“¡¡Súper bien ubicado!!” Mi mamá y yo nos hospedamos en este hotel hace varios días y nos pareció excelente. La ubicación del hotel estaba súper, el metro a la vuelta de la entrada al hotel. Nos tocó una vista extraordinaria. La habitación sí es pequeña pero por lo que he escuchado casi todos los hoteles son por el estilo. Para dos personas esta muy bien. Tiene internet gratis y no es tan lento. El personal que nos atendió fue muy amable, también las camaristas, siempre estaba todo limpio. El baño no está nada mal, menos si vas a andar turisteando durante el día. Tal vez si está algo caro pero es por la época además el servicio que se nos dio fue de primera. El TicToc diner que está a un lado lo dejaría sólo para emergencias ya que hay cosas buenísimas para comer en otros lados. Si vas o no de compras está de lujo el Macy´s a una cuadra. Definitivamente sí volvería a este hotel.

"“Shining.” Il New Yorker è un hotel che fa un po' paura. Dall'esterno è una costruzione monolitica che si erge in alto con tante piccole finestre che sembrano le feritoie di una prigione; l'interno, con le sue pesanti moquette e i toni arancioni-grigiastri-giallino-nicotina ricorda l'Overlook hotel di Stephen King. Il servizio è assente. Solo una guardia di sicurezza che minacciosa chiede di poter vedere la chiave della vostra stanza prima di accedere alla dozzina di ascensori. La nostra camera era minuscola, pochissimo spazio per riporre le due valigie, una piccola finestra con scorcio parziale sulla città. Il bagno piccolo con una doccia mal funzionante, non regolabile nel gettito e dalla temperatura massima a dir tanto tiepida (non il massimo per una doccia rigenerante dopo aver corso la maratona di New York). Il secondo giorno si sono dimenticati di cambiare la carta igienica. Del frigo bar in camera ovviamente nessuna traccia, come della cassaforte.
Se decidete di pernottare in questo vetusto edificio che puzza di vecchio e stantio, in cambio avrete solo il beneficio di essere al centro di Manahttan, a due passi da Times Square, tre dal Madison Squadre Garden e una breve passeggiata da Broadway. La metro è vicinissima (ma a New York c'è una fermata ad ogni angolo) e nelle immediate vicinanze c'è un buon diner (non andate a quello d'angolo) per una colazione americana a buon prezzo.
Il prezzo è decisamente esagerato per gli inesistenti servizi offerti. Con un po' di tempo a disposizione si trova, a minor prezzo, decisamente di meglio a New York. Spendendo la stessa cifra o poco più sicuramente si trova posto in un albergo di fascia medio alta.

"“Hier zählt die Lage (...und das wissen die auch)” Das war mein 3. NYC-Besuch und das dritte Hotel. Von der Penn-Station sind es keine 100m, was praktisch ist nach einer langen Anreise! Man freut sich. Der CheckIn war dann aber schon gleich wieder weniger erfreulich. Kein HALLO oder SCHÖN DAS SIE DA SIND oder WIE WAR DIE ANREISE. Alles sehr ruppig, unpersönlich, unfreundlich. Die Dame wollte auch BEIDE Pässe sehen, was ich ungewöhnlich fand! 
Gut, dann das Zimmer. Wir hatten ein Zimmer in den oberen Etagen gebucht (38-42). Das kostet 100 Euro mehr die Nacht. Man wird beim aufstehen und zu Bett gehen mit einem fantastischen Blick belohnt und hört von dem Verkehr auf den Straßen absolut nichts. Das ist sehr entspannend. Schließlich ist man 
in dieser Stadt schon den ganzen Tag von einer enormen Geräuschkulisse umgeben. Wir hatten ein kleines Wohnzimmer mit Couch, Sessel, Schreibtisch, Küchenzeile samt Kaffeemaschine und TV und ein Schlafzimmer (Bettwäsche hatte sehr gute Qualität) ebenfalls mit Fernseher und einem Kleiderschrank. Das Bad ist klein. Das Zimmer an sich ist sehr hellhörig. Aber das ist typisch NY und nix zum meckern. Alles ist sehr 
sauber. Das Housekeeping arbeitet gut! 
Was man sich echt sparen kann, ist das Zimmer mit Frühstück zu buchen. Es wird mit Buffet in der Sky Lounge geworben. Dort stehen dann lieblos gerade mal 5 kleine Bistrotische, keine Tischdecke und wieder wird man unfreundlich empfangen. Das Buffet selbst ist ein Tisch und besteht aus Bageln, diversen Kuchen und Zuckerflakes, Kaffee, Tee und abgepackten Marmeladen, CreamCheese und Honig. Dazu gibts Kaffee aus der Thermoskanne. Alles sehr lieblos da oben. Dabei könnte das eine Goldgrube sein. Ein paar Tischdecken, Blumen..Die Auswahl kontinentaler und weniger amerikanisch gestalten. Wäre mein Tipp. Unten im Haus gibt es das TickTok Diner. Ein 24h Diner. Hat was von Speisesaal. Sehr groß, sehr 
laut. Qualitativ so la la. 
Mein Rat: 1. lieber das Geld für die oberen Etagen ausgeben! Nach einem anstrengenden City-Tag ist es viel wert, nicht in einem Schuhkarton von Zimmer heimkehren zu müssen, sondern sich ein bißchen ausbreiten zu können. 
2. Lieber ohne Frühstück. Die Aussicht aus der SkyLounge hat man auch vom Zimmer und um die Ecke gibts bessere Frühstücksalternativen. 
Die Frage, ob ich es weiter empfehlen würde, muss ich hier mit JA oder NEIN beantworten, es wäre aber eher ein JEIN.

Aún así, yo he estado en otros hoteles en zona similar y a precio también similar y éste me ha parecido mejor. En primer lugar, porque tenía una habitación con unas vistas espectaculares al Empire State. Buenas camas, moqueta (como todos). Lo peor, el baño. Parece que es el mismo desde 1929! El hotel es un hotel con todas las letras, no un hotel boutique. Cuenta con todos los servicios: business center (de pago), restaurante 24 horas, etc. Tiene Wifi gratis en las habitaciones y en el lobby que funciona fenomenal, y hay una opción de más velocidad, ya de pago. Personal muy amable, lo normal en NY. Los ascensores, muchos y rapidísimos (parece una tontería pero en otros hoteles puede llegar a ser desesperante).
La zona está muy bien comunicada, boca de metro (Penn Station) al lado, Madison Square Garden enfrente, se va a pie en cinco minutos a Macy's y en 10 minutos tanto al Empire State como a Times Square. Aunque en sí la zona no tiene gran cosa más que ver.

"“Un accueil déplorable” Nous avons séjourné 4 nuits au New Yorker Hotel. L'accueil a été plutôt glacial lors de notre arrivée! le personnel au front desk était vraiment désagréable et expéditif. Le même constat a été fait lorsque nous sommes partis et que nous avons payé la chambre. Nous avons eu le droit à des soufflements, à des yeux au ciel lorsque nous avons demandé à partager la note. Au prix où nous avons payé la chambre, je m'attendais à un minimum d'amabilité et de service!!!!!!! Nous ne sommes qu'un numéro dans une véritable usine! Le personnel de chambre est en revanche très agréable.
La chambre en elle-même était assez grande pour 5 adultes (2 lits, un canapé convertible, 2 salles de bain avec WC). Chambre assez vieillotte (surtout les salles de bain qui auraient besoin d'être rénovées) mais propre. Une chambre correcte finalement. Nous étions au 25ème étage: on entend quand même le bruit de la ville mais c'est tout à fait supportable.

"“Ottima posizione!” Questo hotel si trova sull'ottava strada vicino all'incrocio con la trentaquattresima a circa un chilomtero di distanza dall'Empire State Building. E' in ottima posizione per visitare Manhattan poichè si raggiunge facilmente a piedi Times Square, la 5^ strade, Park Avenue. 
L'Hotel è un vecchio grattacielo di 40 piani ristrutturato con tantissime camere (cosa usuale a NY). Io ho soggiornato al 29° piano con camera doppia con due letti queen size, anche se eravamo in coppia. In effetti lo consiglio perchè il letto queen size per due è proprio piccolo e la differenza di prezzo non è molta. La camera era sufficientemente spaziosa, i letti comodi anche se corti, peccato per l'assenza di frigo bar. Il bagno è piccolo e un po' vecchiotto ma comunque accettabile. La pulizia discreta, il bagno risente un po' della ristrutturazione approssimativa. Il servizio è buono anche se in hotel ci si va solo per dormire perchè in effetti non offre altro.

"“Buena ubicación” Hace algunas semanas estuve por 4ª vez en este hotel. Lo mejor que tiene es la ubicación, está a 4 pasos (literalmente) del metro, a dos cuadras de Penn Station y está cerca de varios lugares de interés en el Down town. En los alrededores hay una buena cantidad de tiendas, restaurantes y cafés, en un entorno bastante seguro.
Si bien el edificio es antiguo, está bien tenido, conservando un encanto especial. Las habitaciones y baños son limpios y funcionan correctamente. 
Eso sí, las habitaciones son minúsculas; no es recomendable para los que gustan pasar mucho tiempo en ellas, pero para dormir y descansar el espacio es suficiente. 
El servicio en general es bueno, el personal del hotel es muy amable, aunque cuando hay mucha gente la conserje no es capaz de atender tantos requerimientos y se hacen filas bastante largas. En el mismo hotel se pueden comprar entradas a tours y espectáculos.
A cada costado del hotel hay un restaurante: Tavern's Cooper y Tick Tock. El primero es muy bueno para tomar y comer algo, hay buen ambiente y una carta de cervezas razonable; el segundo en cambio deja bastante que desear, la carta es reducida y la atención es lenta y algo ruda, además que la limpieza no parece ser su primera preocupación. 
En resumen, para los que estamos dispuestos a soportar una habitación pequeña, el hotel es una excelente alternativa por el buen trato, la limpieza y la ubicación.",Altazor_2011,2011-09-01,122005,2011-10-11,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

"“HOTEL IN POSIZIONE STRATEGICA A NEW YORK” Arrivati all’Hotel New Yorker del gruppo Ramada sulla 34^, angolo 8^, ci sono state attribuite le due camere: noi al 21° piano con vista sull’Empire Building e gli amici al 23° piano con tre finestre che guardano sopra i palazzi sino all’Hudson. Uno spettacolo! 
Peccato che cominci a piovere. L’Empire ha la punta immersa nella nebbia. Devo dire, peraltro, che avevo scelto questo hotel per la categoria (3 ½), la posizione (la 34^), ma soprattutto per il punteggio ricevuto dai clienti di Expedia : 4.1 su 5. Io darei però qualcosa in meno. E’ un bel grattacielo di 40 piani art decò, le camere sono piccole ma con 2 comodi letti queen (con piccolo sovrapprezzo al posto del matrimoniale che gli americani normalmente utilizzano, ma è una piazza e mezza). Ma in camera non c’è il frigo, il bollitore per the o caffè e non c’è neppure una cuffia per la doccia: strano! Va bene, siamo soddisfatti lo stesso, usciamo e sotto una pioggerellina leggera facciamo una breve passeggiata verso l’Empire; è già Natale per luci ed addobbi ed abbiamo quindi cenato proprio sotto l’hotel e alle 22.30 locali siamo andati a letto, ma erano già 23 ore che eravamo in piedi.

Devant me rendre pour l'Assemblée Générale des Nations Unies, ce qui veut dire un agenda chargé mais pas toujours fixe et donc devant manger dans un endroit pratique surtout ouvert jour et nuit avec avant de partir la possibilité de ramener quelques souvenirs choisis en vitesse, cet hotel m'a donné toutes ces satisfactions .Le choix des chambres est étendu avec des prix très abordables. Son restaurant Tic-Toc est ouvert tout le temps avec des plats variés, et au sous-sol la boutique m'a permis de trouver des rasoirs , des adaptateurs électriques pour mon ordinateur et quelques souvenirs achetés avant de prendre un taxi pour l'aéroport.

"“Meilleur souvenir!” Je suis partie avec ma soeur jumelle et ma meilleure amie du 18 au 25 aoùt 2011 pour nos 18 ans dans cet hotel et tout ce que je peux faire c'est vous le recommander! 
- Petit problème en arrivant qui nous as très bien arrangé: nous avions commander une chambre deux lits double et en arrivant à la récéption, ils n'en avaient plus pour nous, ils nous ont donc proposer une chambre bien plus grande au dernier étage avec plusieurs fenêtres et vues incroyables! Merci le manque de place :D ! 
- Contrairement à certains commentaires, on a trouvé l'hotel très très calme contrairement à d'autre notemment près de ground zero par exemple (peut-être dû à l'^étage où nous étions)
- j'ai lu que certaines personnes ont payé pour avoir un frigo, personelement, je ne vois pas l'interêt étant donné que le frigo est déjà dans la chambre... Je vous conseil de l'utiliser sans le déclarer -> ils n'iront pas fouiller pour vérifier que le frigo est bien non-utilisé!
- Chambres très propres, sans problème de petits cafards et insectes bien connus à NY
- Salle de sport vraiment bien et gratuite
- Hôtel super bien placé -> vous verrez time square, le chrysler, l'empire state et le port juste à coté de votre chambre!
- Restaurant ""Tik Tok"" très bon et prix très convenables!
- Les gens de la réception sont vraiment acceuillants et vous aideront dès qu'ils le pourront!
Attention: en arrivant, l'hotel vous demandera 300 dollards en liquide ou par carte pour la caution qu'ils vous rendrons le jour de votre départ, si, comme nous, vous ne le saviez pas, prenez-en compte dans votre budget pour ne pas vous retrouvez sans un sous à NY!
- si vous réservez pour le petit déjeuner compris, sachez que vous n'aurez droit qu'à soit un baggel, soit muffin ou encore un toast par personne ce qui n'est pas top du tout! Sinon comptez 9 dollards pour un bon petit déjeuner!
Apparement, les chambres sont assez petites mais vous passerez vraiment très très peu de temps dedans, c'est juste un détail!

"“Stanza mini” Detto che se guardo il costo della camera il voto sarebbe davvero scarso bisogna rassegnarsi a quanto è cara NYC (soprattutto se hai fatto la vacanza negli USA centrali dove tutto costa davvero poco). L'albergo è enorme, con nessuna atmosfera, grande ed asettico con un via vai di gente continua. la nostra camera era davvero piccola però era già rifatta e pulita. l'albergo è vecchio e nelle parti comuni che non siano la hall si vede. Chiedendo al concierge per andare all'aeroporto vi chiederanno 75 dollari (in tre) e vi accompagneranno con auto privata. Se prendete il taxi c'è una tariffa flat di 45 dollari.

"“Limpio, seguro y bien ubicado” El hotel fue inaugurado en 1929, y en consecuencia su apariencia es la de un gran hotel de los años 30. No es precisamente un hotel de lujo, ni muy bonito, pero a nosotros nos parece que tiene su encanto y que está bien conservado, bien ubicado y bien comunicado con el resto de la ciudad a través de varias líneas de metro. Para llegar al hotel desde el aeropuerto JFK sólo se necesita subir a la línea A hasta Penn Station. 
 Muchas de las personas que trabajan en el hotel hablan español, y con nosotros fueron muy amables. Nos hemos alojado 8 noches en una habitación ""queen size con vistas"". Como no nos gustaron las vistas de la habitación (al río Hudson, pero se veía lejos), en la que dormimos las dos primeras noches, preguntamos si nos la podían cambiar por otra que diera al Empire State Building, y no nos pusieron problema, así que las 6 noches restantes hemos disfrutado de unas vistas impresionantes. Además nos hemos sentido muy seguros, pues siempre hay personal del hotel vigilando para que personas que no estén alojadas puedan subir a las habitaciones. 
 Las dos habitaciones en las que nos hemos quedado, una en la planta 24, y otra en la planta 28, estaban limpias y el mobiliario en buen estado. Las camas son bastante cómodas. Aunque no son muy espaciosas, se agradece que las habitaciones tengan un pequeño armario empotrado, suficiente para guardar las maletas y las compras y colgar alguna ropa. No tienen minibar, pero en varias plantas existen máquinas expendedoras de bebidas, frutos secos, chocolatinas... Tampoco tienen servicio para hacerte un té o café, pero tienen un televisor de pantalla plana de 40 pulgadas y una tabla de planchar con su plancha, que a nosotros nos fue útil. 
 No llevábamos incluido el desayuno, así que la primera mañana entramos en la cafetería restaurante que está en el mismo edificio que el hotel ""Tick Tock Dinner"". Nos atendieron muy bien y el desayuno estaba muy bueno, con porciones muy grandes, pero nos resultó un poco caro (35$ con la propina incluida), así que no volvimos a ir. En los alrededores hay muchos sitios donde desayunar, así que no ha sido un problema.
 Para realizar llamadas se pueden utilizar las teléfonos ubicados en la planta -1. Si no se tienen monedas, hay una máquita expendedora de tarjetas telefónicas. Os recomiendo esta opción, en vez de realizar llamadas desde el móvil, que sale carísimo, o con tarjetas prepago compradas en el aeropuerto de España. Esto último lo digo por mala experiencia, ya que nosotros compramos una tarjeta de casi 24€, con la que sólo pudimos realizar 3 llamadas cortas a España, es decir, a 8€ cada llamada. Sin embargo, con una tarjeta de 5$, menos de 4€, pudimos realizar dos, o sea, menos de 2€ por llamada, en vez de 8€. Comento esto por si le sirve a alguien.
 Una vez que dejas la habitación, puedes dejar las maletas en el hotel pagando 1$ por cada una.

E' centrale perchè a due passi dall'Empire State Bulding e a pochi isolati da Times Square, la metropolitana è dietro l'angolo, è molto pulito, ottimamente isolato acusticamente, le camere non sono molto grandi, ma ci si sta comodamente, il personale è gentile e chiedendo la view room si ha una bella vista sulla città.

"“Bien ubicado, pero en España no tendría más de 2 estrellas” El New Yorker se ubica en un edificio estupendo, en la 8ª avenida entre las calles 34 y 35, frente al Madison Square Garden, y a pocas manzanas de Times Square, el Empire State, o la estación de autobuses de la Autoridad Portuaria de Nueva York.
El personal es atento y amable. El edificio es enorme, el lobby es gigantesco, motivo por el que con el fin de controlar la seguridad, siempre exigen que se muestre la tarjeta de la habitación para permitir el acceso a los ascensores.
Y hasta aquí lo bueno.
Personalmente me llevé una gran decepción cuando entré en mi habitación en la planta 33, pues en todas las críticas que había leído en Tripadvisor, no reparé en que nadie dijera que las habitaciones eran minúsculas (10 m2 escasos).
La cama de 1,35 estaba prácticamente pegada a la ventana (por detrás de la cama casi no se podía circular), pese a lo cual, apenas quedaba espacio para dejar las maletas, chaquetas, etc.
Las fotos que acompaño creo que reflejan lo minúsculo del habitáculo. Ni siquiera en Tokio he estado en una habitación tan pequeña e incómoda.
Eso sí, al estar en la planta 33, llega poco ruido de la calle, y el aire acondicionado funcionaba correctamente y de forma silenciosa.
Quizá también a causa de la altura, la presión del agua en la ducha no era la adecuada.
Me llamó la atención que no hubiera caja fuerte en la habitación.
Por otro lado, el hotel no sirve desayuno. Hay dos restaurantes, uno a cada extremo del lobby, en los que se puede desayunar y cenar.

Con respecto al servicio, es muy bueno, en mi caso me faltó un adaptador para la notebook y se mataron por conseguirlo. Al final no lo hicieron, pero supieron decirme con facilidad donde conseguirlo (a unas pocas cuadras del hotel). Igualmente una falencia mía obvio no haber previsto este incoveniente.

También nos aconsejó de 10 para cualquier cosa que le preguntamos.

Stock hatten, brachte Fenster aufmachen auch nichts, da das Hotel an einer großen Straße liegt. Die Safes waren in einem extra Raum hinter der Rezeption.

"“l'hôtel parfait pour un séjour parfait” On avait chosi cet hôtel après avoir lu les évaluations sur tripadvisor et on n'a pas été déçus. On a réservé directement sur leur site internet parce qu'ils faisaient des promos en janvier ( je ne me souviens pas de tout mais en gros on a eu chambre top au prix d'une chambre normale, les petits-déjs (basiques) offerts et une carte de 15 dollars à dépenser au Starbucks). tout s'est fait sans problème. On est arrivé à newark on a pris le train pour arriver à Penn Station, ça se fait très bien, et la gare est vraiment tout à côté de l'hôtel. 
En lui-même l'hôtel a beaucoup de charme, très art déco, vraiment ambiance new york c'est super chouette. la chambre était petite mais pour un court séjour ça suffit bien! Tout est très propre. Et puis le gros plus de cet hôtel c'est qu'il est vraiment super bien situé on est resté cinq jours à New-york et on dû prendre le métro 4 fois tout au plus et pourtant nous ne sommes pas des gros marcheurs et il y avait beaucoup de neige dans les rues (mais il faut bien dire que découvrir new york à pied c'est le top!). Et puis le petit bonus en se mettant à l'intersection la plus proche on peut voir l'ESB autant qu'on veut!
En bref, c'est une adresse que je recommande à fond, j'espère pouvoir y retourner un jour!

"“New Yorker : un hôtel bien placé, facile d'accès, propre et pas trop bruyant” Ma chambre n'était pas immense, mais sa taille était tout de même tout à fait correcte (environ 12m²). L'état général est plus que correct (peinture fraîche, eau chaude, pas de bruit venant des autres chambres, bruit extérieur audible mais suffisamment peu gênant pour qu'on s'endorme sans problème après une arrassante journée de visites). Le côté le plus positif, selon moi, est que l'accessibilité est optimale : en étant très proche de Penn Station (qui est la gare souterraine de New York), on a un accès direct aux aéroports (en particulier JFK avec le LIRR). De plus, pour les ballades sur place, on a le métro '34 Street, Penn Station' juste au coin avec les lignes A, C & E. En allant à la prochaine intersection (34ème rue et 7ème avenue), on a les lignes 1, 2 & 3 et en allant à la suivante (34ème rue et 6ème avenue), on a 8 lignes supplémentaires. On peut donc aller dans quasi n'importe quel quartier très facilement. De plus, à pied, on est très proche de plusieurs endroits très interessants : Times Square (15'), Empire State Building (à faire malgré la longue queue, à moins de 10') et tout le le quartier West Midtown est visitable directement à pied.

"“Buon hotel in posizione strategica” Ho soggiornato al New Yorker Hotel per 18 notti tra giugno e luglio 2011. La camera è abbastanza grande per gli standard newyorkesi, comprendeva: un piccolo armadio a muro, una scrivania con sedia da ufficio, un mobile con cassetti ampi, tv lcd con una 30ina di canali free e la possibilità di acquistare film in pay per view, bagno con vasca un po' vecchio ma abbastanza spazioso, wifi a 500Kbs gratis in camera sufficiente per videochiamate skype (nella lobby era sempre gratuita ma più veloce), 9.95$ per 24h per connessione a 5Mbs ma mai provata. La pulizia della camera e del bagno è sempre stata buona, l'assistenza alla reception anche; come è norma in USA viene chiesta una carta di credito a garanzia al check-in, per il deposito bagagli al check-out se ce n'è necessità si pagano 2 $. Non è molto silenzioso, ma la posizione molto centrale comporta i rumori del traffico ovviamente, capita di sentire gli ospiti delle altre camere se per esempio tengono un volume della tv alto. C'è inoltre su Gift Shop nel basement, assieme a un business center e un fitness center che non ho utilizzato.
Più che ottima la posizione sulla 8th Avenue e 34th Street, vicino a: Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, stazione della subway A-C-E blu appena di lato all'hotel, 3 avenue dall'Empire State Builing, 2 blocchi scarsi da Macy's e una serie di altri negozi sulla Broadway, 10 min a piedi da Times Square.

"“Sehr gute Lage!” Das New Yorker Hotel zeichnet sich durch seine perfekte Lage in Manhattan aus: das Empire State Building ist so ziemlich um die Ecke, und auch der Times Square ist bequem zu Fuß zu erreichen. Wir haben sechs Nächte in dem Haus verbracht. Da wir rechtzeitig im Vorraus gebucht hatten, war das Zimmer - für New Yorker Verhältnisse - erschwinglich. Der Raum mit einem Kingsize-Bett war ziemlich klein, jedoch ausreichend und vor allem sauber. Das Fenster ließ sich leider nicht öffnen (25. Stock, vermutlich aus Sicherheitsgründen). Das Einchecken verlief problemlos, das Personal war freundlich. Frühstück war nicht inklusive, aber rund ums Haus gibt es etliche Cafes, meist Ketten, in denen man sich gut versorgen kann. Internet ist nur 24 Stunden kostenlos: Das sollte schon inklusive sein bei einem Zimmerpreis von rund 200 Dollar!
Wir haben nach einer dreiwöchigen Rundreise an der Ostküste nochmals kurzfristig zwei Nächte in New York verbracht - in einem anderen Haus, da das New Yorker Hotel bereits ausgebucht war. Dabei haben wir gesehen, was viel schlechtere Zimmer in New York kosten können, wenn man spontan etwas sucht... fast unbezahlbar.

"“Un buon hotel” Con la mia ragazza ho pernottato al New Yorker hotel dal 28/2 al 10/3/2011 e devo dire che ho avuto molto tempo per vederlo per bene dato che sono stato ammalato 5 giorni e non potevo uscire.Aspetti positivi: è un hotel pulito; gli ascensori sono veloci (cosa da non sottovalutare dato che eravamo al 33esimo piano); accanto ha un simpatico bar/ristorante che si chiama tik-tok che è risultato essere comodissimo anche per la colazione; è in un ottima posizione dato che è praticamente davanti al madison square garden e alla stazione della metropolitana di penn station. Aspetti negativi: non economico come hotel; dalle finestre entravano un sacco di spifferi che raffreddavano velocemente la stanza e quindi dovevamo tenere acceso il riscaldamento (con relativo rumore fastidioso).
L'importante per noi, in questa prima vacanza a New York, era quello di non capitare in un hotel sporco, o in zone non sicure e per questo devo dire che siamo restati soddisfatti. Sarebbe comunque meglio prenotarlo con qualche offerta..
New York comunque mi ha dato l'impressone di essere una città sicura e, quindi, anche se uno decidesse di prenotare un hotel in una zona un po' più periferica non penso che rimarrebbe deluso su quest'aspetto.

L'hotel est art deco a mort, c'est très beau, tous les équipements sont d'époque... 
Chambres petites : impossible de trouver un coin pour poser sa valise, ou sa trousse de toilettes. En revanche c'est propre et bonne literie...
Petit bémol. On a eu l'hotel par NF et on avait une chambre sans vue (au 24e). Pour la vue c'est 30$ par nuit de plus... Deuxième surprise, on a pas mal téléphoné avec carte prépayé.

"“neu renoviert, super Lage” Unser Zimmer lag im 22. Stockwerk, mit Blick auf eine Fensterwand des gleichen Gebäudes. Nachts war es für NY-Verhältnisse erstaunlich ruhig(sowohl im HOtel als auch auf der Strasse), das Zimmer lag zu Seitenstrasse. War uns tausendmal lieber, als Blick auf die Strasse und dafür laut...! Das Hotel wurde 2008 neu renoviert - daher alles komfortabel und sauber, KEINE Bettwanzen, alles sauber. Flachbild-TV. funktionstüchtige und ruhige Heizung/Klima im Zimmer, die Fenster lassen sich einen Spalt zum lüften öffnen. 
Das Hotel liegt in Midtown ca 15 Gehminuten vom Empire- State-Building, 20 Gehminuten zum Times Square. Direkt gegenüber Starbucks, McDonald, Famiglia Pizza (haben eine sehr gute Pizza und Salate!),TGIFridays mit sehr guten Steaks und sehr viele Delis oder Buffet-Bistros - also man kann dort nicht verhungern, muss auch nicht groß suchen, ist für jeden was dabei.
Es bietet einen Transfershuttel vom FLughafen JFK zum Hotel und wieder zurück an...weis leider keinen Preis, kann man dort ja erfragen.
Das Hotel hat direkt nebendran einen Subwayverbindung PennStation 34 Street (die PennStation sowie Madison Square Garden dirket gegenüber). Mit der Linie kann man dirket zur Endstation ""Jamaica Center"" in Queens fahren. Von dort dann mit dem Airtrain zum JFK bzw. umgekehrt. Subway-Metro-Card kostet für 7 Tage 30 $ - hat sich bei uns sehr gelohnt, bzw. Einzelfahrt p.P. 2,25 $. Würde keinen Shuttle-Service mehr im vornhinein buchen. Auch kann man in 5 Min zum Herald Square gehen, dort auch Subway-Verbindung zu mehreren Linien. Sehr praktisch.

"“Il Meglio dello standard per pochi giorni a New York” Sinceramente per noi è stato proprio così! L'Htl- storico e famoso- è vicino alla Penn station e a 20 mt. dal Madison Square: ciò consente di arrivare facilmente con mezzi pubblica dall'aereoporto. Le attrazioni pricipali sono tutte raggiungibili a piedi altrimenti le linee Bus sono accanto all'Htl o nella strada successiva e ciò significa risparmio di tempo!! Siamo stati più volte in questo Htl e recentemente alcuni piani sono stati rinnovati. Abbiamo avuto camere piccole e camere di medie dimensioni proprio a seconda della ristrutturazione, con differenze ovvie di prezzo,ma sempre convenienti. La vista sulla città dal 20°piano in poi è spettacolare al tramonto. Il bagno è ben fornito e solitamente pulito. Ai piani ci sono dispenser x bevande e ghiaccio e comunque nella hall c'è una cafetteria o a fianco un famoso diner aperto 24 ore, dove la colazione può essere richiesta a pagamento ed è sempre abbondante. Nell'htl c'è anche un ristorante Cooper che servepiatti amricani, ma i dintorni sono pieni di possibilità di pasti. Inoltre funziona un servizio Booking per teatri spettacoli e per tutto quanto si voglia fare a NY. Altra comodità è il business center da dove, tramite schede 10$ si può chiamare l'Italia a prezzi vantaggiosi!! La Posta è accanto all'Htl. Ottima la posizione anche per chi vuole solo fare shopping: Macy's e altro a 15minuti. La facilità degli spostamenti ci ha consentito di sfruttare al meglio i 4 gg e di visitare 2 dei maggiori Musei.

Il bagno risulta pulito anche se a colpo d'occhio si vede che ha la sua età. 
La recptionist ci ha cambiato la camera riservata da expedia con una più grande dicendo che in genere se non si fa una prenotazione diretta vengono assegnate camere più piccole. Prezzo adeguato alla qualità.

"“un ottima base, confortevole e di prestigio” Ho trascorso qui una settimana e penso di poter esprimere un giudizio obiettivo. La hall è quella di un hotel di lusso. Il personale è sempre disponibile. La mia camera, al 20esimo piano, è piccola, nel bagno c'è posto solo per i sanitari, ma tanto ci devo solo dormire visto che girerò Manhattan in lungo e in largo! La pulizia,soprattutto del bagno,lascia un po' a desiderare, come per molti hotel metropolitani.
Ottima la cucina della tavola calda annessa all'hotel, Tick Tock Diner, prezzi nella media e grande scelta di pietanze per tutti i gusti.

"“Perfekt” Wir haben im Februar 7 Nächte im The New Yorker verbracht.
Als wir gegen 16h ankamen konnten wir sofort unser Zimmer beziehen, Wartezeit an der Rezeption gab es keine. Das Personal war sehr freundlich.
 Gebucht hatten wir sehr günstig über Expedia ein Zimmer der Kategorie "" Metro mit Queenbed"". 
Nachdem man uns erst in ein Zimmer mit Blick aus einem einzigen halben Fenster im 20. Stock verfrachten wollte haben wir mittels des 20$ Tricks ein kostenloses Upgrade auf ein Zimmer mit grandiosem Hudsonblick im 37. Stock bekommen. Der Blick war tagsüber wie abends der Wahnsinn!
Das Bett hat uns begeistert, einfach bequem und als Queenbed für zwei Leute auch mehr als ausreichend. Zunächst hatte ich Bedenken wegen der einen Bettdecke für zwei Personen, aber diese stellten sich als unbegründet heraus, da die Decke riesig war.
Das Zimmer ist sehr geschmackvoll mit zB Wagenfeld Lampen ausgestattet, auch für die Reisetaschen gab es- entgegen mancher Angaben hier- genügend Platz im "" Wandschrank"".
Wer schreibt, es gäbe nicht genügend Platz für die ganzen Einkäufe, der hat entweder zuviel gekauft, oder nicht platzsparend umgepackt :)
Das Bad war absolut in Ordnung, alles war original mit Art Deco Elementen renoviert. 
Jeden Tag konnte auf Wunsch die Bettwäsche gewechselt, wie auch die Handtücher ausgetauscht werden. Jeden Tag gab es neues Shampoo, Seife, Conditioner, Lotion, sowie neue Zahnputzbecher.
Kostenlose Eiswürfel sind zB im 36. Stock zu haben. 
Ich schätze die Größe des Zimmer auf ca. 14m², plus Bad. Dies war mehr als ausreichend. Die negativen Kommentare bzgl. der Zimmergröße kann ich nicht nachvollziehen. Wir mussten uns nirgends durchquetschen, oder hatten Platzprobleme.

L'assistenza gentile ed onesta della signora che vende i biglietti per i musical e organizza i transfer da e per l'aeroporto ci ha colpiti.
Le stanze dell'hotel sono come si sa piccoline, ma Manhattan è così e alla fine in hotel ci si passa pochissimo tempo che le dimensioni non sono un problema.

"“Si volviera a NY, volvería a este hotel” Nos casamos en agosto y como tantas parejas, elegimos como luna de miel un combinado NY + Riviera Maya y con un ultimo día en Miami pero sin alojarnos allí.
Alucinamos cuando vimos el hotel, pues el edificio es del año 1929, en pleno corazón de Manhattan, a tan sólo dos manzanas del Empire State Building, a una manzana de Macy's y en plena zona comercia de la 8th Av. Desde que volvimos, nos hemos dado cuenta de que en las conexiones de Antena 3 con NY, este hotel sale siempre justo detrás del reportero de turno, vamos, que es un emblema de la ciudad!
El servicio del hotel no es que sea el mejor de todos, eso sí, hablan español, pero en realidad sólo tuvimos trato con ellos a la llegada, pues para el check out dejas la llave de la habitación en un buzón y así te ahorras la típica cola que cabe esperar en un hotel de 40 plantas y cientos de habitaciones...
Nuestra habitación, en la planta 20 era pequeña, y por la ventana sólo veías las ventanas del edificio de en frente, pero como en realidad sólo parabamos allí para dormir tampoco nos importó, pues íbamos a disfrutar de la ciudad, no del hotel. Eso sí, según llegas te ofrecen cambiar a una habitación con mejores vistas tan rápido como esté disponible... pero en nuestro caso era tontería. Hay que pagar una fianza a la llegada por si causas desperfectos en la habitación o por si fumas en ella (las ventanas están bloqueadas y no pueden abrirse, así que el humo del cigarro avisaría rápidamente al detector de humos) En nuestro caso nos devolvieron la fianza cuando nos fuimos. 
Las habitaciones cuentan con internet wifi un poco lento pero que sirve de sobra para consultar planos o información (si lo quieres más rápido es de pago)
Cabe decir que las habitaciones,reformadas hace ya bastantes años (o eso parece) estaban limpias, y el ascensor nos subía 20 pisos en un par de segundos sin sensación de mareo. La cama era bastante cómoda.

Uhr gültig und die Schlangen an wartenden Gästen reichte durch die halbe Lobby. Nicht zu empfehlen. Das Frühstück, das es dann jeodch am dritten Morgen in der Level-Ebene gab auch nicht. Nur das Nötigste, lieblose Atmosphäre und ein absolut überheizter Raum. Nur der Blick zum Chrysler Building und dem Empire - der ist schön. 
Meine Suite war sehr großzügig - zwei Räume, Wohnzimmer mit Tisch für acht Personen und großem Sofa, Schlafzimmer mit zwei Queen-Size Betten. Zudem über Eck und mit tollen Blick über die Skyline. Und in jedem Raum ein Flatscreen TV (ca. 32"").
Nachteil, die Aircondition ist laut und störend aber leider notwendig, da (und das ist der Nachteil eines alten Hotels) die Fenster so undicht sind, dass es (es hatte Temperaturen um den Gefrierpunkt) richtig kalt reinzog. 
Persönlich hat mir die 70er Jahre Gestaltung der Zimmer nicht sonderlich gefallen - zu braun und duster - aber das ist tatsächlich Geschmackssache, zumindest war es sehr groß. Positiv hervorzuheben ist das kostenlose und schnelle WLAN. 
Die Lage ist ok, nicht so trubelig wie Times Square, der aber gut in Walking Distance liegt. Dafür ""fällt"" man förmlich einen Block weiter in Macys und kann die Tüten schnell ins Hotel schleppen. Auch Empire ist ums Eck, dazu kreuzen sich hier fast alle U-Bahnen, man kommt schnell in alle Richtungen. 
Insgesamt war ich von dem Hotel nur mäßig begeistert, zu groß, zu unpersönlich, ein schwacher Service und irgendwie halt doch mehr alter Kasten als Mythos. Und wenn - unbedingt ohne Frühstück buchen.

"“Super klasse - sauber, sicher und zentral gelegen” Ich war im Juli diesen Jahres mit einer Freundin zusammen für drei Tage in New York. Wir wollten nicht irrsinnig viel Geld für ein Hotel ausgeben, wir waren einfach nur auf der Suche nach einem sicheren, sauberen Hotel in guter Lage. Und das The New Yorker hat die Erwartungen auf jeden Fall übertroffen.
Das Zimmer war zwar nicht riesig aber es war sauber, die Bettwäsche sah ganz neu aus, das Badezimmer war blitzblank und der Wasserdruck war super. Die Klimaanlage funktionierte auch gut - das war wichtig, wir hatten eine Hitzewelle erwischt. Dank der guten Lage (direkt bei Macy's & Madison Square Garden und nur ein paar hundert Meter vom Empire State Building entfernt) konnten wir im Laufe des Tages mehrfach im Hotel vorbeischauen, Einkäufe abstellen und kurz unter die Dusche springen.

"“Ottimo per visitare New York” Siamo stati una settimana a New York, dal 14 al 21 Dicembre 2010. Una settimana particolarmente fredda! L'hotel si trova in posizione strategica, ha la metro a 15 metri dalla hall ed è in pieno centro sull' ottava strada. La nostra stanza al 32 piano (stanza 3208) era molto carina (anche se piccolina ma in linea con NYC) e con il bagno dotato di vasca. Il letto e cuscini sono molto comodi. Nella dotazione della camera ci sono inoltre, ferro da stiro con relativa asse nel ripostiglio armadio, TV color LCD marca LG da 32"" HD ready, Climatizzazione con riscaldamento della camera molto valido e regolabile in maniera efficace. L'unica cosa negativa sono i serramenti che lasciano passare molti spifferi, e con la lastra di ghiaccio che trovavamo al mattino sul vetro vi posso garantire che non è il massimo! abbiamo cmq tamponato con le tende tirate e climatizzatore a 23 gradi per fare un po di barriera... !
Nella struttura c'è anche la LAVANDERIA con macchine per asciugare! una grande comodità se si è in giro per parecchio tempo. Il personale si è sempre rivelato cortese e disponibile, tranne quelli addetti ai trasferimenti.
L'hotel dispone di un ottimo servizio di vigilanza e di controllo 24h su 24h.
Il ristorante TICK TOCK che non è gestito dall' hotel è una vera schifezza! scortesi, cari e si mangia male, da evitare a meno che non si sia bloccati da una tempesta di neve in quanto a poche centinaia di metri è pieno di altri locali ottimi.

Le camere sono molto molto piccole ma fortunatamente pulite, il bagno non è spazioso ma abbastanza funzionale anche se non ci sono mensole per appoggiare le proprie cose e per quanto riguarda la qualità del sonno, a parte i cuscini scomodissimi, rumori o traffico stradale non ne ho sentiti ma tenete conto che la mia stanza era al 19° piano!

"“Hotel très bien situé, bon rapport qualité/prix” je reviens d'un séjour de 7 nuits au New Yorker Hotel. C'est un hotel très bien placé: on trouve juste devant l'hotel la station Penn station. Il se trouve à 5 minutes de Times square et à 2 pas du Madison square garden.
La chambre: nous étions 3, nous étions donc logés dans une chambre avec 2 grands lits. Elle était très propre (le ménage était fait dans la matinée).Elle est équipée d'un écran plat, d'un radio réveil, de l'accés wifi gratuit et de la climatisation. La salle de bains comportait un lavabo, un WC et une baignoire, le tout aussi très propre.Seul petit inconvénient, la taille de la chambre qui est petite pour 3 ou4 personnes, surtout avec les valises.
L'hotel comporte un restaurant ouvert 24h/24h: le tick tock. Nous y avons pris un petit déjeuner. Tarifs un peu chers: un pancake avec oeufs brouillés et 3tranches de bacon grillés environ 12$.
Pour déjeuner, à quelques mètres de l'hotel se trouve un deli nommé amici 62. Là il est possible de prendre un bon petit déjeuner pour 5 $.
L'hotel est très grand, très propre, le personnel est aimable, mais il très ou même trop climatisé. Nous y avons passé un très bon séjour.",milou31,2010-07-01,122005,2010-07-31,False,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.4,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

La habitación, la cama y las sábanas son muy confortables. Tan solo el baño tiene alguna pega: en las bañeras se nota la antigüedad y falta alguna estantería o mueble para apoyar los neceseres.
No debe preocuparos si vais sin desayuno incluido, porque la calle está llena de Starbucks y otros sitios en los que comprar un café y unos muffins buenísimos. El personal es amable, incluidas las camareras de piso, que te sonríen y saludan por los pasillos.

"“praktische Lage zur Penn Station / Madison Square - leider zu teuer” Das einzig Gute an diesem Hotel ist seine Lage - wenn man zur Penn Station muss oder Madison Square Garden. Aus diesem Grund buchten auch wir zwei Nächte im The New Yorker. Die erste Nacht für schlappe $385, die zweite für $230.
Check-in Time ist 3pm, wir waren um 3.30pm da - zusammen mit noch ca. 30 anderen Gästen vor uns in der Schlange, mit denen die 2 Angestellten an der Rezeption leider etwas überfordert waren. Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit 2 queen beds reserviert, was dann aber angeblich noch nicht fertig war. Nach ewigem Hin und Her wurde uns dann doch ein Zimmer im 25. Stock zugewiesen, was leider direkt neben dem Aufzug und der dröhnenden Vending-Machine lag. Immerhin konnte man wie versprochen das Empire State Building sehen. Wir verlangten ein ruhigeres Zimmer und mussten dann noch 3 mal das Zimmer wechseln, bis wir schliesslich doch entnervt wieder das erste Zimmer nahmen. Die anderen vorgeschlagenen Zimmer waren noch schlimmer: zuerst wollte man uns weiss machen, dass die kleine Besenkammer mit nur einem queen bed der gleiche Tarif wäre, wie unser gebuchtes Zimmer, das nächste Zimmer war zwar grösser - aber nur ein einziges kleines Fenster, das dritte Zimmer war wieder eine kleine Besenkammer mit Fenster zum Innenhof. Angeblich alles für den gleichen Tarif.
Schliesslich bot man uns ein Upgrade in eine Tower Suite für $60 extra pro Nacht an. Wir lehnten entnervt ab und nahmen das Gebimmel des Lifts und das Dröhnen des Getränkeautomats in Kauf und ärgerten uns über den unverschämten Preis - für den wir auch ein Zimmer im Waldorf Astoria bekommen hätten.
Die Zimmer sind zwar renoviert, jedoch liegt der Muff schon ganz schön in dem alten Gemäuer und dem ekligen Teppichboden. Die Gänge sind abgeranzt, das Bad ist einfach und Service gibt es so gut wie keinen.
Zwar gibt es kostenloses ""Breitband-Internet"" per WiFi, allerdings so langsam, dass man auch schon mal 2 Minuten auf das Laden einer Seite wartet. Das wirklich schnelle Internet verkauft das Hotel seinen Gästen natürlich für zusätzliche $19.95 am Tag.
Auch das angeschlossene Tick Tock Diner ist zwar ok - aber 2 Ecken weiter gibt es das Skyline Diner, bei dem es einen French Toast auch für $5 gibt und nicht für $9,95 . . .

"“svegliarsi a New York” Siamo stai al New Yorker Hotel nel mese di marzo 2010. L'abbiamo scelto su consiglio di un amico agente di viaggi che ci aveva trovato un'offerta e ci ha detto di non aver mai sentito lamentele circa questo Hotel e in effetti devo dire che la scelta è stata azzeccata. Prima di tutto l'hotel è ben gestito, molto pulito e le dimensioni delle camere standard non sono nemmeno troppo piccole. Il bagni sno un po' retrò ma tutto sommato funzionali quindi niente da ridire in proposito. Noi eravamo al 32° piano (in tutto ci sono 40 piani) e avevamo un splendida vista sull'Empire State Building. da quello che mi risulta le stanze occupano i piani dal 20° in su e questo è ottimo per evitare di sentire il rumore della strada. L'Hotel si trova a due passi dal Madison Square Garden, è all'incrocio con la 34th street piena di negozi e anche di una farmacia aperta 24 ore su 24. IN pochi minuti a piedi si arriva all'Empire e ai grandi magazzini MAcy's. In un quarto d'ora si può raggiungere a piedi Times Square percorrendo strade assolutamente tranquille anche la sera. la fermata della Metro è attaccata all'Hotel. Avendo avuto problemi con la valigia, che la compagnia aerea mi ha riconseganto solamente dopo 48 ore dal mio arrivo a NEw York, ho trovato buona disponibilità da parte della reception che ha telefonato per me al servizio clienti della compagnia aerea per conoscere lo stato della mia pratica. Una menzione va anche al banco delle informazioni turistiche dal quale è anche possibile prenotare biglietti per il teatro nonchè la navetta per l'aeroporto, il tutto con l'assistenza di una signora gentilissima.

"“Zentral, sauber, kaum Auskunft” Im April diesen Jahres buchten wir über expedia das New Yorker, da uns die Lage, Renovierung und der damit verbundene Preis (eine Woche pro Person 551 €) überzeugte. 
Vom Flughafen Newark ist das Hotel sowohl mit ShuttleBus (Hinfahrt ca. 30 Min) als auch mit dem NY Transit (Rückfahrt: PennStation 200m vom Hotel für 15 €) sehr gut erreichbar. Für den täglichen Gebrauch ist die Metro (Linien A, C und E) einmal direkt um das Hotel herum oder gegenüber vom Hotel. Um die Linien 1, 2 und 3 zu erreichen war ein Fußweg von 4 Minuten nötig. Generell ist von diesem Hotel aus das Empire (10 Minuten Fusßweg), der Times Square (8 Minuten Fußweg), Madison Square (1 Minute) oder aber auch der nächste H&M oder Macys (5 Minuten) perfekt erreichbar. Wer kein Frühstück bucht, kann für 2 Personen im Cafe Bistro am CINEMA (um das Hotel herum) Kaffee und Bagel für knapp 4 $ bekommen. Auch Lunch und Dinner sind zu genießen, wenn man den geldbeutel schonen möchte. Ansonsten ist gegenüber vom Hoetl auch MC oder Starbucks. 
Das Hotel selbst ist sauber und gepflegt. Das Housekeeping Team war immer freundlich und hat gute Arbeit geleistet. Leider wurden uns bei der Ankunft direkt beim Check In 300 $ abgenommen, weil wir keine Kreditkarte hatten und das Hotel PrePaid bezahlt hatten. Diese wurden uns für evt. Telefonate, Internet abgenommen in einem sehr unfreundlichen Ton. Auch sonstige Auskünfte wurden stets wiederwillig und nur genervt gegeben. Unser Zimmer war ein Metro 2-Doppelbetten Raum und wirklich geräumig für New York.
Alles in Allem ist das Hotel, wenn günstig zu buchen, zu empfehlen, da die Lage sehr gut ist und das Hotel sauber und renoviert ist .",Lenchen2406,2010-04-01,122005,2010-04-29,False,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Cuando volvimos a new york la segunda vez para quedarnos tres noches, nos dieron una habitacion aun mas pequeña, sin vistas ni terraza, es mas nos atendieron en recepcion fatal y nos dijeron que daba igual que fueramos recien casados, vamos que quedamos muy disgustados y nada contentos.

"“Grande Vista sulla Grande Mela” Ho alloggiato in questo albergo con un gruppo di amiche nell'agosto del 2008 per una settimana. La posizione è assolutamente fantastica. Nel cuore della Midtown Manhattan, a pochi metri si raggiunge la metropolitana e alcune delle principale attrazioni di NY: madison square garden, empire state bulding, crysler bulding. La fifht avenue è a pochi passi cosi come times square.
L'albergo è un vero e proprio grattacielo, la mia stanza si trovava al 36° piano molto spaziosa e confortevole, e si godeva di una vista spettacolare... 
Lo staff dell'albergo non è dei migliori in quanto a simpatia e disponibilità... Infatti appena arrivate, in piena notte.. abbiamo scoperto una spiacevole sorpresa... le nostre camere non erano disponibili, dicevano che era tutto occupato e che ci aspettavano per il giorno successivo in quanto erano stati informati che il nostro volo era stato cancellato. (???) Armate di pazienza siamo riuscite a farci dare una sistemazione.

“Central” le New Yorker est un Hotel des années 20 récemment repris et réaménagé par le groupe Ramada. On bénéficie ainsi d'un immeuble à l'architecture typique et du confort moderne. Les chambres sont petites (comme toujours à New-York) mais cependant silencieuses et très confortables. On se trouve en face de Penn station qui est le noeud principal des transports en commun de la ville de New-York.

La mayoria del personal habla Español, cosa importante si no tienes mucha idea de ingles, y además son muy agradables. En cuanto a la habitacion era pequeña pero lo justo tampoco se necesita más.

"“Schön aber sehr kleine Zimmer!” Das Hotel war wirklich toll. Man hatte gratis Internet (Wlan) sowie ein sauberes Zimmer und ein sauberes Bad. 
Aussicht war nicht so toll, da wir diese auf die nächste Backsteinwand hatten. 
Die Zimmer waren seeeeehr klein! Wir hatten Schwierigkeiten, uns am Morgen frei bewegen zu können :o) Lassen sie sich jedoch von den Bewertungen bezüglich der kleinen Zimmer nicht abschrecken. Kann man nur Geld für ein Mittelklassehotel zusammenkratzen, so bekommt man in New York AUSSCHLIESSLICH kleine Zimmer. Um ein großes Zimmer zu erhalten muss man eben im Astoria buchen, was weit mehr Geld kostet (und da kostet dieses Hotel hier schon ein kleines Vermögen) :o)
Die Lage ist phänomenal! Man ist mitten im Geschehen. Für das leibliche Wohl empfehle ich, ab und zu mal im J J Applebaum's (431 7th Ave) vorbeizuschauen. Dort gibt es alles was das Herz begehrt und das sogar im Buffetformat :o) Bezahlt wird nach Gewicht.

"“Ottimo hotel nella West Midtown” Il New Yorker è un hotel molto comodo che si trova sull'8th av. all'incrocio con la 34th st.

Nello stesso isolato dell'hotel si trova la fermata della metro.

L'hotel offre diversi servizi utili tra cui le cassette di sicurezza gratuite, le macchine del ghiaccio (non c'è il frigo in camera), un negozio di souvenir, un ristorante aperto 24 ore su 24 e un piccolo banco/bar per acquistare una colazione veloce da asporto (che si può tranquillamente consumare sui divani della hall!).

"“cozyな。。。居心地の良いホテルでした。” 初めてのニューヨーク一人旅。3泊5日の予定だったので、短いし立地条件の良いホテルじゃないと移動時間がもったいない!と思ってミッドタウンのホテルを探しました。場所は34St. 8番街。
一人旅だとパック旅行やツアーでは追加料金がかかり高くなってしまうので、航空券とホテルは別々に予約。仕事の都合もあり、室内のワイヤレスインターネットが必要だったので、その料金も考えると、このホテルのシングルのMetroルームは比較的安上がりでした。
客室は800以上ある結構大きなホテルです。18階から40階がお部屋になっているようです。私た泊まったのは34階。
決して広くはないけれど、テレビの下には大きなチェスともあって、小さい扉付きの部屋に備え付けのクローゼットもありました。ドライヤーとアイロンも部屋についていました。このベッドの左側にデスクとチェアがあり仕事もできました。
バスルームも清潔でしたし、快適に過ごすことができました。一人旅で、やはりホステルじゃなくてホテルがいい。という人にはお薦めかも。
良く旅行会社のパック旅行でセットになっている、ホテルペンシルバニアからそんなに遠くない場所です。日本人はこのホテルでは見かけませんでした。

"“Muy buen Hotel!” Estuvimos en el New Yorker del 5 al 10 de Diciembre de 2008. Me ayudó bastante a decidirme por este Hotel las críticas que leí en TripAdvisor. Con mi novia queríamos un Hotel con buen servicio y sobre todo, limpio y bien ubicado. Habíamos pedido un ""early check-in"" ya que arribamos a las 8:00 AM a JFK, y a las 11:30AM ya estabamos en el hotel. Nos habían dicho que iban a hacer todo lo posible. Pero cuando llegamos, la habitación que nos iban a dar todavía estaba ocupada. Dejamos las maletas ahí y empezamos la recorrida (comrpandome una filmadora en B&H que está a la vuelta de la esquina) y saboreando un Caramel Macchiatto en el Starbucks de enfrente. Cuando volvimos estaban limpiándola, entonces hicimos más tiempo almorzando en el Tick Tock Diner. Cuando finalmente hacemos el check-in, cerca de las 2:00 PM, nos hicieron un upgrade a una suite por los inconvenientes de no habernos podido dar la habitación cuando llegamos.
Luego, durante la estadía, el servicio fue impecable. La primer noche sufrimos un poco el frio por una entrada de aire a traves de la ventana, pero al día siguiente estaba todo solucionado. Cuaqluier consulta, estaban todos a nuestro servicio, y la mayoría del personal del front desk habla español! El desayuno en el piso 39 con sus excelentes vistas fue siempre bien aprovechado.

Questo hotel è non fumatori e all'inizio ci hanno accreditato una specie di penale sul fumo, che alla partenza ci è stata restituita non ho ben capito come funziona ma penso sia un deterrente per impedire di fumare nelle camere. La vista dal 35° piano merita veramente una nota. Abbiamo usufruito delle cassette di sicurezza gratuite, ma abbiamo dovuto pagare 3$ per la custodia delle valige il giorno della partenza, i bagni nel piano inferiore della hall sono accessibili sono con l'uso della carta magnetica della camera o se si è già riconsegnata basta chiedere alla reception, buon modo per non dare accesso a persone non del hotel. In sostanza è stato un buon hotel penso che se dovessi tornare a New York tornerei in questo hotel peccato che nessuno parli italiano o si sforzi di capirlo.....",lela63,2009-03-01,122005,2009-04-01,False,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Super Hotel!” Wir waren im märz für eine Woche in new york und wir waren mit dem Hotel mehr als zufrieden. Wir waren schon auf alles gefasst,da man hier viele positive aber auch negative bewertungen liest, aber ich kann nichts von dem negativen wiedergeben. unser hotelzimmer war im 20. Stock. Nachts hatten wir kaum was vom lärm draußen gehört,obwohl unser Zimmer direkt auf der 34th Street lag. Das Zimmer war jedesmal sauber und der Service war sehr gut. Wir konnten unsere Koffer für 2Dollar am Abreisetag in einem extra Zimmer stehen lassen. Die Lage ist nach meiner Meinung sehr gut. Wir konnten alles schnell erreichen. Das Macys, ESB;Times Square und der Broadway sind locker in ein paar Minuten zu erreichen.Außerdem ist gleich neben dem Hotel eine Subway mit der man zum Beispiel zum Grand Zero fahren kann.Am Hotel stehen jeden Tag genug Taxis mit denen man wieder zurück zum Airport kommt.

Mitten in Manhatten, also man kommt schnell nach Downtown oder Uptown. Es sollte aber auch erwähnt werden, dass eine Bahnhofsgegend natürlich nicht die Beste ist und der ein oder andere Obdachlose bzw. unangenehmere Personen dort abends unterwegs sind.

"“Bien situado y confortable” Bueno, por lo visto voy a repetir lo que dice todo el mundo:
- El hotel esta bien situado, cerca de Brodway y Times Square, ademas tienes la linea Azul del metro justo en la esquina y a menos de una manzana la linea Roja.
- Es ideal si vas a New York poco tiempo pues esta en el centro.
- Las habitaciones no son tan grandes como parecen en la foto pero son aceptables teniendo en cuenta lo caro que es el m2 en NY y sobretodo con camas comodas y limpias.
- En general bien, como detalle hay plantas con maquinas de hielo, imagino que si te toca una habitación cerca y tienes sueño ligero puede ser un problema.",Pepe_Puntazo,2008-12-01,122005,2009-01-08,False,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Consigliatissimo!!!” Sono stata al New Yorker Hotel per due volte, una prima della ristrutturazione e una post. Dalla ristrutturazione l'albergo è migliorato tantissimo, le camere standard sono piccine ma molto confortevoli, arredate in maniera impeccabile e soprattutto molto pulite!! Il personale è molto cordiale: vista la mia prima esperienza con stanza affacciata su muro (unica pecca secondo me di alcune delle stanze) ho richiesto tramite mail una stanza con vista migliore e la mia richiesta è stata accolta con molto entusiasmo ed ovviamente esaudita. Addirittura un uscere si ricordava di me da un anno all'altro. Sistemazione quindi ottima e consigliatissima, in posizione strategica proprio di fronte al madison square garden, a pochi passi da macy's,ad un paio di isolati da times square e dall'empire state building.",nanania,2008-08-01,122005,2009-01-02,False,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.7,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave
"“Très bon séjour - prix élevé” Nous avons eu la chance d'aller au New Yorker après les travaux. Le lobby n'était pas encore 100% terminé (ils ont posé la fresque derrière le desk pendant que nous y étions), mais notre chambre était impeccable : déco entièrement refaite et sympa, chambre propre, salle de bain petite mais suffisante, surtout selon les critères européens.
Nous y avons séjourné du 28 octobre au 31 octobre 2008, juste avant le marathon, ce qui explique peut-être le prix de la chambre.
Nous avons été bien reçu, et le séjour s'est parfaitement bien déroulé. La Concierge a été extrêmement aimable lors de notre réservation de places de théatre. 
La chambre était une chambre double au 27ème étage. J'ai lu des critiques qui parlaient du bruit de la climatisation et de la rue. En effet, ce n'est pas parfaitement silencieux, mais avec des boules quiès, aucun soucis. La salle de bain contenait les toilettes, un lavabo, une baignoire pouvant faire douche et un grand miroir. Les serviettes et le linge de lit étaient propres. 
Bien entendu, la chambre n'est pas grande, mais est suffisante quand on est à New York pour visiter. Et il y avait du Wifi gratuit.
L'hôtel est extrêmement bien situé : à 200m de Penn Station, au niveau des rues contenant l'Empire State Building, Macy's, la cathédrale St Patrick, etc. Il y a beaucoup à visiter sur les quelques rues à hauteur de l'hôtel. Et le soir, cela a été facile de revenir à pied du théatre où nous avons été.
Nos seuls regrets concernant notre hôtel : tout d'abord le prix. Mais c'est New-York. Ensuite, la chambre ne proposait pas de couverture supplémentaire, ni de petite bouilloire avec du matériel pour se faire du thé. Enfin, nous n'avons pas été voir leur zone de petit-déjeuner, car cela semblait encore en travaux, et pas très tentant.",PaulineParis,2008-10-01,122005,2008-11-15,False,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.3,1,4.0,The New Yorker Hotel,New York City,10001,481 Eighth Ave

Cet hotel est vraiment tres bien situe, de plus nous avons eu droit a une chambre (et sa salle de bain) renovee, qui etait tres sympa.

"“Decepcionante” En mi primera visita a Nueva York, y tras leer algunas críticas, me decidí a reservar este hotel. Tengo entendido que los hoteles en esta ciudad son, por lo general, mediocres y caros. Por este motivo, no esperaba gran cosa.
Lo único bueno que puedo decir del New Yorker es que su situación es magnífica, muy cercano a varias estaciones de metro, a Times Square y frente al Madison Square Garden. Además dispone de wifi gratuito en las habitaciones.
Por lo demás, me parece excesivamente caro para la categoría que tiene:
- Las habitaciones son diminutas. Apenas hay sitio para colocar la maleta y el mini armario más bien parece un ""escobero"". Las camas son pequeñas e incómodas.
- El baño está bastante anticuado, pide una remodelación a gritos.
En cuanto a la limpieza, no me puedo quejar, era correcta.
Este hotel dispone de un servicio de transporte al aeropuerto. Recomiendo a todo el mundo que NO LO UTILICEN. Los chóferes intentaron engañarnos cobrándonos 10 dólares más que un taxi normal. Como no lo consiguieron pasaron a hablarnos muy groseramente. Además impidieron que el botones pudiera ayudarnos con el equipaje y nos espantaron algun taxi. Fue vergonzoso.

"“faux départ rattrapage après d'ou une note mitigée” Le New Yorker Ramada est un hotel très bien placé dans New York. Près de station de métro et proche de l'Empire State Building. Le hic lors du chek in le hold pris sur la carte bleue (c'est à dire une sorte de caution en cas de dégradation de la chambre) au lieu d'être de 270 $ fut du quadruple le taux de retrait possible avec la carte bleue en fut affecté. Angoisse...En signe de bonne volonté nous avons eu droit à une suite et là nous devons dire que c'état superbe vue sur l'ESB, un salon avec flat TV et chambre avec flat TV aussi. Le desk d'acceuil a superbement rattrapé le coup. Autre petit hic les portier qui disposant d'un certain pouvoir ont demandé à ma femme de se déplacer et de ne pas se situer près de la rue mais au contraire contre l'immeuble. Il a laissé une autre femme stationnée à l'endroit où ma femme se trouvait deux secondes avant. cela signifie t-il que ma femme lui plaisait moins ou que comme il s'agissait de jour de départ nous étions moinsinterressant??? donc les portiers bof bof bof. le restaurant qui fait petit déjeuner bof c'est le Tick Tock allez y avec les vêtements de la veille car une odeur de gras vous colle à la peau. hélas.

"“Situation idéale” Situé dans Midtown Manhattan, à l'angle de la 34th street et 8th avenue, le New Yorker est idéalement situé dans la ville. Il se trouve à 2 pas de Madison Square Garden, à 1 bloc de Macy's et 3 de l'Empire State Building. En marchant 15-20 minutes, on arrive à Times Square et Broadway.
Le métro est juste à côté également. Il est direct vers Upper West Side (Central Park Ouest), World Trade Center, Wall Street et South Ferry d'où on prend le ferry vers Liberty Island (Statue de la Liberté). On peut aussi marcher un bloc et prendre une autre ligne qui va vers les magasins de la 5th avenue (Apple Store, Bloomingdale's, Levi's, Niketown etc)
L'hôtel lui-même présente bien. C'est un gratte ciel de plus de 30 étages avec près d'un milliers de chambres et suites et desservis par une dizaine d'ascenseurs. Le décor fait très art déco et c'est bien intégré à l'architecture de l'hôtel. Le lobby est spacieux et comprend un espace café.
La chambre qu'on a eue était exigue mais confortable et avec vue sur NY. Elle comprenait un lit double (très confortable), un bureau, un placard avec une planche et un fer à repasser, une télé écran plat avec toutes les chaines, une salle de bain avec baignoire (ma seule vraie critique sera pour la salle de bain: pas de place pour poser sa trousse de toilette et eau chaude qui tarde à venir pour la douche).
Il y a le Wi-Fi gratuit dans tout l'hôtel. La salle de bain est pourvue d'un sèche cheveux, de shampooing, de savon et de gel douche. L'hôtel comprend aussi un fitness center gratuit mais je ne l'ai pas essayé ni vu.
Pour le petit déjeuner, l'hôtel est pourvu d'un restaurant tout de chromes et de loupiottes (ça fait très américain) qui sert des petits déjeuners copieux (pancakes, french toasts, eggs & bacon, waffles) pour 6 à 10$ suivant ce qu'on prend.
Au check out, on peut laisser ses bagages à la consigne pour 1$ par valise. On peut également réserver un taxi de l'hôtel pour l'aéroport, mais attention, il vous en coûtera 20$ de plus qu'un taxi jaune traditionnel (donc 75$ au lieu de 55$).
